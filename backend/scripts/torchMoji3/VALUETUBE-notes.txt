- Go through commentsEmojid table and remove any comments with duplicate Text field,
there may be some videos added twice if they are the most popular videos in multiple regions
videos were grabbed from (NZ, AU, US, etc). Maybe do a "SELECT" statement for each VideoID, then a "SELECT DISTINCT" for each
Text field? Some comments may have a similar/identical Text field between each VideoID so need to take this into consideration.
- Maybe add region code as a field as well as a future stretch goal - can draw comparisons between emotional content on
different popular videos between Countries and cultures e.g. interesting that among Australian videos, the most popular
video with the most red angry faces (emoji 32 in emoji_overview.png) was a youtube video for NRL highlights.
- Figure out if using the deepmoji model for languages other than English is possible - transfer learning?
Or maybe some kind of translator (e.g. google translate may have an API and this may be good enough to get the meaning of words simply for tokenization).
- Try and make more processing use the GPU, particularly for transfer learning

- We can use clustering to reduce dimensionality of dataset
