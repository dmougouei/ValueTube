Last week I went on a trip with my dad to France, but that same trip was actually made in a  lorry (or truck), (since my dad is an actuall truck driver), and it kinda lets you out of your comfort zone simply because not everything is accessible  when your on the road.  I think that that same trip would make you see how the industrial and logistical part of the modern world works and therefore you could share how the experience was with your subscribers. All you would need to do was to find a truck driver that was willing to take you on that type of ride which I would say is a really simple thing for you to do",0.24261486530303955,53,20,62,10,7,0.058385692999999995,0.051721795999999993,0.04810564,0.04282572,0.041576017,7

ANrZwJ0cFgs,"The challenge to all gay men and women and all LGBTQ+ people everywhere.  When you are at a club or bar (even with your boyfriend) do you notice the guy in the corner, on the wall, or standing at the edge of the dance floor? He really doesn't have the ""perfect"" body, maybe a little overweight or skinny, maybe not the best looking guy may be shy or bashful, he doesn't talk to anyone and doesn't interact with any groups. Do you seek this person out to make them feel welcome?  Do you and your boyfriend walk over and one of you ask him to dance?  Do you notice him at all? If you answered no, that is my problem with the gay community at bars and clubs.  When I was young and going to the local gay bar, I was shy and had not been around any gay people that were out.  No one in my high school was gay/out and it was hard for me to interact and get to know people.  I was skinny (about 145lbs and 28"" waist) and looked nothing like you, not ugly but definitely not handsome.  I would have loved for someone to walk up and introduce themselves, ask me to dance or join the group at a table.  It would take a couple of drinks before I got the courage to talk to people and even then there were massive amounts of rejections, not talking about asking someone out or to hook up but introducing myself, starting a conversation anything to be noticed and I would get shut down, ignored or they walked away. I got offers for one night stands but that wasn't what I was looking for and many many times the offers were because they wanted to take my virginity not know me. I disappeared from the club for about a year after being fed up and when I returned I became an actor portraying a person that I was not, self-confident, funny, outgoing and it wore me down pretending to be this happy person that was always just walking up and talking to people and groups and entertaining when all I wanted was for someone to like ME, be my friend, get to know ME.  I didn't find that, for years and it was not at a club or bar.  I went to the gay group, functions and met some people but they were like me so we hung around the outside of the circle once again. With age, I developed a thicker skin and a don't give a damn attitude.  At this point in my life, people like me or they don't and I have no time to waste on them if they are arrogant, conceded, rude or they think because they have a perfect body and the Hollywood looks they can ignore me or that I don't matter.  So next time you go out and see the young guy in the corner, standing against the wall or on the edge of the dance floor, really look at him, is he wanting someone to talk to him, is he shy, does he have any friends there?  If you don't think he has friends there then I challenge you to make the first move, introduce yourself, ask him to dance, ask him to join you at your table, get his phone number, and call or text him the next time you go out.  Ask him to join you and your boyfriend for lunch, a movie or whatever, get him involved and introduce him to your friends, he might be the future husband of your friend.  I challenge everyone to do the same, find the loner, the shy guy, and welcome him.  He may physically unable to walk up to people and start a conversation because of his insecurity or anxiety.  Make the first move, make a new friend, you can never have too many friends and he may become your new best friend and/or your friends new  boyfriend/husband.  Please please please do this challenge, YOU can change someone's life.",0.2258152924478054,19,25,12,41,22,0.058107505999999996,0.051741075,0.044337913,0.039351567999999996,0.03227723,0

FddzW2GQGHo,"Hi Cartia! I think its amazing that you want to have open discussions about your mental health. As a psychology student its great to see people wanting to reduce the stigma around mental health. It is also important to discuss conditions/diagnoses that are not as commonly spoken about. There are many areas that need more research and there is a problem of over-diagnosis in many circumstances. However, if youre not a qualified clinician/researcher I think it is a huge slippery slope to say you want to make an informative video on a topic youre only learning about from podcasts. 100% podcasts can be amazing resources but when sharing information other people (professionals or not) have said things can get lost in translation/taken out of context. For example saying psychologists dont scan the brain. Many clinics do, or hopefully refer someone to get scanned! Not all but saying all psychologists dont is misinformed. Furthermore a lot of research focuses on observing brain activity/brain tissue mass in certain areas of the brain and seeing what behaviours etc correlate with that. Im not invalidating youre experience as its very clear its been a tough road for you but from what youve said it sounds like you havent seen a professional re the PCS? Self diagnosing is really dangerous - if you feel like you resonate with symptoms of PCS then go to a professional and discuss it with them. If you have been seeing a professional and have spoken to them about this then thats awesome! Im happy to see youre taking your mental health seriously and opening a discussion up but please be careful with how you go about doing so!

H5IGBkvz7Us,"Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that.  Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.

H5IGBkvz7Us,"Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that.  Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.

HiOGAYOXN8U,"I love this channel, one of the only ones I subscribed too... ever. But this is the first ever comment feel I had to make on a clip. Pre-loading your front break?! Really?! You want to kill bikers?  This is bad for so many reasons: 1. It means I permanently show my break light, sending a confusing message behind me at best. And when I actually break, the driver behind me, who doesn't believe my break light anymore by this time, will slam into me. 2. Keeping my fingers under constant tension will numb the sensory input to my brain. After time I will not feel how hard I actually pull on the lever anymore. Letting go will actually feel like pushing out. This makes it so much harder to actually dose the amount of force I am applying to the break-lever. So when I do need to break, my muscles are completely cramped and locked up, and I can't dose the amount I pull very well. 3. The break-pads are in constant contact with the disk. They do not retract and leave space between the pads and the disk (except some micro mm). So even the smallest amount of pull will start friction between them. This will wear out my pads and worse, warm up the disks. So when I do need to break, I'm running almost overheated disks and worn out warm pads...  Look i love the channel and I love the scientific approach of it, as much as the street-smart underdog approach. The videos, I watch almost as soon as they come out... but this advice is just awful. Learn how to make emergency stops with your bike. Get the muscle memory of how hard you can break your bike imprinted in your brain. And adjust your safe distance according to how hard/ safe you can break in the conditions that you are driving in. If you can't do these things, buy a car.  I did like the rest of the clip, as I always do. The rubber - glass transition part I didn't know and I liked the explanation on the matter.

HiOGAYOXN8U,"You missed one important Habit for riding in groups to avoid that accordion effect. When in a group, always ride one left one right. this doubles the potential braking headroom without pulling the group to far across. On that pre loading brake I dont like that, better is to simply learn and memorize the motion of fast braking, like on the Racetrack. Since I'm racing, taking out the slop and progressivly loading the tire just went into blood and is easiely applied even under ""panic braking conditions"".

With this pandemic going on, I'm just glad it's happening as we need any form of sporting entertainment. All in all I remain calm hoping Tryon doesn't lose it and hurt Roy.   From what I see, Tyson has the edge both offensively and defensively (in regard to giving and taking a hard punch)",0.30913566425442696,58,13,0,14,38,0.09364623,0.06750188,0.051476445,0.0502662,0.04624491,5

aj8NDOA0Sgw,About 5 min's in. Not an infinite pole. You did not create any new matter. You only attatched the top to the bottem. You basically created a straight circle.  Imagining a cirlce also helsp answer the second question. Imagine the pole as a circle suspended in mid air. Now bend the gravitational pull acting on the object accordingly. At any point in the circle graviational pulls the cilinder to spin. The pole would go in an infinte freefall.  p.s. In Game physics portals dissapear from moving surfaces.  I imagine this would cut the pole in half.

anLkqccD1oo,"(our Lord Jesus Christ said) Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where I am going.  Thomas said to him, Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way? Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him. Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, you will keep my commandments.  And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world? Jesus answered him, If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.  Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, ""Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."" Jesus answered him, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."" Nicodemus said to him, ""How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"" Jesus answered, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit."" Nicodemus said to him, ""How can these things be?"" Jesus answered him, ""Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."" After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing. John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized (for John had not yet been put in prison). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification. And they came to John and said to him, ""Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witnesslook, he is baptizing, and all are going to him."" John answered, ""A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.' The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. He must increase, but I must decrease."" He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony. Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.",0.485178180038929,21,11,47,24,17,0.18767019,0.1137508,0.061919563,0.061651804000000004,0.060185827000000004,7

As for the vinyl wrapping guy, there's professional grade plastidip options that if put side-by-side next to a vinyl wrapped car, you'd be hard-pressed to tell which is which. Check out AutoFlex coatings, which are insane! Essentially it's sprayable vinyl. It's super glossy like factory paint, and can be treated as such. It costs about the same, lasts about the same, and takes probably a little less time to do since you don't need to take all the panels and whatnot apart (you do spend a good amount of time prepping everything though).

l9qacGzTJXc,"TLDR of why shes calling these foods albanian even though theyre not exclusively so: Basically the ballkans are pretty tiny and have a complicated history so its practically impossible to trace where these foods actually originated, ajvar is a turkish word for example and there is speculation that it is serbian, bosnian or maybe hungarian but nothing actually conclusive, so the serbian claims that is originated in leskovac arent based on any real proof.  However all of the countries there have their own authentic recipies for these foods, so albanian ajvar is different from serbian or bosnian ajvar. So when she says albanian ajvar she means the ajvar made in albania with the albanian recipes which taste quite different from the leskovac ones or whatever else. This is a very common way of refering to these foods in the balkans as each country refers to their own version of the food, and is not a way of claiming the entire thing as their own.",0.2361740954220295,19,25,55,1,22,0.05582968,0.048248503,0.046578903,0.04454099,0.040976017999999996,7

tD5JpHovYMg,"What a beautiful sound she makes!  The low idle setting could be a hang over from the days where they ran the old flathead and just set up as personal preference of the old fella.  I know a lot of guys who loved to get their flatheads idling so low you wonder how they didn't stall - barely reading on the rev counter and all.  I was a bit worried when you took off down the road, thinking to myself ""I hope its not like a lot of other videos where the car has no brakes!""  Awesome vid, Derek - made my night :)   For my money, I'm of two minds for this old girl.  If she was to go back to the road, you might have to put windows in it, a speedometer, seatbelts and all that = let alone lights and indicators and such.  Lights and indicators could be mounted on a bar and bolted on / plugged in when needed for the road and taken off when you got to a show, but having to run safety glass just doesn't fit with the spirit of the old girl.....plus I dont know what your roadworthy regulatory authority would think about the suspension brackets and the lack of fenders.....and changing all that is just not right to me.  Too much.....  But I'd hate to see her be a trailer queen and all.  She was built to race and she should, but as you say, nothing would be gained if the car ended up wrecked.  Maybe get as much info together as you can about her history and trailer the car to local (or wherever) grass-track and dirt track / gravel speedway meets.  Maybe talk to the organisers before the meet, give them her history and how she's a survivor from a bygone age and you'd be happy to take her for a few laps around the track to show the crowd what a REAL old race car can do, while they read out some of the history - especially at any tracks the car was raced on by Luke McLean if any are still going!  Maybe start with them as I reckon they'd be right into it - a bonus celebrity returning to her old stomping ground is a great draw card for the organisers  Gives you some fun, gets the car known / remembered / exercised as she should be and raises the profile of VGG as well.  After the laps, have her parked where people can see her and touch her and get up close with history.  People love seeing historic vehicles that were raced ""back in the day: still belting along at speed and driven in anger nowadays.  It brings them alive and the past lives again.....and you'll find that there will still be some old timers out there who remember her racing and they may have snippets of info to add to your collection on her.   The more I think about it, the more I like that idea.  Seeing her out churning the turf and making beautiful noise with that classic 38 Coupe shape......man it would be a sight.  I'd turn up to watch an historic dirt track beast go out and get dirty like she did in the old days, for sure.....especially if she's raced at the same track we're at long before I was born!",0.4693408831954002,11,48,39,34,63,0.28109458,0.11775672400000001,0.027702376,0.02387309,0.018914111,1

Not as good today, but still not terrible and hopeful that things will get better as the day goes on! It was fun spending time with Salt and Pepper and seeing them react to me being in the water. Obviously I have some work to do with Salt before I can trust her with others in the water, but I figure I have several months before I have to worry about that. I truly think it will be an amazing experience to be able to allow others to swim with her and of course I would always be in the water with them at all times. But for now I cant really worry about that, so much to do between now and then! Hope you all have a great day and remember to be grateful! Every moment I feel more normal I am grateful for and I hope that sometime soon I will feel that way all the time again. I appreciate each of you so much! Love you all!
