It would be coming straight at a right handed batter and he would think he was going to hit him and then it would break over the plate for a strike. Classic #facts\\n Truer words have never been spoken The curve is still exponentially rising with no end in sight. This virus will wipe all of us out. @not alejandro https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/tokyo-governor-tells-residents-to-stay-home-to-avoid-coronavirus-explosion?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15868328473174&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal-development%2F2020%2Fmar%2F26%2Ftokyo-governor-tells-residents-to-stay-home-to-avoid-coronavirus-explosion @Mark Hanson as soon as we stop washing are hands and grabbing are balls. I‚Äôm so sorry to anyone who has lost someone to thisüíô @SeedPlanter - You could be right, but why chance it?  I fear that the worst is yet to come. Delayed cadaver disposal comes with horrific consequences. It\\'s all made up! To just the virus itself and without any pre existing condition or dying of something else already? That would be about 1/4  of the deaths. In other words...this is and never was a pandemic ! some serious stuff I pray for the less unfortunate and those who didn\\'t make it through the virus you know that you know I pray for their family and that they will heal from grieving God is good Poor Fauci, I think he got bullied into pulling back on his statement. Just my opinion btw @Ritchie P. üòÅüòÅüòÅ @Ritchie P. well I enjoyed chatting with you.. have a good night, heading to sleep üòÅ @Ritchie P. lol @Ritchie P. haha..hey at least we had a laugh tonight which is better than the alternative @Ritchie P. no..it was an absolute necessity for you to know the ipsy magic lol..tee hee Not even close to  solving the problem. @ars660 there\\'s 1 coming out by may.but i wont take it. Exactly. It\\'s refreshing to see someone on here has common sense. As a biochemist, I can say we are about 18 MONTHS away from having a \"solution\". The bottom line is everyone is going to come in contact with this virus and if you\\'re in good health it may be best so your body can go ahead and create the antibodies. For those who are vulnerable, we don\\'t have a solution quite yet other than avoiding people. Unfortunately, more people will die. This happens every century. It\\'s part of science. Trump be like: lol there won\\'t be a problem to solve if u all die it\\'s not over yet @Freddy Gibson üòò @Chase Mcdude You are actually braindead. No its just starting in the us. Theres others smaller cities towns and rural areas. @Onan Smith what\\'s wrong with my pic? Chase Mcdude glad u showed herlol SHUT DOWN NY..QUARANTINE THE WHOLE STATE ALREADY!!! @Leesa Lovely i also believe there should be atleast 2 week break every year that would be the real \"earth day\" Kelsey K,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. It\\'s sad...but I\\'m looking at this as the earth cleansing itself. Have you seen the YT videos about how nature is responding to the now quiet streets of generally bustling cities?!? They\\'re  quite telling....\\nHumankind needs to give the earth a break for a full month every year. Kenny Michael Alanya, not in Maryland....I keep trying to figure out where all the people on the roads are going!!!! There\\'s STILL too much traffic! I agree. USA cases is way to high @Copernico Felinis yeah corona is serious i agree with Bill about keeping the school closed as needed @Michael Burke    Michael, this will strengthen you:\\nhttps://youtu.be/YpeU6PcJd_w @Lisa Fleury im only thinking this way Lisa Fleury because im currently in quarentine the last 2 n half weeks with serious respitory problems with nothing remotely like flu symptoms God bless @Michael Burke You are 100% right. @Michael Burke ever hear of coincidence there are plenty that don\\'t have 5g that are getting virus now I\\'m not saying 5g is totally safe but it isn\\'t causing coronavirus  these types of viruses have been around since before even phones look at Spanish flu black plague ect it is just ppl are looking to blame things that they never except the easiest of explanation @Shirley Mccrindle please watch(guy who qiut from installing 5g towers)a fellow american ‚ÄúThank you‚Äùto all first responders,health care workers and all essential workers! I stay home for you guys! Please do not let ur guard down, the virus is still out there spreading @Bryan Rogers thats my fear. Once we reopem things there could be a second outbreak Yup and it‚Äôs not going away anytime soon. They‚Äôre gonna reopen the country at some point but it‚Äôd be such a terrible idea to just get back out there and have it spread all over again Bc it‚Äôll still be out here!! As long as there is ONE case out there nothing is safe. I don‚Äôt know how they are gonna even think of starting up business but they must have an idea of how to handle it I guess. trust that! If true curb flattens at 800 deaths a day, and keeps that number daily, that\\'s not good news! Get rid of that pleage the TRUMPAVIRUS !! @Flashy Paws Thank you so much for this description! You were really smart to keep moving and off your back during the pneumonia part of the ordeal. Good advice for everyone! Thank you. bless fyah    I‚Äôm sorry, there is plenty of that.  But, I care what happens to others .  If no one cared, then why would all of the nurses, doctors,  secretaries and janitors  get up every day and go help people fight a virus that can infect everyone and kills randomly.  Why would the officers try to help citizens by delivering groceries and meds to people at risk? why would the truck driver go out on a route for 2000 miles with very little food and no shelter available to ensure you have food on the table for your children.  People everywhere care and they want to help. They want to know they did something important to contribute. As horrific and sad everything is surrounding this virus, the first thing I see is the care people are giving behind the lines........What about The commander who sacrificed his entire career to help the people he swore to lead and protect.  The nursing assistant who stayed for hours and held the hand of a man she didn‚Äôt even know to calm his fears as he died.  The people of the entire world are at equal risk.  Everyone, all over the world is having to drastically change their life as well as aspects of their entire culture to help save people. We are seeing huge random acts of kindness and bitter corporate enemies joining forces to find answers.  Horrible things are happening. But, this virus is also showing how much people care for others across the world. @Flashy Paws I\\'ll just smoke weed and drink monsters to stay awake when I get it then What happens when everyone comes out?the virus is still there, I guess round two. @Tammy Forbes ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Round 2 of the death plague. @Tammy Forbes keeping distance is not fool proof just stay inside more this year.  The virus can float around especially indoors( elevators are the most dangerous it was how the SARS super spreader infected a entire hotel in 2003) which make social distancing very ineffective. Ya after we open up the economy we\\'ll still have social distancing regulations in place Trayohesuea Vanderbilt nope we know to keep our distance now The dumbest person happens to be one of the the most powerful men on earth. ü§¶\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è You must be talking about Biden! So true. And we know he‚Äôs dumb because he‚Äôs too stupid to even know it. I‚Äôm not sharpest knife in the drawer either but I will tell you exactly what I can‚Äôt do or what my weak areas are. Good Christ Trump is stupid üñï Dr. Fauci: You don\\'t make the timeline, the virus does. These are difficult times that we will have to overcome, amid many problems that the global pandemic has brought us. \\nGood luck to everyone @Janice McKeethanks . When you want, you can see my videos about native\\nplants, by entering the link below\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6nGrhI7-wa-_fKoaJOCnA\\nor click on the name of the channel that will open a list of videos that are available on the channel Thank you, Joel.

When you want, you can see my videos about native plants, by entering the link below\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD6nGrhI7-wa-_fKoaJOCnA goodluck to u too @Joel morales I\\'ll check it out I wouldn\\'t open up until june 1st Jeffrey Witty \\nNew years!üí™üò∑üçª Young Strong Healthy Male \\nNew Year Christ at the earliest and even then it will be gradual and piecemeal. It just takes another wave üåä and then the numbers double schools run here in NY until June 21st so lets make it July 1st. I mean why cover 4 garunteed months of UC benefits for everyone if you\\'re only using half of it? They might wanna keep some harder hit states at 30% capacity until June 1st 500-700 DEATH A DAY.. CURVE FLATTENING?? THE ONLY CURVE FLATTENING ARE THE STOCK MARKET!! @SeedPlanter u do realize it is killing some healthy  young people  too Day death? @SeedPlanter it\\'s not all about you.. there is a reason why they are talking about EVERYONE staying at home, not only sick &/or the elderly bcs you can be healthy & spread the virus to others who then spreds it futher.. you stay home to not risk carrying the infection to others..\\nYou still get infected no matter your age or health status, so you can very possibly still get sick, just not as sick that you\\'ll need a ventilator.. There is still a huge risk that even you can catch this & that you will get more severe symtoms of the infection.. it\\'s not at all that black or white.. and this \"im healthy & young, I\\'m not in risk of cathing it\" - attitude is killing people and just wishful thinking from your part.. sadly the virus dosen\\'t obey your wishful thinking.. @JHOSTIN TOLA And what\\'s the problem? If your not healthy stay home! Us healthy people dont fear this disease because its been proven statisticaly not to be deadly to us! So excuse me .I have to help my country get back to normal. We will let you know when it\\'s safe. Dude...this isnt and never was a pandemic! This is war on your freedom. May the Lord welcome these 10,000 to heaven and comfort their family and friends and keep them healthy and safe. @ARJUN BROOKLYN seeing is believing I guess.  And this fact alone is why the pandemic will continue to exist in USA and I have a feeling USA will be the last country (western world) to have this disease. \\n     I already witness evil itself and it\\'s scary.    What I witness was like a scene out of a horror film but I did deserve it because I did bad things (not life threatening though) @Kenny Michael Alanya I prefer to read my fantastical, mythical, fictional stories through books like Harry Potter, Games of thrones or Marvels Comics. @ARJUN BROOKLYN Psalm 91 actually specifically speaks about Pestilences.\\n  Keep your guard up.  Prayers do work and some DID in fact got better through prayer alone.\\n    But believe what you wish to believe ARJUN BROOKLYN look how it brings people to work together and look out for one another during a time of crisis. Your imaginary deity supposedly has loved to inflict plagues upon humanity since biblical times. New cases and active cases still too high. NBC is censoring comments that go against the official narrative! Why? Look up the word planning. Without widespread testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, it\\'s all wishful thinking, not science. @CC Ryder you could test people morecthan once Einstein. Martin Brodie this what our public ed has produced @CC Ryder Donnie doesn\\'t understand per capita either..lol..sound of dueling banjos!!! You\\'re 100% correct. @CC Ryder pay your mom a little rent and then educate yourself. Money before everything else. What‚Äôs new? You are really selfish because people still need to eat. Only self centered people with food at home would say that. the big buisness are getting most of the stimulus and are going to buy the whole country because people can\\'t afford to keep their piece of the pie. the longer we are waiting the less we can hold on. Its not that cut and dry.. Imagine how many business owners will lose their businesses over this. In areas that arent even really affected. It is not the place of the government to place restrictions on its people. Check out the constitution. \"its just the flu\". If you REALLY felt that way, believed it, and went around spewing it like truth ...YOU. ARE. SHEEP. We need you guys to WAKE UP. Leave them school close before you have more death on your hand especially children Mrs. Jmw Stoooopid @Stacey Mair I work in a high school,  and as of right now in NY, we are closed till the 29th. We don6know what comes after Yep..here in Atlanta schools remain closed for the rest of the school year.. How is the curve flattening!!!!? I‚Äôm legit keeping up with worldometer üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Wtf is going on? üòÇ joe momma this is how I know you‚Äôre too stupid to know anything. Worldometer info is a live update website that links credible resources such as the CDC count of each state and county. You‚Äôre too stupid to know that so I‚Äôll let that pass Do you verify the stories they tell..or just run with the headline of their amazing stories? @edmundo oliver yeah that what I meant... studious thieves. we have a 2K year old temple sculpture depicting that @Fire Ice active total cases continue to rise but the speed at which they are rising is lower. \\n\\nIf there are 5000 new cases per day in 3 weeks then most of the original people today will have been recovered already or have died, lowering the total active cases. \\n\\nI do see your point though. \\n\\nThere are a TONNE of Active cases which are unresolved which will either result in death or recovery. This isn\\'t even close to over Flattening when new cases are the same or lowering.  You have to imagine the graph with the same data points (cases) every day instead of going up, then that\\'s flattening.  It doesn\\'t mean there are no more new cases.  Deaths is a separate curve/graph from confirmed cases. So as long as everyone hides under their bed everything is fine.  Got it. @Jan J I don\\'t drink but that glass of wine doesn\\'t sound bad at all. Jan J, turn up some Eric Benet w that glass of üç∑ and enjoy it.. Kim Sassman - lol. Steven Skaggs - In defense of the new shutins, liquor stores are essential. When you tire of those 4 walls, YouTube and quite possibly those you\\'re trapped w, you\\'ll need a glass of Merlot. @Tani Lee in communist countries. Not here. I don\\'t think. My opinion. The government tracks our every move. Meaning they know how many people are really sick from this virus. Trump: \"The States are on their own\".\\nStates: \"Fine, then don\\'t tell us what we can or can not do\"... @Mark Kountz Who\\'s Will? How did he get into  the conversation? @SeedPlanter As you said: You can\\'t debate with ignorance.\\nAnd I say: Will then stop using your Ignorance as you try to debate. SeedPlanter It\\'s a Very simple question, What has Trump done during his time in the White House?\\nYou can lash out at me as much as you would like, but that doesn\\'t answer the question. @Mark Kountz I cant debate with ignorance. You have to be educated in the subject matter in order for me to properly school you. Ya dig? I can assure you of one thing though. Fear is how they control you and truth is what they fear...Got truth? https://youtu.be/GYX7kR0_ZRI @Almir J√∫nior\" they dont want me they want you\" President Trump...Just the fact that he still stands for our constitution and the people makes him the greatest president since JFK! Period!  He is the only thing that stands between the democratic new world order takeover and our freedom. You will be a slave in your own country and never even realize it! Those who dont move dont see their chains! https://youtu.be/GYX7kR0_ZRI And now I\\'d like to hear again from all those who said the seasonal flu was worse than the \"hoax\" covid19. Over 144 Ameican children died from the flu this year. We have no official Covid only child deaths in America. New York inflated Covid deaths without even positive tests. Get grandma her beer !!! Rules and Laws of God?\\nhttps://youtu.be/oDpMTnIF_M8 I miss the theme intro song. It\\'s so dramatic. Did anyone catch how he said that she said she lost her own life ... meaning The girl that worked at the nursing home Valeria ... how can she say she lost her own life when she‚Äôs dead... smh at the news ... 3:40 Nice chest and tats, A. A - \"The family\" said. \"20 year old said she lost her life a week after getting sick\" what?? Sirena Chantal they must not have a lot of editors in their team üòÇ Kiddinggg Agreed, that was confusing. It sounded like she spoke after she died. Poorly written! @Old Account I think you missed the point.  The article says her family said it.  \"20 year old said she lost her life a week after getting sick\" It‚Äôs true! I‚Äôm from Riverside. There‚Äôs a press enterprise article about it. https://www.pe.com/2020/04/13/woman-20-who-worked-at-riverside-nursing-home-with-outbreak-dies-from-coronavirus/amp/ LOL.  Maybe fake news.  Maybe not. Freedom isn\\'t free it is actually about 2.2 trillion dollars and your grandpa üõÇüöØüé≠üëª Welp.  Guess that means this virus will stay with us for awhileüòì Your grandpa not mine. the president thinks he\\'s god ü§¶\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è Aangel Phillips what would you do if you were President? He is in a no win situation. He will get blamed for deaths or he will get blamed for the bad economy. Just admit that no matter what he does you people would never be happy!!! So when it was time to shut everything down, it was the states‚Äô decision; when it comes to reopening its Trump‚Äôs decision? Guess who owns Smithfield  China. @Janice McKee lol smh The Chinese do love their pork. Domestically, their pigs are quickly dying off. Seems like it\\'s one scourge after another for China. @Di&Ce -  Everyone needs to take care of their own pork belly. According to health experts, a pork belly has a limited future. Janice McKee invest in pork belly futures. Stands to reason. Pork is a favored meat in China and their own livestock has been rapidly dying. We democrats need to VOTE in November to ‚Äúchange the channel.‚Äù Boom! the virus will disappear like a miracle! Bang! the sound of economy collapsing and not coming back! This is going to start all over again if they open on may 1...be ready This sucks I agree with governor Cuomo \\'s advice good idea to close schools and helping to flattening the curve It\\'s important to our sense of peace to have our children close, and children certainly need their parents right now. Cuomo told DeBlasio that he can\\'t decide that Schools will stay closed on his own....but Cuomo can\\'t make the call on when it would be safe and functional to be able to open. Stay positive and Stay Healthy. It\\'s over restart the economy now, enough with this drama Curve flattening? But everyday you have 30000 more new cases, how is that flattening the curve? For one thing, people are dying so fast I guess they are not running out of respirators like they had expected to do. @joann Loves CountryLife You must be getting your \"news\" from Fox-the-fake-news-channel and/or from conspiracy theorists. I\\'ve heard no \"experts\" saying that Covid-19 is lab created. It\\'s just people like yourself who I\\'ve seen claiming such things. Covid-19 supposedly originated in bats and possibly moved into civet cats and then to humans, was what I heard \"experts\" saying.\\n\\nThe problem with any new virus is that people have never encountered it and thus have no immunity to it. Or so it\\'s believed. It was previously thought that humans had no immunity to diseases such as the Black Plague of centuries past, nor to HIV/Aids, which sprang up with a vengeance in the 1980s. But it turns out that a few people DID possess immunity for some reason, even to HIV/AIDS.\\n\\nMaybe immunity is the reason that Covid-19 produces no symptoms in some people, mild symptoms in others, and a more severe disease in others. And why for a percentage of people, including otherwise healthy people, Covid-19 causes death. Maybe those with severe illness from Covid-19 have no immunity to it, while others may have something that gives them the ability to avoid some or all of the symptoms of the disease.\\n\\nI may have caught Covid-19 a few weeks ago but there were no tests being done, so who knows. For several days, I had fever, a sore throat, and a dry cough, with symptoms being sporadic. I had a headache at times and one day of cold-like symptoms (a runny nose) and a very bad cough that day, which prevented me from being able to talk for a while. After several more days, I felt OK but now, weeks later, my asthma seems a little worse than normal.\\n\\nWas it Covid-19? Who knows, without testing. But I had only one day of feeling really bad and it was NOT a cold, so I HOPE it was Covid-19 and I breezed through it. Hopefully I now have immunity, but there is no way to know because they are not doing enough testing, dammit. And its also not clear whether having the virus produces immunity or not. @Shie H. cases are stabilizing because test is limited.you can test that many, you get that many cases. @Synthia Pyre that\\'s their only defense @Synthia Pyre that is their only defense More curve flattening BS I will lay the money down for a front row seat to the first sporting event to return to my town!  AMERICA STRONG! Everyone is paying a price including the school children, I am sure they can make it up with some extra time!! \"someone ate a bat and now i\\'m unemployed.\" - 2020 It is starting to be admitted this virus was bioengineered.

I need another beer...... @Leudwig vonshwartsenhelm The thought process here is probably \"Can\\'t die from COVID19 if I die of liver failure first!\" Save some beer,  the supplies are gonna be short soon Have one for me please So do I, but you should know that alcohol weakens your immune system....... do you? im in Love how the Dr. neatly sidesteps Bozobrain.

Jesus called it a great tribulation that had never occurred since the world\\'s beginning. (Matthew 24:21) One of those freedoms that will go away will be religion when it subjected to a systemic attack by the world\\'s governments, including the United States. (Revelation 17:16) Agree..goodbye freefom 2:06 He looks like an enlightened being. the tonkin war was based on lies \\nthe war in iraq was based on lies\\n911 was done by our government \\nwho do we trust.\\nthey lied about weapon of mass destruction in iraq. media is always lying. who do we trust?\\n they spray chemtrails in the skies for us to breathe in.... who do we believe? leaders only wanr to protect their position Government Power Grab !\\nExplained By Politics !\\nMitigation ! There is confirmed cases in every state ‚ÄºÔ∏èüò¢‚ÄºÔ∏è Thank you everyone in the world staying at home do all the pre-caution all measure to fight this virus. The worse is not over. MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING. THIS SHOULD BE THE FOCUS. HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS? @Vox Seven how? @The Blue Wave more then you can ever know.  He is. God isnt helping. Oh my God the sky is falling the sky is falling. I know it‚Äôs TRUE I heard on the news Keep all those beds and vents ready for 2nd wave once the country starts moving around. Get the PPE stocked up \\nNEVER AGAIN!! Dr. Fauci please stay strong, take good care of yourself. After this calamity, I am sure everybody will withdraw their money at the bank. Recession is inevitable. 2 more weeks and we should go back to work. I need to go to with even with a mask and glove are fine Hard to imagine the number is only the 1% of the whole picture Bare down for the Long haul keep pushing....I will pray....we can do this... That ICU nurse is very cute and sweet though. The planet hates us right now, but we aren\\'t helping by not having uniform closures nationwide. @ 3:38, Sincerest Condolences to the parents of the 20-year old nursing home employee. i saw a comment from somebody who said that he has a friend that\\'s a EMT\\n\\nand his friend told him that they was told to not take really sick people that they suspected had the virus to the hospital\\n\\nand instead tell them that they should stay at home\\n\\nto keep the peak from rising, and so they could make everybody think that the peak leveled off\\n\\nand i don\\'t see why that guy would lie about something like that\\n\\nand it seems like he told the truth to, because just recently they just said that there was a bunch of people who died in their homes, that they think was because of COVID 19\\n\\nwhich is why they just added a lot more deaths to their tested numbers\\n\\nthis is why i suspect that the curve is very misleading Wait a minute trying to work with maskes Al day 8 hours wat happens when you sweat and slips down or off  so your not all safe  to work I rather wait out for the cure . People help me out here  should we fight trump on this we think about our lives and family trump wants money to line his pockets. Sending you in the line of üî• üî• your replies lies Keeping up the scaremongering agenda!!!! 10 effing THOUSAND!!! In one state!! Im glad to hear curve is flattening and hoping it will go down as cases go down soon. Lol.  It\\'s not * not tested and admitted I hope so too. But don\\'t be too optimistic about it. People with heavy symptoms are dying, people with mild symptoms are tested and admitted. Also, most people are staying at home. Thus the number will go down temporarily. The virus is within the population, and virus can mutate. If they did mutate, we will looking at second wave coming at us, even the ones who has recovered might get re-infected. Get ready for your forced traceable vaccine Amin! In order to restart things, high risk older people will still need to stay at home so get used to it. This is a very dangerous virus with long term consequences. The Navy sailor that died was part of the NJ National Guard and an \"older crew member\" Looks like Fauci was forced to retract his statement on behalf of the president. Why is that not surprising To the grandmother from Pittsburgh. Ma‚Äôam I would gladly buy you a 12 pack 1:36  I think is tragic, but is she smilling? 10k in New York City, or New York State? can the news be more specific for those who think New York is just a city? We need Fauci, without him it would be 100% circus.  Thank you Dr for eating your true words.   you sacrificed your integrity for the sanity of the USA.  All if forgiven Sara before you praise Fauci you need to study his back ground.  He is the wizard behind the curtain playing Trump like a piano. While w0nderfully hungry, I am reminded of the need to \"make America super healthy\" (mAsh) **now** so that the next wave(s) of this pandemic won\\'t be even more devastating. Saw this!!!! Stop it. The curve is not flattening. \\n\\n1.) ICU beds are down because they‚Äôre dying \\n2.) reporting of cases is down because they have literally stopped testing people Shahin thank you for pointing it out! A good economy is no good if you‚Äôre dead! Do ya research and go look in these streets. Aww I like how a 90 year old Korean Veteran got a nice Birthday Curve not flattening\\nJust federal funding for testing was stopped this week what !!? They killing ppl This is so crazy yet we still dont have a solution get those patients and NURSES some help The CV task force briefing atmosphere was amicable. POTUS said to leave gov decision as when or whether re-open their states. Media likes to be sensational and flaming.ü§î I am not the nurse ‚Äú but I would like to go there to helping anything If I can Lisa Dao - Bless your sweet soul!  You must be self protective first.\\nChecking in on a neighbor or two will be deeply appreciated  at this time. Many of our elderly folks are lonesome,\\n frightened,  and would find comfort in a phone call or a wave from across the street. Pull together people to do your part, as a world we should tow the load together. Put aside differences, for grems have no sides. How do you know the curb is flattening when we\\'re only testing less that 1% of the population? ',\n",

What idea of mankind? None, there is nothing but blabberry from a woman rised by a american good and migthy kool aid, a true patriot the same people she said was figthing. Biggest sellout, thats why the sorrow always smile This is the second timeline. Isaac Elhav no, it‚Äôs like if Kojima removed all the story from the series, then cranked those what the fuck moments to the max It\\'s amazing how a Japanese dev, an outsider, managed to capture all the complex intricacies of American patriotism. @Dripik shut up @Dripik amen There also this manga called \"billy bat\" and it captured the american history perfectly.

Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, This is what Donald Trump watches every morning to get himself motivated for work. @Echo SD oh my god I heard it in his voice I can just picture him, looking himself in the mirror, pointing, and saying over and over again \"You\\'re the president of the great United States of America!\" I love how the voice actors are not taking their jobs seriously once so ever. Makes the game 10 times better. The girl just doesn‚Äôt give a fucc, while the VA for the President is trying way too hard and the contrast is hilarious I like how they\\'re clearly reading all the lines on the screen separately. I think just like EDF, japanese version is pretty serious. I like that despite how evil Richard is, he sounds a little clueless and very goofy. \"I\\'ll hug you to death!\" The most American game ever made is made by Japanese people \\nWho are also the same Japanese people who made dark souls \\n I love this world fromsoftwares magnum opus, for sure To everyone not living in America:\\n\\nThis is exactly what happens everyday.

This is set roughly 2000 years after the events of Dark Souls 3, in this timeline the ashen one became the president of the united states. I remember when I stopped by Grand Canyon here in Florida because I had to do a recount and an attack helicopter piloted by an alligator started attacking and the President of the United States drop kicked it out the sky and saved my Publix chicken tender sub but sadly I lost count and accidentally elected Richard as VP, sorry guys. At least you saved the chicken tender sub. It\\'s the most desired item here. Happens to the best of us To non-Americans, this looks awful.

When dunkey laughs this hard on a videogame\\n\\n\\nYou know is gonna be on his top ten of the year I like how much this feels like a Devolver Digital game even though it was originally developed by From Software, A.K.A. the Darks Souls people @Kevin I know. I\\'m just saying they dont seem like they were made by the same studio You know Dark Souls came out 7 years after this game . Yeah and the rerelease was published by devolver Thanks! As a European, I always wondered what America was like. Very Educational! It\\'s not entirely accurate. Our water has far less reflections than that. That water was too realistic. As a Canadian, I will now live in constant terror for our landmarks and giant robots. @The Man Emperor of Mankind Ah yes. The Alcatraz Canon. One of my most fondly remembered orchestral pieces. I remember buying the CD for it. Still have it to this very day. It was all covered in dust at the back of the rack, and the expiration date was still good. It\\'s actually INaccurate. There isn\\'t a single school shooting or tide-pod eating zoomer in sight. Dolphin H \\nJust the other day Michael flew over my house in his mech suit and blew up Richard again. It was cool the first 270 times, but now I hardly notice it.

I love the delivery on the \"Hello Michael, how\\'s life treating you\".\\nHe sounds like he\\'s the kinda man that could cause allot of damage, saw a boat in half and sell me the tape to fix it all. Every time he says \"AND THE REASON IS...\" I know I\\'m about to be on the ground laughing dog Of course the antagonist is the Vice President. The only country strong enough to fight America... *is AMERICA* @Furry Destroyer haha, the tyrannical government was definitely South Vietnam. Ngo Dinh Diem was an absolute bastard and a tyrant, but the USA propped him up because he was anti-communist. Even after he was assassinated by his own generals, the South Vietnamese government continued to grow more corrupt and tyrannical every year. If there was a single \"bad guy\" of the entire war, it was the government of South Vietnam. @T·ª´ Duy Ng·ªç \\nThey invaded to help the Southern Vietnamese who were fighting against a tyrannical government. The civillian losses were due to the Vietcong\\'s shitty tactics of dressing up as civillians which confused Amercian soldiers into who was or wasn\\'t a Vietcong soldier. @Furry Destroyer an invading army killing millions innocent civilians. I see what\\'s you\\'re proud of. Is that how American \"perform justice, spread freedom and protect human rights\"? well obviously, just look at the current administration. @Mr Obscene The fact that your country lost a war to Vietnamese farmers? Easily one of the best videos on the entire internet right now. So what if it\\'s been posted months ago, very relevant game right here. A gem.

The sexual tension between Michael and Richard really tied this story together! I gotta find the voice actor and give *him* the Medal of Honor 4:58 Mario: \"So long, Gay Bowser!\" 2:07 my opponents in super smash bros. be like: The president: Video games cause violence\\n\\nAlso the president: Yeah, blowing up cable cars in San Fran that is the symbol of this great American city. He\\'s trying to hide his identity as *The President of the great United States.* Soon his identity will be revealed & he will liberate us all by declaring war on the US military in a mech suit. @Floshjix02 he said it a year ago after parkland and again a month ago after the mass shootings I dont remember him saying that perhaps we should send him a copy of this game :P might change his mind. I need an hbo series 10 seasons based just off this dialogue ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the president of the great United States of America‚Äù - Michael\\n‚ÄúAny man who must say ‚ÄôI am the king‚Äô is no true king‚Äù - Tywin Lannister I can\\'t believe this is from the same people that made Dark Souls \"AHH RICHAAAAARD!\"\\n\\n\"MICHAAEEEL!

As an actual American, I can confirm this happens to every president, it has been a ancient tradition to around the time of the Florida Recount I thought this was a fever dream till I found the video again.

The Republicans keep blocking them. @JSD Puerto Rico doesn\\'t pay taxes except programs like Medicare @JSD They pay very few US federal taxes, such as import duties. They do not pay income tax, which is the bulk of US tax burden. Also I do not see how that isn\\'t the point. They can vote themselves representation at any time, or vote themselves independence at any time. They choose to avoid both financial and electoral  participation while enjoying US protection. @Dan Sands That\\'s not the point. The Falklands are a UK territory, and voted to remain as such, they don\\'t pay UK taxes. Likewise the problem with Puerto Rico is not that they can\\'t vote, it\\'s that they can\\'t vote AND they pay taxes. It\\'s taxation without representation, which the US claims to oppose @JSD Puerto Ricans are free to vote for independence or statehood whenever they wish, and have, several times. They choose to remain a territory. i love how like it‚Äôs definitely illegal they just can‚Äôt like do anything. it‚Äôs like saying to a cop ‚Äú nah‚Äù and driving away There‚Äôs no way to avoid the fee if you‚Äôre a diplomat, they‚Äôre pretty much taxing their job @Gods Bloody Hammer At least I didn\\'t get Rick Rolled. What\\'s fun is how the NYPD handle traffic tickets and illegal parking in NYC when the UN diplomats start getting too bad with it.  They just start towing all the cars. @Gods Bloody Hammer no u @Gods Bloody Hammer funny joke lmao Like the US diplomat whose wife killed a teenager here in the Uk last year by wreck less driving and scurried back to the US and claimed she had ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù... Imagine walking away from a mass shooting with your diplomatic passport. They do have immunity every diplomat does üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ @Abcde Fghij Please, do not feed the troll. Bruh, that reminds me of the story of the Canadian diplomat‚Äôs 14-16 year old son who lied to her about going to the movie theater with his little brother, and instead, had his little brother hop into the driver‚Äôs seat of their mom‚Äôs car (which had the consulate plates on it) and had him drive up to a drug dealer‚Äôs apartment. The dude then hopped out, ran up the stairs, and then runs out five minutes later covered in blood and gunshot wounds with a pistol in his hand, yelling at his horribly terrified and traumatized brother to drive as fucking fast a possible. I think the teen died from blood loss, but I can‚Äôt remember. This was like three years ago here in Florida. Think the guy purposely took the consulate car to claim diplomatic immunity if he was caught. To be fair the us doesnt waive  it because the like her, they do it to prevent a precedence, that would make diplomatic  immunity useless. \"Simp tax, which is what a premium Snapchat subscription is called\"\\n\\nMy lungsss üòÇ @Francisco Manuel S√°nchez Rubio S I M P @??????

One of my favorite podcasts as I was getting started, you always get such awesome guests \"it\\'s like charging someone for basic healthcare!\"\\n\\n\\nWe Americans be like:\\n\\nUncool. More like, we pay for better specialist care. @Guardian dude.uncool Yup, There‚Äôs a tax for that \"Who would make you pay for basic healthcare\"\\n*Cries in American* @M B Damn, you must be really rich to pay this much taxes. Perturabo you are but it‚Äôs cheaper @Dan Sands Indeed, private sector doctors do get paid more than public ones, and usually have better work benefits as well. In addition to that, the private health care provider takes a premium for providing the service. That\\'s the whole reason to be a private entity after all. The public doesn\\'t have that cost at all, and it\\'s exactly that profit margin that private companies usually have to deduce from to compete with prepaid health care. Meaning that the consumer has a better deal all in all. A person in the US just paid 10k for a Covid test in the US. That would never happen in a universal health care country. Never. @Matti This may surprise you to hear, but healthcare professionals are fairly well paid. Healthcare professionals with the experience and skill to work at private providers much more so. Keeping prices of private care low enough to compete with free healthcare is largely pointless, so they rely on patients who don\\'t have financial considerations. I challenge you to sell an ¬£800 blood test to anyone besides an oil baron. @Dan Sands That\\'s literally a price competitive edge when you can offer something that has been already paid for vs expensive. The  private health care provider does not only have to provide a good service, but also a. service that is not *so* expensive as to make others reconsider and remain with the public health care provider.\\n\\nThe gap between price and quality/attainability of service has to maintain a reasonable distance, or otherwise people will stay with the public option.  In a well managed public system attainability is moderated based on need and to a degree price, and quality is good. In a well managed  private service attainability is moderated by price and quality really heavily depends on price as well. The public option is still a price. competitor, price is just not the only factor in the equation. I live in DC and diplomats always break traffic laws, it\\'s really annoying @Gods Bloody Hammer nobody asked Gods Bloody Hammer The US? The US never conquered/taxed India like the British did.

Well, as it stands only Sweden has paid the USA back for both lend-lease & post WW2 aid.  So the Brits could just deduct it from what they owe the USA from the 1940s. Pretty sure the UK made their final repayment in 2006. This problem exists in every city around the world with embassies.

Also more on the military. Also more on foreign aid. There\\'s a trend here. We\\'re the wealthiest country in the world by light years, and it\\'s because, among other reasons, we don\\'t flush our money down the toilet having the government provide healthcare. This came up in my recommended feed..\\n\\n..of Soundcloud\\'s thiccest hiphop lyrics of 2020. Unlike Byron Russel, I enjoyed the crossover. the solution..: hire some diplomats of another country to torture those us diplomats as long as needed for them to cough up the money.  or have the uk diplimats in the us just rob a bank.. also immune so also get their 13 mil.\\n\\nBut a more hilarious method can also be used : \\nwall in that ambasade.. just make it so nobody can enter or leave it.. the ambasade itself is us soil.. but building a wall on all sides around it is totally legal.\\nthey could ofcourse still fly in, but a simple no fly zone around the ambassy with a few automated ground to air missiles.. would do the trick nicely. yes one cannot procecute ambassadors.. but firing down an object that is illigally in a certain zone.. near an us ambasade.. \\n the vienna convention gives the host state the DUTY to protect the ambassy against ALL intrusions.. and NO obligation to give acces to the land or air around it..\\n\\nthat way the us ambassadors are effectively but legally imprisosed in their own ambassy.. ofcourse we are willing to remove the wall.. but we\\'ll charge 13 million for that to be paid upfront. what if instead of saying they \"died\", what if he said \"dieded\" \"Simp Tax\"\\nHmmm....

Instead it just feels like it was inappropriate timing. As soon as you mentioned the Congestion Charge I knew where you\\'d be going with this video, but the beautiful wordplay at the start more than makes up for it üòÅ \"It\\'s like charging people for healthcare\"\\nI got that At the beginning you showed Ireland as part of the uk.

FYI, The flag you used as \"London\" is actually the flag for the City of London, 2 completley different things. Whilst the Congestion Charge is in the City of London, the majority of it is just in London. London, surprisingly enough, doesn\\'t have a flag. 4:41 - What did you search for to find that stock footage? \"Man in suit thrusting\"?

His name was Harry Dunn. Look it up. The diplomats wife killed a U.K. citizen by driving on the wrong side of the road. Look it up \"Why would someone charge for healthcare?\"\\nAsking that question to the united states @Matti I\\'m a strong critic of the military and police. Their existence isn\\'t inherently violent except to the extent that they\\'re funded by theft. However, when they\\'re used to inflict violence, I believe that violence needs to be justified by a worse threat of violence, the same way a civilian would have to justify use of violence in self defense. If someone threatens to shoot me and I\\'ve done nothing wrong, I can shoot them in self defense. I can\\'t shoot them because they\\'ve decided to contribute to society by working, yet they refuse to pay my medical bills. @timewave02012 So are you against all taxes?\\nAlso I\\'d like to point out that the police and the military are government/state violence @Matti If it\\'s so great, let it be voluntary. I\\'m not against healthcare. I\\'m against government violence. @timewave02012 The doctors in countries with universal health care get paid still way above the average citizen, so it\\'s a pretty fair deal for them. On the other hand, having universal coverage saves a lot of lives and provides a more effective work force, since workers are healthier, and also creates entrepreneurial opportunity, since the pressure on an individual to try and create new business is smaller because failure is much less dangerous. @admhou1 What\\'s the average, or even better the median, tax rate in the UK? I can give you a hint: not over 50% During the first 30 seconds I thought I was watching a CGP Grey video Are you my dad \"Simp Tax\"\\nI\\'m dead New York City is also planning on starting surge pricing in a few years so I wonder if diplomats there will have to pay the fee Provided, \\'ed\\' is HAI\\'s most favourite ending of every word. Undoubted. üòÇüòÇüòÇ The Department of Public Prosecution recently ruled that the wife of a US diplomat who killed a young man in a traffic accident didn‚Äôt have diplomatic immunity at the time. Interesting times in diplomatic relations in London. When I saw this, I thought it  was going to be all about Parking Tickets, and it wasnt but also it was...sorta. Fun fact US has the largest debt about \\'21\\' trillion dollars However, around $14-$19 trillion dollars comes from the government itself. The rest is foreign debt. It\\'s not the largest as a percentage of GDP Majority of that debt is to the US government, the fed, and US investors who have bought into the bond market. @Yellow Penguin lol Actually, $26,743,153,951,328 give or take, but it\\'ll be more by the time you read this.

Seriously? @Supper Soup Your attempt to justify your initial post is admirable, however, your logic, and apparently your understanding of basic grammatical concepts, is inherently flawed. Breaking down your hastily slapped together response, My understanding of your main points is that:\\nA)Trump took more than one initial action to curb the looming threat of COVID-19\\nB)Democrats told Trump not to enact a travel ban on China.\\nC)Hillary said Trump shouldn\\'t have enacted the travel ban so soon.\\nD)If Hillary was president we\\'d be in \"big trouble\" right now.\\n\\nGiven that we are discussing the adequacy (or lack thereof) of Trump\\'s response to the coronavirus:\\n-Point A makes a claim without providing evidence and therefore renders it Useless with regards to your argument.\\n-Point B is irrelevant as we are examining the adequacy of Trump\\'s actions, not the suggestions given to him by members of the apposing political party.\\n-Point C is irrelevant for the reason stated previously.\\n-Point D is irrelevant as we are examining the adequacy of Trump\\'s Actions, not a hypothetical situation in which Hillary was president. \\n\\nKey Takeaways:\\n-Point A could be used as an effective argument, but you failed to back up your claim with evidence, which makes it\\'s credibility nonexistent.\\n-Points B through D are irrelevant to your argument. This means that even if you were to somehow prove those points to be valid, they would do nothing to further your argument. \\n\\nGrammatical Issues:\\n-\"Not reading all that, You sound like my dad who writes paragraphs for no reason lol not to be rude.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"I\\'m not reading all that. Not to be rude, but you sound like my dad. He writes paragraphs for no reason.\"\\n-\"He took more than one action, lmao.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"He took more than one action.\"\\n-\"Imagine if a democrat person told trump to be even sooner.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: I have no idea how to translate that gibberish honestly.\\n-\"even tho all the democratic \\'recognizable people\\' told him he shouldn\\'t close the way too china.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"Even though the Democrat leaders told him not to enact a travel ban on China.\"\\n-\"thatd be funny.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"That would be Humorous.\"\\n-\"Hilary said trump shouldnt of even closed it that soon, lol.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"Hillary said Trump shouldn\\'t have enacted the travel ban so soon.\"\\n-\"imagine if Hilary was president, we\\'d be in big trouble right now.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"Imagine if Hillary was president; we would be in big trouble right now.\"\\n\\nNotes:\\nOverall, your argument was exceedingly weak. The only point you made which had any bearing whatsoever on the topic being discussed was Point A, and the lack of supporting evidence for your claim made that point just as useless as your other ones. If you wish to attempt to have even the most basic level of discourse with someone who you disagree with, I would recommend reading their statement fully before attempting to respond. The train wreck of a comment you decided to impose upon the eyes of the innocent people browsing these comments is a perfect example what happens when you attempt to argue with someone and have no idea what their argument is and/or what you\\'re talking about. Going forward I would recommend that you spend more time with your father. It\\'s a massive stretch, but perhaps his love of writing long paragraphs for no reason could be used to teach you some minute semblance of an understanding of the English language and the grammatical concepts associated with it. @Miles Miller Hughes why because Bernie is a punk azz sell out & Biden is worser than Trump..üñï Miles Miller Hughes Not reading all that, You sound like my dad who writes paragraphs for no reason lol not to be rude. He took more than one action, lmao. Imagine if a democrat person told trump to be even sooner. even tho all the democratic ‚Äúrecognizable people‚Äù told him he shouldnt even close the way too china. thatd be funny. Hilary said trump shouldnt of even closed it that soon, lol imagine if Hilary was president, we‚Äôd be in big trouble right now. @Supper Soup Yeah... he placed a travel ban on china... That\\'s it. Now we\\'re number 1 in the world for total coronavirus cases (614,246 cases) and deaths (28,300 deaths). By the end of today, that number will undoubtedly be greater than 30,000. To put that in perspective for you, that\\'s more than ten times the number of people that were killed as a result of 911. Leading statistical models project the final death toll in the US to be anywhere from 60,000 to 240,000. Meanwhile, instead of taking further action to halt the spread of the virus, which is disproportionately affecting low income communities (specifically low income black communities), our stable genius of a president is hosting press conferences in an attempt minimize the perceived severity of the situation which I can guarantee you is causing the chromosome-deficient homunculi he calls followers to not take this situation seriously. Normally I would consider the fact that Cletus and Larry want to expose their meth-riddled lungs to the coronavirus to be a net gain for the gene pool, however, by doing this they are only putting the people who are already risking their lives to try and save people at even more risk. But yeah... thank god he took action before it got to the US. @Tray Day 216  Friendly Suggestion: Delete everything you\\'ve ever posted on the internet, acquire a basic understanding of the English language, and try again. Forget Trump\\'s white house and find your information from other sources. C D , trump is literally running out of people to blame for the coronavirus outbreak in the United States.

I\\'m guessing some guileless profiteering is being planned by selling gold-plated, wildly price-inflated ventilators to suffering countries. The _onset index_ case for this virus was reported on *November 29, 2019* in China: the earliest confirmed mediatic reports and papers from China (which were subsequently squelched and destroyed) started in *early December.* https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global Shows one of the earliest, verified sequence dates between *_12/10/19_* and *_12/12/19_* for China; with an inferred date on *_12/10/19,_* which aligns nearly perfectly with the suggested late November onset date for the most severe cases.  The identified hospital admission, likely index case, and RT-PCR test on *Dec. 10-11th* was that of *Wei Guixian.*  https://www.axios.com/timeline-the-early-days-of-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak-and-cover-up-ee65211a-afb6-4641-97b8-353718a5faab.html\\r\\nThis could mean upwards of hundreds of millions of recovered and uncounted cases because the first *_-Worldometer-_* reported test for China was on January 22nd (highly dubious) and on Jan. 21st for the U.S. (possibly true as it is fully consistent with the data) respectively. It\\'s also why mortality rates will always look highly-inflated worldwide because China did not start counting suspected cases via RT-PCR machine on Dec. 10th with *Ms. Guixian* and those she had contact with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is where China\\'s *_scrubbing campaign_* and _bait-and-switch_ will go into overdrive and will be used to blame the United States or other Western nations for COVID\\'s reemergence.  China seems to scrub their past data as we go along so we can\\'t get a very accurate gauge of where they\\'ve been.  This means that, for China, they only started reporting positive tests a *month and a half* or so after they had COVID sequenced via an RT-PCR machine in a forensics or bio-lab (when the lab itself could have been used to confirm more samples until fully accurate, portable tests were developed).  Failed national containment and a potential accidental/purposeful release from the lab... but with a twist that it is likely not as bad as we originally thought or expected.  See below for proof (especially the antibody section).\\r\\n*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\\r\\nSmoking is barely in the narrative when it can cause pulmonary fibrosis, which is one of the primary causative factors leading to death with this disease (imagine being a 40-year smoker and getting this).  Life expectancy and average age of death or level/interaction of a very serious complication is not in the narrative.  Level of and amount of comorbidities of those dying is not in the narrative.  Age cohorts not changing in terms of statistical death rate over time since they came out of China, not even by a fraction of a percent... and even Worldometers is now reporting that 1 in 10, minimum, cases are under-counted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A study by disease modelers at the University of Texas at Austin states that \\'Given the low testing rates throughout the country, we assume that 1 in 10 cases are tested and reported. If a county has detected only 1 case of COVID-19, there is a 51% chance that there is already a growing outbreak underway\\' \"- April 6th\\r\\nhttps://cid.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/cid/files/covid-risk-maps_counties_4.3.2020.pdf?m=1585958755\\r\\n*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\\r\\n\"A study by the University of Bonn tested a *_randomized sample_* of 1,000 residents of the town of Gangelt and found that 2% of the population was currently infected and 14% were carrying antibodies suggesting that they had already been infected - whether or not they experienced any symptoms. The team concluded that 15% of the town were infected at some point with the virus.\" - April 10th\\r\\nhttps://spectator.us/covid-antibody-test-german-town-shows-15-percent-infection-rate/\\r\\nWe see also that, while Gangelt is in Heinsberg, and that Heinsberg is indeed one of the most infected spots, *only .615%* of the entire population of the district of Heinsberg is currently tested as infected.  Additionally, only *4.65% [12,446/254,322]* of the population of Heinsberg lives in Gangelt... further solidifying this theory.\\r\\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?layers=917fc37a709542548cc3be077a786c17\\r\\nBy consequence, we cannot explain the discrepancy of *randomly selected, positive antibody tests* as a percentage this high (15%) in the town of Gangelt vs. the current tested (.615%) for the entire district of Heinsberg, unless this virus was in the population for quite some time (much earlier in February [possibly into mid-January] than the reported 25th).  \\r\\n\\r\\nJust to make sure I wasn\\'t being mislead by the above links, I found the link to Heisenberg\\'s population (it\\'s also a city, I\\'m talking about the district).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinsberg_(district) The Heisenberg\\'s case count of 1564... https://www.ovulation-calculators.com/coronavirus/de/heinsberg/ and it directly matches the link above these two in terms of returning .615% infected for the entire district.  A further confirmation that this testing could have proven something *_vital,_* as the small town in question of Gangelt only has 4.65% of Heinsberg\\'s total population, yet 15% are already immune a little over a month into Germany\\'s pandemic.\\r\\n*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\\r\\n\"Most deaths have been among the elderly. Figures released by NHS England show more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80.\"  Average age of life expectancy in the U.K. is 80. - April 12th\\r\\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51768274\\r\\nAnother thing to note about the fact that elderly are just now getting it in large numbers is that they\\'d be less likely to be exposed to it if it was in the population before it was noticed by the mainstream.  They travel less and have less social interaction than the youth to begin with [especially during winter], so they would have a much lower chance of contracting it until it truly picked up steam in the asymptomatic/mild population (which incidentally would be about the time the elderly started prepping since they move a bit on a lag due to age and news sources).\\r\\n*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\\r\\nAnother quote of note from Chinese Researchers, local citizens of Wuhan, and tourists themselves is that *\"according to municipal reports and the testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors, the bat was never a source of food in the city, and no bat was traded on the market.\"* This leads us to question whether this virus was accidentally released from the lab (which is quite possible if you fail to follow _doffing_ and _decontamination_ protocol to a T.), or purposely released by a psychopath or team of psychopaths that were subsequently quashed.  The natural host reservoir of the virus is in horseshoe bats over 500 miles away from the market in question. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frx3YjMT1_I\\r\\n\\r\\n*_A final, anonymous quote:_*\\r\\n_\\'They (China) are admitting that it \"came out\" of the Wuhan lab because people are starting to realize that this is not a \"super virus\": in particular because the natural host reservoir contains 30 coronaviruses and some of them have likely ran their course through the human population at some point.  This likely would have conferred some level of immunity because this coronavirus is a sub-species of Sars-1 and a few other (perhaps unnoticeable in humans, but still transferable) coronaviruses... which could have also played a role in immunity because a large portion of us could have already processed some instance of _*_a_*_ coronavirus and thus built up our immune systems in the past.  These could even apply on the genetic level depending on how old coronaviruses are as a clade and how they shaped our evolutionary history.  These genetic immunity postulations are independent from where and when we account for the lag in knowing the true index case as initially postulated when we opened above, which, in turn, inflates the _*_actual case and recovered numbers_*_ exponentially without the aforementioned considerations of potential genetic immunity if the index case is indeed revised.  The nice consolation price is that if there is built-in evolutionary immunity, it wouldn\\'t be race specific._\\r\\n_The media and the doctors were telling everyone that this was worse than Aids.  But now we know that it\\'s a weak virus.  That it can be k!lled or prevented with vitamin A, D, C, Zinc, antibiotics, and Hydroxychloroquine.  That cases are being lag-reported under the \"recovered\" stat to inflate the active case mortality rate.  That the ventilators are causing patients to die in some cases through _*_increased pneumonia via VAP_*_ or other _*_ventilator/iatrogenic causes._*_  That Medicare pays hospitals $13,000 for every \"case\" of the virus, and $39,000 for every patient that\\'s put on a ventilator.  That the infected with the virus don\\'t need a ventilator in most cases, but what they really need is oxygen in most cases.  That anybody that dies \"with\" the virus, is registered as if they died \"from\" the virus.  That\\'s why the narrative coming out of MSM is changing.  They got caught, or at least they believe it.  Politicians are involved in this \"conspiracy\".  A conspiracy of blowing all of this out of proportion for personal political and economic gain.  They are trying to change the narrative to cover their tracks.  That\\'s how it looks like to me.\\'_\\r\\n*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*\\r\\nWe are losing informed consent and our economy.  We are doing grave damage to our social psyche and societal health without waiting for more facts before committing to harsh and hasty decision-making.  We need to think wisely moving forward.

I live in France where they outlawed the Islamic veil.  Now, they\\'re considering legislation to make it illegal to NOT wear a mask.  I\\'m pretty sure that the doctor is wearing that scarf to use as a mask the moment that she\\'s not on camera.  You think? I have never seen a leader who lay blames, justify or point finger to others so much as trump. Not once he took responsibility for his own delay but lie so much. I pity the nation of America and I really pray that all of you will get out of this soon. The main reason why the numbers are so high is because of your president\\'s poor leadership! @Aspen Welch what better way to control people, then to tell them they are all infected and are a threat to one another, by loving and wanting to be close? It is truly a war on love and faith and all good things. Think about it. Healthy strong people don\\'t hide away in fear. Healthy people are loving and close to one another. weak people are hidden away in fear and believe they are diseased. A healthy loving person does not focus on being diseased and believe they are infected. Loving people do not believe everyone around them is infected and needs to be controlled and forced out of work. The virus is a war on love, presenting itself as love. @Aspen Welch I want to make it clear that you need to be ready for next winter. Millions are going to be desperate and dying because the governments forced them out of work \"for their own safety\" then when these people get sick and freeze to death in the streets and ice cold apartments, the government will say they \"died from coronavirus\" this is a lie. There is no pandemic. There are liars in the government that take advantage of naive gullible people who believe and do what they are told. @Aspen Welch Most people can\\'t comprehend he possibility that the media and governments would lie to them, but this is so. Coronavirus is a common cold virus. You can research cdc articles going back decades about coronavirus. A small clique of people that control the banks and therefore the media and government, have engineered an imaginary pandemic and planted the seeds for it in movies going back decades. This is an engineered plot to collapse the economy and seize private property. The way the media spins it, it sounds like it is a zombie plague and we all need to hide, yet they even admit that only elderly and infirm are at risk. So why would they literally force at least a third of the population out of work? How does that make any sense, that governments would literally force people not to feed their families, and say it is for their own well being and good? Obviously this is insanity. However, the lie will continue into next year. Over the coming months homelessness will run rampant and by next winter millions could die in the USA alone of exposure and suicide. There will also be many respiratory illnesses, particularly tuberculosis, which has always been a number 1 killer throughout history. The governments will lie and say that the deaths from economic collapse and exposure to cold and unsanitary conditions is \"coronavirus\" but this is just to keep people isolated and prevent communities from communicating with one another and unifying against the authorities. IF you think I am crazy and stupid and a conspiracy theorist, remember what I said when next winter comes and my prophecy comes true. this is a planned economic collapse and takeover and also a mass culling of the population. @Koehli _ With all due respect, what do you believe this I? Just curious there\\'s no pandemic. it doesn\\'t matter whether you like or hate trump. there is no pandemic, never was. it is a lie. Looking at the thumbs up and thimbs down.

Well this went against all the trump statements that he had always made the best call..Then the next day during the briefing he had to stand up and say he had used a poor choice of words..well he had indeed...he had told what he really thought..then instead of being able to inform the country about the corona virus he had to step back into line while trump took the stage and rambled for 2 hours telling of the miracles he had achieved all by himself. I know because i listened waiting for some piece of useful info..During this time Dr. Fauci had to stand at attention...when the whole country would have been better off if he had been allowed to just go get some much needed sleep.

The crash is yet to happen, that was just  a warm up. üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ Sienna Christy Also wasn‚Äôt a crash lol Sienna, he said \"within the next five years\". There\\'s a difference. The secret to my financial independence is having a steady income stream (passive investment) and a hardworking and reliable broker Richard Bill, my portfolio has grown tremendously since i started  investing with him too and I\\'m really impressed with the huge profits made. I appreciate the trust built over these past few weeks of working with Richard and I respect him for his honesty and hard work. Oh nice to meet other investors of Sir Richard. Having him as a guide, i have only recorded winnings, his hard work is even huge compared to the minor 20% commission fee he charges @Raymond Bull Yeah, you can go write him at <<officialrichardbill@gmail.com>> Traders can try all the strategies they see on YouTube. But I can tell for a fact most will still lose money due to improper knowledge on how the liquidity providers manipulate the stock charts, that is why the importance of investing with a good broker can not be over emphasized. I always advise traders to invest with Richard\\'s platform. On his platform I never experience any issues of re-quote or fake slip.

Invest long term. Solid advice :) I honestly didn\\'t think a video about investing by some guy in a hoodie would be helpful, but it totally was. Great and informative video, I learned a lot! Thanks great video!\\nCan I ask, in the senario I\\'d like to sell my stocks when the market price is high? is there always an ability to sell, regardless of the price? in other words will there always be a buyer?

A lot of people are taking advantage of the crash because eventually the market will recover and most companies will. Is it still worth investing now or should I wait till this whole pandemic thing is over? (I\\'m a beginner sorry if I sound stupid) Hey mate,\\nIm looking to get into the stock market! Your explanation has really helped me!\\nRegards,\\nBen Nice and clear explanation...\\nThanks for all the information mate..\\nwas really helpful.. The perfect video for the basics Love this, simply clear explanation & for someone that knows nothing about it I am very determined to learn about it before going in. ‚ÄúI consistently outperform the market‚Äù you lost me with this one.. For hong long have you been ‚Äúoutperforming the market‚Äù... \\nMaybe you are the next Warren Buffett. Can you do a video on the use and function of CHESS, HIN in relation to having multiple brokerage accounts? Hi Hamish, great video & really easy to understand for the beginner. I have a question for you mate... I\\'m only new to investing & have recently downloaded the new Commsec Pocket app so was wondering what\\'s your thoughts on if I was only to use the Commsec Pocket app for investing what ETFs would you recommend to in sure I have a good mix across the markets? Cheers Great place to start! The comsec app makes it very simple to invest into diversified etf\\'s globally. All you need to do is choose which one best suits your investment goals and risk tolerance :) Thanks! everything made sense now Hey Hamish, I just started watching videos on investing today. Came across your video, just wanted to say thank you for the information. Very helpful thanks mate. Same here! Great stuff thankyou for sharing Honestly, your explanation is exactly what I was looking for. it only take a well diversified market maker to point out favorable stock conditions or equivalently help to adjust your portfolio the right way, having a diverse asset spreads is ideal because it helps to reduce risk while maximizing return. Charles surely has more beneficiary portfolio. I know for sure it works Ahmet considering your trading tactics it seems more favorable. I hope it helps on my portfolio. Transparency is good for me Reach him \\nAllentradeoptions{a} gmai!‚Ä¢com He can help you achieve the same success investing with his brokerage. total transparency where you monitor your tradings and make withdrawals on your account. the stock market is evidently the biggest market in the world, perhaps that\\'s why every economic breakdown affects its market trend. Coming from one who has been a keen follower of the stock market, the stock market trade is very lucrative but along the line you would see the world is getting set for a major digital revolution. Our local and international currencies are being taken over by digital currencies and its a fast taken route. 1 bitcoin is worth over $9000 and its still on the raise. i tried bitcoin for the first time when i came across a video of it online and since then i was fascinated by it, and i met Allen Albert who taught me how bitcoin can be managed, traded to maximize profit, on my first week i made  $40,700 from an initial trading capital of $10,000. I would recommend Albert to anyone willing to try out bitcoin and how beneficial it can be, he can be reached  on tellygram *(albertrade)* or *Whatsapp *(+44 738 035 6836)* for guidance. . Let\\'s move together, these are good times Still learning under Allen Albert, but I must say, I can see the positive impact already. I now I understand charts and market flow Bitcoin over dollar anyday, I use Albert services a couple of times till I got to analyse the the market for myself With time I think, more people would be more receptive to the use of crypto currencies Digital currencies sounded crazy back then, who would have believed I would be here watching videos on them and having some for myself If only some people would be patient to understand that Bitcoin isn\\'t going anywhere, instead it\\'s taking over the globe. Significant video, it is simple to understand. hey hamish thank you for this video and your channel i am a teenager who is interested in the stock market and would like to invest sometime in the future I would like to know whats the go with investing internationaly with for eg , Tesla on an australian platform like ANZ . good or bad ?

Hey Hamish, I just started using nabtrade to trade. I am just wondering is it possible or how to do bracket/range options in that platform? Love it. Thank you for your time <3 Very well and simply explained Hamish. I\\'m going through the learning process and I\\'ve subscribed. Your words resonated with me loud and clear. Thank you! Thank you Hamish for the presentation. I am very new to investing into shares but you have given me a lot of insight  and I am beginning to get the Knowledge needed . Great video Hamish! Thanks so much for putting this together in such a clear and easy to understand way! as someone who never understood stocks, i have never come across a video that explains all elements so thoroughly such as this one! thanks heaps :)) My grandparents have givin me alot of money to me and my cousins in investments but im not sure how it works so youve made it alot more clear How much? Thanks for the infornation. I am still learning about investing.  What can you say about the online trading platforms versus the top  brokers that you mentioned? Hey Hamish! Do you need a broker? and if so where can i find one in Aus? That was great! Cheers! Looking at investing for the first time. This was really helpful! Thankyou solid work! Thanks mate very nicely explained !! thumbs up and thank you!! I‚Äôm looking at buying my first shares so have been madly reading info on the web and in magazines. Your presentation is excellent and so well structured. Thank you :) Just freaking awesome!!! Hey mate, how are you? I hope I can get your attention on my question (might be silly, but I`m totally new on it) I`m not from Australia, I`m here with student visa, but I want to start some way investing in share/stock market, do you think is possible, do you know any rules that says I cant do it? I try to find something about it, but I didn\\'t find it. Thanks btw, and your channel and that vid its awesome!!! Cheers Recently I got into the youtube financial niche, and I‚Äôve taken a deep dive into investing, particularly dividend growth investment as it interests me. Tried several methods trying to figure out the best approach to building my portfolio. So far, I‚Äôm making progress with the help of my financial advisor. Back to the video, wonderful job there, always look forward to your next content. I don‚Äôt make that much, but I sure do make enough. However, it will not be a bad idea to hear from a professional. Came across Alec Payden at an investment webinar. You can get all the information you need, just leave him a message if you have inquiries Alecpayden (a)  g ma il. Com....you can look him up if you like. It‚Äôs almost the same situation here. The difference is that I got off early enough to know that financial planning would help me go a long way. I‚Äôm in my 60‚Äôs and reaping off my hardwork. One thing that\\'s never mentioned in these stock investment video\\'s. So here goes with my advice.  If you work for a public company buy  a share or two.  Why you ask.. If you work for a company, management will never tell you exactly what they are doing especially when a new EBA is being negotiated. If you have a share you can go to the share holder meetings where you will get the truth and the ammunition to negotiate a new EBA. It\\'s a good time right now Do you make more money in Youtube than stock trading???..... And thank you for this video ..üôèüèª I resonate with the disgust involved in mentioning Bing to any extent. I am glad I am not alone in this emotion. great explanation. What do you think about selfwealth? is it trustworthy? No, don\\'t do what he says at the end. Don\\'t try and pick stocks. Just invest in ETFs and you will get similar returns over the long run with a minute fraction of the effort and maintenance... Great video. Thank you very much. And your English is very very clear. I am still learning English but I can understand your video without subtitle. Thanks, learning about this so I can teach my kid. Can you explain how to sell. For example, one of my shares I bought for $10. and now they are $30. I want to sell straight away. How do we do this? How about investing your funds on Mrs Kat Tillet Strategies where you EARN HOW 100% of your returns in trading.???? I‚Äôve been trading for going on 5 years now, and have had many experiences ranging for hours of technical analysis studies to providing Forex signals, managing accounts and even CEO of my own Forex Educational & Management Business; however what I‚Äôve learned from Kat Tillett and her team is beyond eye opening. With these teachings, I‚Äôve had nothing but continued success. Thank You Seriously. This was so informative and I finally understand the stock market a bit better! Do you have any videos on day trading or swing trading or do you simply invest for the long term? Thanks :) Just long term :) Thank u very very much! It was quite simple to understand and uve earned a subscriber today üëç I‚Äôm literally 12 and I‚Äôm trying to invest $1000. Thanks for the video! This was so helpful! Thank you for your video, it was well made and very informative. The one thing that I might still hope to learn is something specific to the ASX. You did mention using the broker of the 4 major banks but is that it? Thanks again. You might want to look at CMC markets or self wealth Dr Michael as an alternative to the big banks! Or if you are looking at an app specific to Australia then Raiz or Spaceship Voyager might be a good choice. you got me! you have skills mate. seriously. thumbs up @Hamish Hodder No worries. you\\'re certainly well communicated. I saw that first vid where you outlined the 4 steps of investing strategy. i subscribed but its not that obvious as to which video i should watch next. clicked on a few, but they lost me. which videos would you recommend watching next. beginner obviously. Thank you for watching Tobias! Great video mate really helped me out. Good stuff. TBH I would stick to US based stocks like NASDAQ, I started in Australian stocks (as i live here), however there was much more money to be made (imo) in NASDAQ than ASX. Great video. Maybe you could talked about technical analysis and fundamentals analysis. Can you do video on new IPO Manuka Resources : Gold and Silver mining company. MKR:ASX Thank you and I\\'m one of those newbies wanting to buy shares of efts but don\\'t know the difference but I want to do something in USA or Canada rather than Australia - is it the same process please?  Love the way you explain things, excellent teacher! If you want to trade in US stocks from Australia then you should check out Stake Nerisa! For ETF investing then Raiz might be better option and there is less risk. Really helpful video! Cheers Great video for beginners to the markets keep up the good work! Hi Hamish, thank you so much for the video. Is there any chat room or place where you hang out and discuss trading strategies? Also, is there anyone who would like to connect as a day trader? Great video, thank you! thanks it was very easy understanding for starter in in ASX Thank you üôè Can someone reply a company I should invest in for more bang for my buck. New to this üò©.

Feline infectious peritonitis or (FIP) is high risk in British short hair cats.  Google it and you find a world of information on it but its deadly to any cat that gets it.  Unfortunately for me I found out the hard way, I ended up getting a 4 month old British short hair kitten and 85 days later I had to put him to sleep due to FIP. \\nFIP can occur at any age, yet typically it is most often seen in young cats, less than two years of age, and most of these in the four- to 10-month period, there is no commercially effective vaccine for this disease.   I was never aware or knew anything about this disease, you can\\'t test for it.  I believed I did all the right things,  very clean house, never outside, never around any animals, no cheap cat food etc..  I ended up spending $4000 in vet fees trying to save him, I would of spent more if necessary, but it appeared in had the worse FIP (wet)... I\\'m not trying to scare you but ask your Vet about FIP. \\nIn the short time we had our kitten, he became part of the family and we changed a lot for him to make him happy.  You can see a picture of him here, but just know I was there until the very end rubbing him the way he liked it until his last breath, I know many people have gone through putting pets down but this event came out of no where and devastated us.  You see a picture of him here but he was put to sleep due to wet FIP ... https://www.toopics.com/p/2051265180806718504_12566775092 Some small corrections.  Firstly they were  first introduced in the 1st Century AD and bred with local wild cats.  They eventually became known as Barn cats, or Cheshire cats, and were useful for their ratting capabilities.  Around the time after WW1 they were bred with Persian cats, and around WW2 with Russian Blue and French Chartreux cats, that gave them a few extra colours and those orange eyes some have. I want one of those grey ones. I would name him/her: Ash vs Evil Dead ‚ù§Ô∏è Poofy cheeks. My BSH Millie is anything but quiet.

Holy crap, that\\'s clever It‚Äôs scary when the known angry dude just smiles or does nothing C C yeah my girlfriend is like that I told her to try and not be angry as often. She tries to counter her anger by smiling, so when she smiles it‚Äôs either that she‚Äôs really happy or mad. \"That\\'s why you should avoid being angry, because on the rare occasion that you do, it\\'s much more effective.\" Dom is the psychiatrist that we all need.

When a constantly angry person bursts up , it\\'s common & nobody will give a shit , BUTT if you are a monk like Phill then just a sentence is worth an hour of scolding. 2:49 Sweet ass takoyaki animasstion was badass.

Tbh, if I were you, I would have just left her on the steps... Same Ikr same aw Yeeep I agree 10000000000000000000000% I would say \"if shes not in the car in the next 5 min I\\'m leaving her.\" 2 mins seriously i don‚Äôt have patience like Dom lol 1* min for me I would have just said ‚Äúget in the car or starve‚Äù The silent treatment is scary\\n\\nBut that slow talk, monotone way of talking is much more scarier to imagine I would have told her she needs to grow up and get in the car, and if shes gonna be a 5 year old, were gonna treat her that way. Or honestly id just be like ok bye Ellen: *sits on stairs acting like a 2 year old*\\n\\nMe: *drives* Drives into a pole* me: *runs her over* I would give them a warning or two, then leave. They can figure it out. Wait... Drive into her or away? What should\\'ve happened I‚Äôve popped a blood vessel in my eye because I was so angry once. Really...... Nobody:\\nDomics teeth on the thumbnail: *HH* 6:29 everyone: acts nice and tries to convince her \\nMe: drives off without her \"Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\" - Buddha ‚ù§ this - so true! *Being angry is just wasting your energy*\\n\\n\\nThen explain Bakugo . Well bakugos voice actor had to get surgery beacuse of all the screaming he did He sleeps at 9 pm every night. So theres your answer. He doesn‚Äôt have that much energy.

Yep Same If I were Phill: I would write a letter,put it in a random position,and go home Oof @Peter Marsella God dang it I was just about to write that \"I really want to watch anime!!!\"\\nMe: Wow, so irrational.\\n*Later* Me: WHO ATE ALL THE CEREAL, I\\'M HUNGRY!!!!!!!??????? I don‚Äôt think anyone except maybe my mom has ever seen me actually angry. \\nI don‚Äôt show it often and when I get close to the point of anger I only show agitation or aggravation. \\nI keep my anger to myself. You should should‚Äôve been like \\n\\n‚ÄúYou better get in car or were leaving without you ‚Äú But our other friend *at that time*.\\n\\n*at that time*\\n\\nSo y\\'all not friends anymore? _Never go to bed angry, stay up and get even_ Are You alive? Doesn\\'t sleep being tired can lead to more aggressive behaviour fyrihead animation but seriously when i get too mad i either let my inner demon take over me (Im not even joking)or try to cry myself to sleep too not hurt anyone becuase last time i broke my bullys arm he never messed with me from now on @LGT Will man holy shit chill 2:46 That scene was EPIC, went back and watched that in slow mo Why is Phil blue?\\nLike, I\\'m not racist or anything and I don\\'t have a problem with it but,\\nWhy?

What everyone takes out of this: ‚Äúbeing mad isn‚Äôt fun, and it‚Äôs mentally taxing.‚Äù\\n\\nWhat I take out if it: Do your best to never be mad, so that when you are mad it will be a whole lot scarier. How many sponsorships have you had? I would have left Ellen..... nothing comes between me and food Same üòÇ Is that Lisa for bp That is what i was thinking BLINK!!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Same ‚ÄúI bet my dad can be up your dad.‚Äù \\nHold up.

The fact that I was about to search up how to control my anger and just stumble upon thisüíÄ Chill dude getting mad is like when the kid on the wheel chair stands up My brother deleted my Minecraft world\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*I don‚Äôt have a brother now* My brother deleted my Minecraft he 6 feet under ground SparkingBlader123 r/yourjokebutworse Oh ok Mr Luca u uave commited a GREAT CRIME!!!!! did u reall just delete him from extincence Dom: Alright day goodbye to your ride.\\nEllen: *WAIT NO-* How domics angry : if we stranded on a island I would not hesitate to build a raft out of your limb\\nHow Communism angry : *declare a war on every country* 6:00 if I were you I would have told her to either get in the car or we leave and you don\\'t eat. if i was in that situation and a grown ass adult was throwing a tantrum over a car seat, i would‚Äôve just driven off and left her there \"I\\'m mad because I can\\'t see my forehead.\"\\nOnly legends get that reference I\\'m a super chill dude, like people call me weird sometimes when I\\'m supposed to be mad but I\\'m just like \"Eh\"\\nI got hit by a motorbike moron not following traffic laws once and still have that scar on my feet when I was dragged on the road with the bike, I\\'m still not mad at that guy and just let him go\\n\\nBut a \"friend\" of mine, a known prankster in highschool, would now stop messing with me while I was trying to finish a homework during Study Hall before the next class begin. I snapped, hold his ears with enough force to tear it, and talk in a very stern voice to shut the fuck up and let me work in peace. The class went silent, like dead silent after that\\n\\nDon\\'t mess with the quiet ones, they\\'re usually the scariest when they reach their limit Me who gets angry over very small things like someone mispronouncing my name:\\n\\n\\n\\n           0-O HOW DO YOU STAY SO C A L M ? Same \" _Sometimes to win is to walk away_ \" - *Dom* \"And that\\'s why you should avoid being angry, because on the rare occasion that you do... *it\\'s much more effective* \"\\n\\n\\n^true advice @SomeGuyOnTheMemernet101 For not fighting back, yes, you are. Very true. My physical example is my dad. He rarely gets angry, it\\'s scary but can make everyone shut up for more than an hour which ish gud Or the person that\\'s being yelled at doesn\\'t understand why they\\'re being yelled at. True, im rarely really angry so my friends are actually terrified when i am lol. true true... Maybe if everyone wasn\\'t so DUM- the whole point of this video is: never get angry or do it in a way that freaks out everyone. in kindergarten, my kindergarten teacher read a book during reading aloud, noticed that the name of the main character was similar to the one she heard my mom use, and proceeded to call me that name for the rest of the year. this went on until 2nd grade when she stopped calling me the name and proceeded to point me out in large groups. in 3rd grade, I started hiding from her because of it. during assemblies, when she went on stage, I  would look down in hopes she wouldn\\'t see me. when I was walking in the hallways, I would take the route farthest from her classroom. in 4th grade, as the end of the school year drew closer and closer, I started to hope that she would be replaced next year. turns out I spoke too soon. in 5th grade, on continuation day, as soon as I left the building, I got a cookie with my name on it, left the premises, and was soooooooooooo happy. there is no way I will ever go back to that drive-thru-of-a-school ever again. If I were in your situation with ellen, here‚Äôs what would have happened:\\nI would get out of the car\\nSay: I am the only one that have a car so it‚Äôs either you get in or you starve \\nThen I would give her my stone cold fake smile.\\nIf she doesn‚Äôt, then I will just go back in the house and get all of my stuff and go to a hotel. Uh quick question why didn‚Äôt you guys just leave ‚ÄúEllen‚Äù there on the porch I would‚Äôve within the first five minutes. She can walk @Reallylongweshanks YT  it\\'s really not like that. If they are being that kind of childish asshole then don\\'t include them in the activity. You could also just drive around the block and come back like a few other people here have said. You don\\'t teach an adult a lesson like you teach a child one. If they didn\\'t learn as a child with softer ways of teaching then this time you need to be harder about it. You need to drive off, not only because it will teach her a lesson but also because then you guys can enjoy the rest of the night without being so uncomfortable like it was in the story. Yup ditch her Thank you Thats what i thought. Who just realized that his intro sounds like the ph intro 6:10 wouldn‚Äôt that bee like rlly personal to tell 7m *cough fake *caught \"We\\'ll call him, Adam.\" \\n\\n\\nMe: *AND EVE* If i were you with ellen i would have said ‚Äúif you ever dare make that outburst ever again i wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to cut off your hair so you will be bald forever‚Ä¶okay let‚Äôs go! :3‚Äù I would honestly just drive off without the ungrateful brat. üòÇ Same üòÇ @Fortnite boy 92 But it\\'s worth it. same Yup leave dat bi* üòÇ same When my friend Daelan gets angry he gives off an aura of rage so thick it summons a jojo stand 2:47 Does he have any more videos with this kind of animation, I like the normal, I just want to see more.

I had therapy though...\\nSince then, I rarely ever get angry (much less than most others around me). I did get a little angry at a shopkeeper a few years back and yelled at him, my friends were immediately like: \"Woah dude..? You okay?\" \"You know those times when you are angry for so long, you get.. tired?\" Yup, i feel u Dom is right I‚Äôm just gonna never be mad until than one guy I hate comes up When I was little I destroyed everything in my room when I get angry. \\nAnd now I just go cry in bathroom.

My girlfriend committed suicide 3 years ago. Her and I were together for almost 7 years. She never once talked to me without telling me that she loved me more than anything. Every time we had an argument, she would hug me until I calmed down. We would go on drives most weekends out to empty spaces, we would park the car and lay on the hood and stare at the stars. Often times we would have long deep conversations for hours until we fell asleep holding each others hands tightly. We both always knew, we would never cheat, never leave. It would never be worth it, and we always saw the amazing person standing in front of us. When I couldn\\'t stand to look at my own reflection, she complimented me on how many people would rather be me, than their own selves. She told me her deepest, darkest secrets, and was never scared to tell the truth, no matter how painful it might\\'ve been. We dated from middle school and high school, and even college. We spent years, on the bus, listening to music, looking in each others\\' eyes. Most days we took the bus home to my house, and spent the whole day playing card games. board games, and watching movies. We were more than lovers, we were best friends, we were family. I met her in a mental hospital after we both had attempted suicide. She has taught me so much. And even though she is not here today, I know that she wants me to stay alive, to keep pushing my limits, regardless of what others think. I wish I could\\'ve saved her. Been there for her more. Every time I listen to this song I am reminded of her, and her everlasting kindness, and good heart, no matter what she was feeling. She was truly selfless. So I say to you, scrolling through the comments, STAY SAFE, STAY HEALTHY, AND STAY ALIVE. YOU ARE LOVED. Tears Lol xD I saw this exact comment under a photograph lyric video. I teared up reading this, my girlfriend committed suicide 2years ago. I still think of her everyday When I heard the news I tried to take my life, I did. This was her favorite song. I met her in 5grade all the way to Highschool we were both seniors when she killed herself. I still regret not being with her that day üò©üò©üòñüò´üò´üò´ hopefully me and her can meet again in heaven one day.

(note this  it about other ppl).  really love this song because it actually reminded me about my past. my 1st friend was from middle school we  things and we do things together. He alright but there  to say. He told me that he was about to end is life because what going  life.  let him decide his fate. but the  about that same moment.  was a   let my  the line and did nothing but watch.  me as a friend.  was  did but still.  wash he forget about me  his back.  my transgender  still a great friend. Most of the time my friend would come from the bus to  we would talk about things that are going on or thing of what would we do, and sometimes she would come to  different expression.  tried many times to talk  words are pointless. and sometimes she would just yell at me because she needed some  if she is okay because she is still in middle school. My last friend is one of my  have. She is my funny friend but most people at school hate her  is. and some of her friends just leave her behind. what  to say here is  be like me.   a scum on earth. be a better friend guys and make sure you always have your friends back. stay safe guys. i was hearing this song is 2014 now am here it on 2020 old times 100 Reasons To Stay Alive <3 \\n1. to make your parents proud \\n2. to conquer your fears \\n3. to see your family again \\n4. to see your favorite artist live \\n5. to listen to music again \\n6. to experience a new culture \\n7. to make new friends \\n8. to inspire \\n9. to have your own children \\n10. to adopt your own pet \\n11. to make yourself proud \\n12. to meet your idols \\n13. to laugh until you cry \\n14. to feel tears of happiness \\n15. to eat your favorite food \\n16. to see your siblings grow \\n17. to pass school \\n18. to get tattoo \\n19. to smile until your cheeks hurt \\n20. to meet your internet friends \\n21. to find someone who loves you like you deserve \\n22. to eat ice cream on a hot day \\n23. to drink hot chocolate on a cold day \\n24. to see untouched snow in the morning \\n25. to see a sunset that sets the sky on fire \\n26. to see stars light up the sky \\n27. to read a book that changes your life \\n28. to see the flowers in the spring \\n29. to see the leaves change from green to brown \\n30. to travel abroad \\n31. to learn a new language \\n32. to learn to draw \\n33. to tell others your story in the hopes of helping them \\n34.

I liked it so much and now I found it and I just cry cause I remember how much I love Marcus and Martinus. I can\\'t imagine my life without them. They have changed my life and myself completely. I just can\\'t live without you ‚ù§ü§û this is mine and my boyfriends song because it reminds us of each other and also because we are doing long distance.

Ms. Love Urself thank you so much U will find üíúüíúüíú someday\\nIm sure of itüòäüòäüòä Sometimes it\\'s not the lyrics of the song that make you cry \\nIt\\'s the people you think about while listening to the lyrics. ÿß Yeah i agree i do it all the time :) memories, lies, fake love. Im a crybaby. Yes Truee Yes I listen to this song most of the times when i cry because I know that I am loved by my girlfriend and my parents but I feel unsafe from now on that I didn\\'t see my girlfriend for 3 months and we reunited but that wasn\\'t the hard part the hard part is that every time she comes to my party she only stays for 1-2 hours and she is the love of my life but why can\\'t she stay longer? my parents doesn\\'t know what I am going through in life only my girlfriend does because we tell everything to each other but not always but we kinda broke up in march because we had so much fights and arguments so yea this is my short story of me and my girlfriend we are hoping to find a place and live together forever. I need new memories with this girl because If she ever finds someone new I would be in depression mode crying all day. so yea if you wanna follow my insta i do not accept xoxo.sereniityyy. so like people hate me saying that i do not talk i do not have a mouth to talk they hate me and even though my girl is loyal doesn\\'t she will be loyal to other girls or boys. sorry if you see this I could never relate to a song more than this Why is a song so sad if my cats die I want to die and when I die I will cry of happyness cuz I can see my cats üò≠üòø This is a story of my best friend \\nOr how I lost my best friend \\n\\nMe and my best friend have been friends for 6 years. Let\\'s call her X.\\nX was the only close person to me and I grew feelings for her. One day I thought that I will tell her how I feel. But I heard she was moving to another city and it was impossible for me to meet her again so I gave her a ring as a symbol of our friendship. The last thing she said \"if we ever meet again, the first thing I will say to you is I love you \"\\nThis song always reminds me of her\\nAnd I just wish I can meet her again To the 1% who read read this \\n\\nYour skin isn\\'t paper, don\\'t cut it\\n\\nYour face isn\\'t a mask, Don\\'t cover it\\nYour body isn\\'t a book, Don\\'t judge it\\n Your life isn\\'t a movie, Don\\'t end it\\n\\n\\nYour heart isn\\'t a door, don\\'t lock it \\n\\nYou\\'re beautiful üòç\\nBe you....

I was watching AC/DC and a Delta Parole music videos and now this. Tha hell. not complain tho kek 1:55 cute (p.s my name is not gian thats my dad) From the start of lockdown here in the Philippines, i got stucked in the house. One of the regular visitor (mother cat) of the house came by one night with her 4 kittens. They started playing in front of my unit. I tried to grab them to play but they are scared and kept on running. Few days by, i notice that out of 4, only 2 was left. Until one day, only one stayed within my place. She was still tiny and no mother to care for her. I was inspired on those people as they forster those left out animals. I tried to feed her with cat food and milk. 6 months later, she is grown healthy. I have uploaded some of her videos on my channel and would appreciate to if you can view her videos.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/cAq4uk4L6i4\\n\\n Looking forward in making more videos.

The truth is that, if it was you Justin Bieber married instead, the whole world will hate you too. Is it a crime that he is famous. It isn\\'t okay!. He only showed what he wanted us to see. There are million of girls in this world and if he married her instead that is his problem, it isn\\'t yours. All girls are beautiful in their own ways and haily is really pretty. We blocked that fact and focused on our hatred for him. \\n\\nAnd those of you shipping jelena, it didn\\'t work out. They know what happened between them. See guys if you really love Justin bieber , you would want him to be happy and if this is what makes him happy, let let it be it. Hailey sorry for all the pain we have caused you. I am sure Justin Bieber doesn\\'t even read his comments again because of the hate being directed to the couple. Please stop shaming them, it is totally wrong.  \\n\\n\\nPlease can you pin my comment so people would see this. \\n\\nThanks so much and I wish success in your wedding Hey guys I have something to say.

One stat I found was in the 60s only 25% of American families were dual income, now that figure is 64% and having added all those extra shifts & hours they still want say people are poor because they‚Äôre lazy, irresponsible or addicted. Liam Scott - Tell me, how do you explain away a clip like this: https://youtu.be/GbvNhQ4lYLE\\nThere is only so much scrimping & saving someone can do when you‚Äôre headed for the food bank every months. The politicians have rigged the game of life to ensure that the rich get more wealthy, the poor get poorer & the only certainty is that it will get worst. Yeah they don‚Äôt talk about how we work harder and get less pay. If you look at a graph of productivity compared to wages the productivity goes up over time and so do the wages until about 1970 and then it stagnates that was when the oil crisis happened and all of this started when they realize that there wasn‚Äôt enough meat on the bones for them to keep making as much money as they want and for us to get paid fairly so guess which one they chose to get rid of inflation is always relative to wages, that\\'s why poverty exists, to increase the wage of low skilled workers will increase the price of goods and the goods become more affordable to everyone, prices only reduce during economic downturns, and businesses are smart to ensure providing they turn a profit that they can maximise that profit, interestingly, the baked beans war is an example of this, look into it, it\\'s pretty hilarious but a brilliant example of how competition drives down prices, and supermarkets will match prices according to what  the average household can afford (unfortunately energy is a different matter, while efforts to go green are good for the planet, they do drive up energy costs due to inefficient energy production, if people cant pay their bills then cheaper fossil fuels will rise in energy production, generally the people these coal plants are set up to help in keeping energy costs low are harmed the most as its often the poorer areas that these are built in, short term they do their job, produce energy and provide jobs to poor areas close to where they are built, long term they do damage to the population through the long term health issues associated with coal suet) the other methods of clean energy are feared, mainly nuclear power, however studies have shown that this is a solution to affordable energy, that being that energy bills in France for example are far lower than in natural resources Germany, while we all want a clean planet, there are trade offs, and as always, the poorest of society will bare the brunt of any trade off made, ironically, Nuclear power is actually safer statistically to coal plants, go figure, but like an air plane is statistically safer than driving, when an accident does happen, it happens in a catastrophic manner. As for water, in Scotland we haven\\'t really had a shortage of it ever, and i guess that\\'s because we have some of the highest standards of tap water in the UK, a lot of that is more attributed to sedimentary rock and our mountainous terrain, while drought is an issue that spans the globe, one that should be studied to make water plentiful, available and cheep, it\\'s not an issue that we have ever really had, hence my ability to comment on how to ensure that basic need is supplied i can\\'t say. the bottom line is the economy is more complicated than a lot of people realise, and several factors go into what rich actually is, but part is discipline, save in the good times to prepare for the bad times, and do it when you\\'re young, i\\'m trying to do this now, and i can sympathise as it isn\\'t easy, however, i know it wont get any easier, hence the need to start now, probably the fact i don\\'t go on nights out, drink too often or smoke makes a big difference in the amount of income i can keep saved, while there\\'s nothing wrong with enjoy9ing yourself every now and then, if you set yourself a limit, and don\\'t go over that, and keep these situations to a minimum, you could save a lot of money while wages don\\'t increase in similarity to inflation, they are higher for the common man now more than they\\'ve ever been, as an economy grows, so does inflation grow with it, Krakow in Poland is considered an expensive place to live for many who live in Poland, but to a tourist it\\'s extremely cheep, with money from the exchange rate going a long way, it is 2 fold, the more money you have, the more you spend, on the other hand, many give into social pressure, a good way to save money for example is just eating out less and cut down on non essentials. while easier for some more than others, but I\\'m the type of person that wont throw out an old pair of shoes until my existing ones have a massive hole in them, again, that\\'s how we all vary. *\"O\" shaped :* Cycles of collapse into Primitivism.\\n*\"F\" shaped :* The Singularity and Immortality creates two high tiers - the Have-Somes and Have-Everythings.\\n*\"S\" shaped :* Time travel is invented, and colonists return to the past with superior tech, causing an immediate boost, followed by stagnation in decadence once the endlessness of the universe sets-in.\\n*\"P\" shaped :* Time travel is invented, causing an immediate boost as the past is pillaged for high-end collectibles, until the future-future arrives to raid this one of its own collectibles.\\n*\"X\" shaped :* An alien civilization collapses, and refugees crash on Earth, causing a flowering of knowledge, here.\\n*\"I\" shaped :* Time is an illusion.

The ones on top get bailed out and given low/negative interest loans to buy up the assets from the people at the bottom. This isn\\'t capitalism, this is corruption. As always. That\\'s a terrible assessment. What we actually have is the culmination of the political class\\'s wet dream of crony capitalism.  The rich and the big boys get to operate and the entrepreneurs and self starters will literally have their doors kicked in and thrown in a cage if they even dare TRY to outcompete and outperform the rich connected people.  It\\'s regulatory red tape on steroids. @El Dimos Karam  If a company gets a bailout it effects the stock and cash on hand of the company, allowing for money to be given to the top (or anyone). However, if you own a company, you grow based on demand, not based on taxes or money in your account. If Ford sells 10,000 cars a year, it would be foolish to build a new factory if the demand stays the same. @Keoki Higa thanks! I appreciate it!

My view on American politics is that it\\'s a complete mess that is way past the point where it is even possible to sort it out. Every time I think of genuine solutions to problems in American politics I also think of the hundreds of reasons why all those good ideas are political impossibilities. I\\'ve taken to calling it Andrew Yang Syndrome after the Democratic candidate who personified just how far American politics is from accepting reformist ideas.\\n\\nFrom my perspective the absolute best that you folks over the pond can hope for, no matter what your political ideology is, is a watered down half measure solution to problems. Additionally I feel incredibly sorry for you with your options for President. Last election you had a choice between an incompetent ego-maniac and a corrupt politician who personifies the DC establishment. This election you have the same ego-maniac against a doddering old fool who may have dementia who\\'s best policies are ripped off from his rival candidates for the Dem nomination. It really is a spectacular mess.\\n\\nIt\\'s also the only comfort looking at the mess that is politics in my own country, \\'At least it\\'s not as bad as American politics\\'. I will actually agree that people in the west, or at least the US, are entitled, but I think it goes beyond wanting more for less. The rich are very entitled - when they buy a home, they think they are buying the neighborhood. If there were no zoning regulations, or if it was commonplace to use eminent domain to replace sprawling detached homes with highrise condos to address shortages, or if we switched to a Georgist land value tax, people\\'s attitudes and expectations around urban planning and real estate would change rapidly.

Tends to happen in more traditional countries.) That won\\'t happen here with a media fanning racial tensions, endless groups of racial identitarians rising and falling, and  the self centered status culture America has.  If you want that kind of progress, we need to get manufacturing on the level that is of china to pay for it all and cause a cultural revolution to not get mad/react at racism (in turn causing an emotional response and giving the attenion seakers what they want) and in stead just think less of that person and move on.

Ooooo so excited to give my Guillotine a whirl!!! revolution, yeah\\n\\nCarl Sagan\\'s last interview - 1996\\n27 May 1996, interview with Charlie Rose, USA\\n\\nSAGAN: My feeling, Charlie, is that it\\'s not that pseudoscience and superstition and New Age so-called \"beliefs\" and fundamentalist zealotry are something new. They\\'ve been with us for as long as we\\'ve been human. But we live in an age based on science and technology, with formidable technological powers.\\n\\nROSE: Science and technology are propelling us forward at accelerating rates.\\n\\nSAGAN: That\\'s right. And if we don\\'t understand it, and by \"we\" I mean \"the general public,\" if it\\'s something that, \"Oh, I\\'m not good at that, I don\\'t know anything about it,\" then who is making all the decisions about science and technology that are going to determine what kind of future our children live in? Just some members of Congress? But there\\'s no more than a handful of members of Congress with any background in science at all. And the Republican Congress has just abolished its own Office of Technology Assessment‚Äîthe organization that gave them bipartisan, competent advice on science and technology. They say, \"We don\\'t want to know. Don\\'t tell us about science and technology.\"\\n\\nROSE: Surprising. What\\'s the danger of all this? I mean, this is not the thing that...\\n\\nSAGAN: There\\'s two kinds of dangers. One is what I just talked about. That we\\'ve arranged a society based on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power, sooner or later, is going to blow up in our faces. I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don\\'t know anything about it? And the second reason that I\\'m worried about this is that science is more than a body of knowledge. It\\'s a way of thinking. A way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we\\'re up for grabs for the next charlatan political or religious who comes ambling along. It\\'s a thing that Jefferson laid great stress on. It wasn\\'t enough, he said, to enshrine some rights in a Constitution or a Bill of Rights. The people had to be educated, and they had to practice their skepticism and their education. Oherwise we don\\'t run the government‚Äîthe government runs us. That may be true, but the poorest 50% of Americans are much better off than the French peasants and the French didn\\'t have government welfare and had a lot of food insecurity so I wouldn\\'t hold my breath waiting for the guillotines to come out. Advancing technology has made the rich significantly wealthier, but it has helped everyone else out as well. I\\'ve been saying this since the first lockdown. Nothing economically changed when you really think about it, it just sped up what was already happening- rich people were getting richer and poor people were getting poorer as small businesses that couldn\\'t survive without a few months of income folded and megacorps like Walmart scooped up their customer base. the American government made the predictable decision of Money go brrrrr in the shape of more corporate subsidies as if they weren\\'t already getting enough while everyone else got a very measly stimulus check of $1200 to survive an entire year of pandemic. This is all happening very fast, but wasn\\'t it all already happening? As a late \\'90s child who watched my parents lose their house in the Recession and never financially recover from it, has this not already been happening my entire life? @comment Ah see  now there is the problem.  By offering lower prices for worse products Walmart can drive the small, local business under.  Sure, many of us would pay a little more for the local or greener choice if we can afford it, but many can\\'t.  A good example of this is milk.  You will pay for Walmart\\'s cheap, hormone riddled milk instead of paying more for the better product from the local farmer\\'s market.  As a result your children are malnourished and cannot thrive the way rich kids do.  You buy cheaper food that will end up giving them Diabetes because that is all you can afford.  The American economy is tailor made to keep the poor at the bottom and allow the rich stay on top. @B He I know right? @Nanook128 Pretty simple innit? @B He oh yes, buy gold when you\\'re living paycheck to paycheck.

So saying that \"literally every single economist with any qualification or education\" disagrees with me is a bit disingenuous.

In practice, raising minimum wage generally doesn\\'t significantly raise prices (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052815/does-raising-minimum-wage-increase-inflation.asp) America has had a k shaped economy beginning with Reagan The great depression was horrible, but it least it was more fair than post-Reagan america J-shaped recovery: after the Lockdown, _we become gods_ @Nihilism username checks out 4of92000 I am already a god, as in, my existence is the only one that matters to me in the whole universe, and the rest can die for all I care. @comment then I don\\'t yeah, gods shouldn\\'t need police.. ok, i get it We become cherubim. But we think we\\'re gods. That\\'s what inflation does to society. Kind of ignore the wealth siphoning effect that having large corporations snapping up massive amounts of property in order to rent them later after people foreclose or are forced to sell to stay afloat. The constant increasing of rent seeking behaviors is one of the major drivers to prolonged growth in wealth inequality. Hard to drag yourself out of the working class with such a large portion of your country\\'s economy built off the concept of leeching profits out of your need for shelter.

The conclusion is a bit over-simplistic. It\\'s easy to say \"we should have multi-generational families\" but we keep forgetting that the nature of modern economy forces a lot of people to relocate in big cities from rural towns.

I have a feeling that we are seeing why historically, that societies stratify. The real question is have we had anything but K shaped recoveries since the early 80s? Betting against the US market is one of the best options right now. @Manesh Gray  yea that\\'s for a fact, I like the fact he short trade, tho he appears as a long term investor.

To tell them to \"pull themselves by their bootstraps\" while a minuscule elite profits off of low salaries, never managing to fully realize the connection between the two legs of the K, is stupidity.\\n\\nYour geatest error is not being able to conceive of a society where K-shaped crises are impossible because there is no financial elite. It pushes you to solutions as childish and deluded as \"the government controlled by monopolies should go against their interest to help the masses\" and \"live below your means, even if your means were miserable during economic growth.\"\\n\\nYou\\'d look at the starving Parisian masses marching towards Versailles, proclaim that the King should do something to stop his Court from increasing its wealth, and then turn to the people and tell them to save their bread money to buy cakes. Indeed, most of the stimulus has gone to the wealthy who are not exactly using that money to hire more workers, pay them well and train them for better jobs. There should have a lot of strings attached, but of course, there\\'s no way the US Senate would ever do that and oppose their \"owners\". Thank you! To say nothing of the structural realities that have determined such a massive increase in wealth disparity while proposing individual solutions is absurd. Somehow stagnant wages, ballooning consumer debt, and skyrocketing costs of living are supposed to result in a higher savings rate for \"emergencies\" ? Ridiculous. The only thing that is being overconsumed is the surplus value of the workers who are spending more hours achieving greater productivity for lower wages. A precarious workforce benefits the capitalist class but it does not benefit society, and we do not need to keep feeding this beast. The way you dance around the failures of capitalism are truly entertaining. \\n\\nOverspent Americans? 30% of Americans only make enough money to meet their basic needs, and that was during your so called \"good times\". Another 30% only made enough to purchase physical assets, like houses, but not make any savings/investments. \\n\\nHere is the real truth to your K shaped economy:\\n\\nThose who own the means of production (businesses, stocks, land, resources, copyrights) will prosper. Everyone else is fucked. And even then, if you don\\'t own enough means, you\\'ll probably wind up getting gobbled up by a bigger fish down the road. There isn\\'t even really a point of starting a small business if you\\'re just going to get wiped out 10 years down the road by the next capitalist crisis. The bar for being \\'safe\\' is so high now that for...pretty much 99% of Americans it doesn\\'t make sense to even try to go for it. Yeah, it\\'s joke of the year to prop up Koreans and Singaporeans doing it right \"just live with your parents and save money\". Uh, that\\'s austerity, you can do it as a sustenance farmer. The reason economy doesn\\'t adjust back to actually building houses for people is because profit-seeking and copyright law push all the money out of material trade in favor of virtual goods and currency, number one being the money that tax man has an unlimited royalty benefit for and which economists push as the only thing that measures growth. That virtualization of genuine value causes bubbles like the housing bubble.\\n\\nDelivering packages of produced materials can never compete with companies with allowance to basically pirate their product infinitely with a copy-paste-button. Modern day buccaneering, if we go off the piracy metaphor. Capitalism would be neat, just like Lenins fantasies of communism were neat until people started dying. Both just  competing 19th century ideological pipe dreams, they don\\'t exist in reality  except as flags waved by forced division into global gang warfare of Bloods vs Crips. ‚Äù... have an Emergency Fund.‚Äù\\nMe: *Sweats in 80% of savings in the stock market* The L-shape non-recovery. @SkyTech RTS\\nEvery important political candidate and office member: *guess I‚Äôll die* Well we already got the middil upside down v in a w recovery so I don‚Äôt understand unless you mean Kampala Harris gets elected & we get a lesbian economy Kulak Adam And Pakistan Yep, thats the story of Turkey I want an X shaped recovery the rich all die off in misery while everyone else\\'s lives improve:) It is a \"i\" recovery curve. While we return to stoneage the 5% travel to live in the moon. And so we recreate the world of Conan the barbarian hahahaha The thing is, the upper class WANTS the K. The western concept that children have to leave their families once they\\'re adult enough to sustain is an extremely flawed concept. This is why most rich families in US or everywhere in general tend to have structures where children live with their families so that they can concentrate the wealth in the family in a more proper way. Most Americans (and Westeners in general) are actually short-sighted in this logic and don\\'t know the benefits on staying with their parents and families. I was thinking just that when I read your message, muti generational living. My experience with grand parents was they liked to see the kids when they where little but didn\\'t what to get there hands dirty so would that really work. Personally I\\'d love to do it. It\\'s not a western concept, just part of american culture, what you describe is uncommon in europe. @comment divorces were rarer back then..till death do us apart was actually practiced..as education and empowerment has come it is rising..but then again people are marrying really late in my country now so I think that too helps..joint family and late marriage..but I think we are all missing the point of saving..but personally for me its more its more emotional decision than economical decision.. @comment their are actually 2 subparts of a joint family thing. The first type of joint family is the one in which grandparents , the sons , daughters , daughters-in-law and all the children live together. This thing has been dying here in Asia since the last century because the houses aren\\'t as large as they used to be. Also , the entire environment used to be extremely toxic ad their used to interference by relatives in every individual decision that one wanted to take. \\nThe second type of family is a more nuclear concept where the parents and the children stay together. The grandparents often stay with one of their children (if their are more than 1 child which usually isn\\'t the case anymore). They can also keep shifting between their children if they are living seperately due to smaller houses these days (usually a 3 or 4 bedroom independent house or apartment) for a few months or years so that everybody gets to live with them. This is generally more preferred way of living. \\nJust wanted to clarify how societies live in Asia these days. \\nI have grown up in a nuclear family where I\\'m still living with my parents and although they are already planning to buy a new house for me and we are already saving money for that , this would only be a temporary thing as I am getting married in a few years and our current house isn\\'t large enough (we live in a 3 bedroom apartment). Once I\\'ll have sufficient savings in 5-7 years , we\\'ll have a larger house and me , my wife , the kids and my parents would all live together. This is actually the most common and ideally preferred way of living. @Larry You know, i don\\'t know where that comes from, but all the young people that age that i know have no problem living with parents at all. Usually they move away only if the job or the education they get demands it or if they get married. Absolute truth! These young i know get along with their peers just as well as with parents and even frequently invite each other over to parents\\' houses. I think these generations are actually very practical and very common sense oriented. Of course NOT the woke ones, i\\'m not even talking about those stupid ones :). I\\'m talking about normal, well raised, balanced young people. The implication of K shaped recovery is that the poor part of the economy never had a recession in the first place. You\\'re describing a y. @Blue Mountain  i think he rotates the y 90 degrees clockwise. As from his interpretation of K shaped, he rotates it anticlockwise The poor people travel back in time? 70% Americans have less than 1000 USD saved? Have you missed a ‚Äò0‚Äô? That is terrifying, if true. @Bob McBobbington They do after they have invested in things that will appreciate in value, not before.\\n\\nIf you have spent your life accumulating assets, you can afford to be wasteful. Only after though, not \"instead of.\"\\n\\nPeople spend their lives wasting their disposable cash and then blame everybody but themselves when they have nothing to show for it.\\n\\nBut yes I should have elaborated and expanded on my earlier comment. It was oversimplified. Stay safe. @Gerald Tyler Yeah, the rich don\\'t buy electronics, shoes or cars. No sir. I think the true number is 400 dollars. don\\'t know where I heard that though. Edit: Gordon Gekko mentions it too two posts above me with specifics. @J B lol. Like we could afford a pool, let alone a boy to look after it. But good meme. I\\'m pretty certain this statistic is referring to cash on hand. A couple of years ago the Federal Reserve conducted a survey that found 40% of adults said they would not be able to cover a $400 unexpected expense with cash -- they would either not be able to pay it or would do so by selling something or borrowing the money. V shaped recovery is impossible.\\nEvery recovery has always been K shaped, and the K shape is getting worse every time. This video could be re-titled \"The real reason Trump let the virus in.\" 9:45 \\'dry powder\\' is an apt metaphor for pirates like Blackstone, waiting in the shadows for weaker prey to appear on the horizon. This is a pathetic analysis. The idea that the working stiff has to tighten their belts some more so that we can continue this system of cyclical recession/depression robbery that efficiently sucks up the wealth of the 90% into the pockets of the 10% is lunacy. This is not a sustainable economy. Most folks in the US don\\'t have the resources for a $500 emergency, and you think they need to save more?  The solution is to have a very aggressive wealth tax with no loopholes for both individuals and corporate entities. We need to acknowledge that to have a society where millions are living below the poverty line and less than 50 individuals have more wealth than 75% of our population combined is not a social good. Nobody needs more than a billion dollars to live, and we should make it very hard to have that amount of money and have an upper limit on corporation market caps, say $50 billion. Billionaires and Trillion dollar corporations are not  a good thing because they put too much political power in the hands of the rich who bribe  and threaten our politicians into ignoring the needs of the general public. Wings of Purity Official Only 8% actually inherited all their wealth. The other 25% simply used their inheritance as a supplement, so it is actually closer to 80-90% @Timber Stalker I was asking because if entrepreneurship was such a worthy investment, why isn\\'t the amount of self made milionaires closer to 80 or 90%? Wings of Purity Official Look up ‚ÄúHow many millionaires are self made‚Äù and you‚Äôll find plenty of sources.\\n\\nEven if people do work, which they often won‚Äôt. Just look at most homeless people, they won‚Äôt have any incentive to try hard, as they get no extra compensation. You can spend a few extra hours on YouTube. \\nAnd Trust me, I‚Äôm pretty sure in the future people won‚Äôt need jobs and will be able to do whatever they want because robots will have all the jobs, but we‚Äôre nowhere near that level of autonomy yet. @Timber Stalker The reason some socialist societies has led to empty shelves is because they did not have the necessary technology to substitute menial human labor, and actively sought to hinder the development of such technologies. That technology is becoming more and more possible. And as for the whole \"people would just sit on their asses and do nothing\" argument, would you do the same if you got free money? @Timber Stalker source? Reality: Money spent on rent and food, or sometimes having to choose between the two doesn\\'t give you much opportunity to save a dime. \\n\\nEconomics Explained: Don\\'t live beyond your means.\\n\\nThis dude is delusional. @gia manchild master race he means, if you pay rent because you will not live with your parents because you are not a manchild then you are living beyond your means \"Someone asked me if I had plans for the fall and it took me a moment to realize they meant \"autumn,\" not the collapse of civilization.\" In Chinese they call it a Âá∏-shaped recovery and a Âáπ-shaped recovery That\\'s top and bottom in gay lingo in japanese \\'__\" \"A\\xa0K-shaped recovery occurs when an economy recuperates unevenly, and there‚Äôs a separate trajectory for two segments of the society.\" \"Contractionary fiscal policy is like an Athlete training in low oxygen\". Ahh, yes, the economy is an Athlete. \"Wealthiest became more wealthy\" \\n*we have nothing to lose but our chains* And our food X shaped recovery, everyone goes on their own agenda until they reach back down to the low (bottom-right.)\\nLater growth ensues. People living beyond their means has been one of the main drivers of the US economy for decades.\\nThose billions sitting in investment funds waiting to buy up cheap foreclosed property were extracted from the same people whose homes are being foreclosed, because the consumer debt economy has been encouraged at every turn by business and by government. I solemnly predict that we will have a √Ü shaped recovery. This is a Norwegian recoveryüòä √¶√¶√¶!\\nAs a Norwegian l can actually pronounce that in several dialects. No we will have a –∂ shaped recovery Soon after that a Èë∞ recovery Light cone-shaped recovery. 17:03 , yea, I\\'m already 24 going 25, and still living my parents. I do plan to move out by age 27 at the very least, cuz I think I won\\'t be able to learn to actually become an adult if I continue to live with my parents. But I gotta say, living with my parents allows me to save about 60-70% of my disposable income much of which would have gone to housing, food, water and electricity bills, transportation not to mention furniture if I lived alone, hehe. I wonder if Economics Explained will make a video on \"How to lower the cost of living\" given our current economic climate. If everything is going up in value and wages are more or less stagnant, is there any realistically-feasible way to lower that price for consumers and still make a profit for businesses? Would be nice to know ü§î @HauntedShadowsLegacy I didn\\'t say they were an option for all people nor did I say it isn\\'t currently practiced. My point was that the stigma of multigenerational housing in the US means that in most cases the only people who live in a house shared by multiple adult generations are the people who can\\'t afford to live on their own. If it became acceptable for adult children who have good jobs to live with their parents we would have more available housing and on average more  money available for goods and services which would reduce the costs of living in most areas by reducing housing prices and allow more money to be actively circulating in the economy. The price of strawberries is unlikely to be significantly effected by this change and is therefore not particularly relevant. @Gareth Baus Multigenerational households are already a thing in America (have been for at least the past decade), and they\\'re not the best for people from abusive households. So, nice sentiment, I guess, but a medium-sized carton of strawberries still costs seven bucks where I live. One thing that could help would be to destigmatize multigenerational households, it would reduce the demand for housing and would free up more money for other things. It wouldn\\'t solve the problem but it would help reduce the cost of living in many areas. Basically the working class needs to live in poverty so the capital class can live like royalty. Ok, got it. The flatness of wages/salaries lends more and more credence everyday to the notion that feminism was predominantly a project of industry. It flooded the labor market with workers and the subsequent pay to those workers has been far outpaced by the cost of living.\\n\\nVery insightful video. \"Live below your means and have an emergency fund\"\\n*cries in zoomer* @KuraIthys You need to adjust what basic requirements of living actually mean. Live with your parents or a lot of roommates. Even minimum wage easily covers food and housing in that case. @Maden Smith I actually think we should doing this in the US! @LarryM in comparison, it\\'s more like low-risk, low-reward. Except that the low-reward is much, much higher than what people would achieve if they keep living a financially illiterate life.\\n\\nEdit: it at least helped introduce me into the world of finance and got me motivated to stop living like the 70% of Americans who can\\'t cover a $1000 emergency. Sort of like a gateway; a starting point. Q0ET9U it‚Äôs called inflation. It eats up the value of money. It‚Äôs probably the single largest scale factor in real estate prices @Arian Behnami screw Dave Ramsey unless you are like 50k in debt. His policies are not meant for long term success just long term mediocrity after you get out of debt. Man, that whole \"People are living beyond their means\" comment hurt.\\nCause it does feel genuinely disconnected when the system is set up so that \"Beyond your means\" is a small apartment and food security for so many people. We need to move to actually help people now, or people are going to be pushed to breaking point and we\\'ve seen where that leads. My favourite recovery is the L shaped recovery. Or as we say in the industry: The economy taking a big L. Also known as the Japan Economy. Ê≠ª-shaped recovery:\\n\\nYou are already dead. üòÇ welcome to the great depression 2.0 : electric boogaloo. How may I serve ya?

Oh hey, spend your money on our sponsor\" Any person who prospers off human misery isn\\'t a \"a savy capitalist\", they\\'re just a parasite Plenty of people don\\'t even have retirement savings, homes, or cars. So... Something that‚Äôs extremely scary is that in America about 70% of people are living paycheck to paycheck, which leaves them very little to no room to invest in themselves or take advantage of the coming crisis. If inflation sets in from all the QE down the road, there will be a drastic decrease in standards of living at best. Nows the time to invest in a Roth IRA. MASSIVE taxes are coming @Orange Soda So if a shark is coming for you, are you just gonna float there and do nothing or are you gonna at least swim for it?\\nJust because the corporation or whatever could be the root of a larger problem doesn\\'t mean individuals should not attempt self help and are free from blame no matter what.\\nAnd that\\'s the problem with a lot of people, they tend to put all the blame on an external entity. In reality, problems tend to be a composition of a number of components, some of which belonging to the individual. \\nNow, the composition would differ from people to people for 20% or maybe 30% of the people, it could actually be almost entirely external. But the other 40-50%, at least part of it is themselves. So while I\\'d never say something like \"they have no one to blame but themselves\", because that\\'s not true, saying that it is not at all self-inflicted would also not be true. For most of the paycheck to paycheck people, maybe the corporation handed them the knife, but they cut themselves with it. @GmaerGabe - You know nothing, Jon Snow. The Louster its only 230 million people in 7.7 billion people worldwide, look at china and India and think again It‚Äôs already started to happen...a lot of peoples are homeless now. O shaped recovery:\\nWhen nobody know is it good or bad. But because of the fear we think that there is nothing to hope for Pessimists: L shaped recovery. \"Mom can we have V?\"\\nMom: No, we have V at home\\nV at home: K Too much advertising. I love how this channel pretends that the US government actually tries to have stimulus spending affect the common man. Give me a break, they gave bread crumbs to the masses, and socialized the losses from the richest people and companies.\\n\\nEDIT: They view it as a \"moral problem\" to give money to the poor masses. However, at the same time, they view it as obvious that they have to bail out the largest companies. @p0xus aww it was an interesting conversation. @Lord Jaraxxus Your hopeless. Im done. @p0xus i was unclear about it before, in a ubi economy, the rich will get richer beyond what anyone on ubi person could ever dream of. The rich are the ones offering services the people on ubi want but some they would never afford while the rich can keep pricing the poor out of it. you want a house? 2 million dollars. but we will rent it out for 500 a month. \\nThen for the move money out. They can just leave the country, revoke their citizenship and become a citizen of another smaller country before losing their money to dumb tax policy. There would be a transition time before said tax is put in place and in that time the rich will make sure their money is off shore before the tax raise is done. \\nAlso the rich already pay more taxes for the least benefit. Don\\'t bite the hand that feeds you or else they will leave. \\nTLDR: ubi will end up into the rich pockets and too much taxes, rich leave. @Lord Jaraxxus \"the rich got richer and the middle/poor stayed the same\"\\n\\nThe rich did get richer; but everyone else did not stay the same. Their wages did, while things like housing increased in price. That means they got poorer. \\n\\n\" the rich would invest the money in things that can cross borders with little trouble like art or boats and send it off to another country and/or deposit it offshore\"\\n\\nThe time old argument of \"They will just hide the money!\". They pay as little as they can in taxes anyway. If they can get by with paying nothing, they do. Period. Full stop. If they can hide money and not pay taxes on it, they do. If they can lower taxes on certain types of income, they do. And then they get paid almost exclusively in that type of income. Yet another argument from you that doesn\\'t actually hold water when you look at the real world. @p0xus if you also look to back then, the rich got richer and the middle/poor stayed the same. before you say taxes would fix this, the rich would invest the money in things that can cross borders with little trouble like art or boats and send it off to another country and/or deposit it offshore. 17:00  now that\\'s something i never understood about US and most western countries: 18 and you get the boot\\n\\nthat makes no sense, it goes both ways. if you kick your children out when they literally need you most... whats gonna happen when you old and can\\'t do most things? Prior generations of parents have had Social Security are Retirement plans from their jobs to fall back on, so they were allowed to kick the children out without penalty. Run that system across three or four generations and it becomes the standard and going back to the normality that existed before the rise of programs like Social Security (and the private sector competition like retirement plans) seems ridiculous. @Blue Mountain that\\'s never how i felt when talking to my friends from there, and i read a few cases of people literally coming home and finding all thier stuff in boxes 18 isn\\'t when a child needs their parents the most. Also you don\\'t just get the boot at 18, at least not is most cases. Most move out and become semi-independent in their early 20s and then fully independent by mid 20s @khhnator sorry I should have been a bit more clear, I was agreeing with your original comment. @Gareth Baus well you did not specify what was a good move :D This all depends on the assumption that there IS going to be a recovery. I\\'m betting on a collapse-of-this-disgusting-system-of-capitalism recovery and an implosion of the vampire state. 16:31 South Korea has a high savings rate but it also has very high short term consumer debt (credit cards). They are more of a hybrid between East and West. I would guess that the younger generations are barely saving anything. live below your means is nearly impossible when you consider the cost of housing in the USA and the average salaries. \\n\\nThe reality is that multi generation housing is going to become more normal real soon. Everybody out here like: \"minimum wage\"\\nI\\'m here like: \"heh, trade school go BRRRRRRRR\" @ReubMann almost every high school has a trade school they can go to, at least in the US. In certain states the state might also pay for the expenses of trade schools if you graduate highschool like Tennessee. how did you learn about Trade school?

Mate, I love your videos, but...\\nThis is how every recovery occurs. Wage earners suffer cuts and asset prices fall - because that is exactly how profit rates rise! It is a necessary evil for a recovery in investment to ever occur, not something unusual or unfair that governments should remedy. It is politically irresponsible to pedal this narrative, making people expect that a recovery can occur without raising returns to asset-owners. Only a Keynesian who has forgotten the importance of real wages would miss this; even though this kind of thinking is the basis of Keynesianism! After all, it is only because stimulus raises revenues relative to wages, in traditional Keynesian thinking, that it is stimulatory to investment. Falling input and asset prices, including wage rates, is merely stimulating investment by lowering real costs relative to constant or falling revenues - but both methods affect real output, inequality of incomes and long-term real wage growth in identical manners. Economic reality has to be acknowledged; even Labor prime minister Keating understood this dynamic to some extent. I think the correct spelling is \"Que\"\\nThe question is will it be a recovery, or recession after kicking the can down the road with huge amounts of stimulus.

All the cars we have are from before 2005 and she is fervently against owning real estate. She‚Äôs lived frugally and had the luxury of keeping a decent paying job, but still has no money saved or assets. An aversion to spending is not what an economy is supposed to create, especially those in the ‚Äòmiddle class‚Äô. You will never build wealth by saving money. But you can spend yourself into poverty. It‚Äôs very one sided. @B He The problem is that those low interest rates which predate 2008 to sometime in the 90\\'s and helped subsidise wage stagnation. Any major raise now will sick the USA economy into a depression that is likely to wipe out the middle class and a massive chunk of the finance sector. The people who get to buy the massively deflated assets that go on fire sale will be the very rich who have been sitting on massive piles of cash for a decade. The is is the economic stagflation nightmare as masses of business capital moves into non-productive assets like real estate.\\n\\nThis will certainly correct things for the next generation to come but it will kill millions of people in the process. It may also threaten the USA\\'s hegemonic global power which will almost guarantee a world war regardless of which party is in power at the time. The foundation of the USA\\'s nation security capability is world domination and any threat to that is the road to war. There is nothing the USA government will not do to maintain its position at the top. Yeah, aversion to spending causes a bubble economy (I think that\\'s what its called) no spending means the market suffers and as the market suffers the people spend less which hurts the market more. \\u200b@Justin Okraski \\n There are two economies. The capital/financial economy, and the real economy where actual goods/services are exchanged and produced. Many folks believe that the real economy drives the financial and capital markets. \\n\\n In reality, it is the opposite. The Federal Reserve knows this, and they\\'ve kept rates so low for so long after 2008 that they were unable to normalize and shrink their balance sheet. We have artificially low interest rates controlled by the central banks. For the betterment of our economy, rates actually need to rise, and all of the malinvestment and mismanagement will then be allowed to be corrected. \\n\\n The scale of that correction is going to lead to business failure, job loss, and other economic extremities. But you know what? It is the bitter pill we need to swallow before we find ourselves unable to find a willing seller of real goods and services due to our extreme debts.  \\n\\r\\n\\n There are two options. Default, or inflate. The Fed will inflate. The result is higher prices and costs. Well it does sound like your mom has a sober view of her finances. She\\'s buying cars on the schedule her finances allow, rather than the what the car dealers allow. Now that she\\'s paid off debt she should be poised to build assets.

Man now I feel so stupid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsRKY_SFkU0&t=1s Goddamn man that was a shocker @MegaVikingen fuck, everyone\\'s gonna go super Saiyan Man comments first thing said on video in desperate attempt to get likes. Fr though, they\\'re developing a vaccine for the virus and I hear Leonardo DiCaprio is the head scientist in the lab, so we dont need to worry @Rustin Stardust source? @Rustin Stardust it\\'s been 2 months With Hollywood magic like that, we might just get the vaccine in a month like Trump says... ü§£ I don‚Äôt think Leonardo DiCaprio would go to that extent to avoid the virus ‚ÄúHi, girlfriend‚Äù -Leonardo DiCaprio, 1254, bce I‚Äôd love to see a partnership between them and Leonardo Di Caprio Why is fairbairn the most Aussie sounding thing ever Well, if you havent noticed, they are australians.. @Wavemaninawe or should i say nah yeah @Wavemaninawe yeah nah I would argue that \\'ye na\\' is the most Aussie sounding thing ever. I always thought it\\'s like a mix between Farnham and Barnes... L[he]onardo D[hit]i Capr[her]io\\nSo deep :‚Äô( Dhiti lol Please No If you think saying ‚Äúhi girlfriend‚Äù into your phone is pathetic I‚Äôll let you know that there‚Äôs this guy in my P.E class who does that but into a badminton racket A lot of people don\\'t know this but I am actually Leonardo DiCaprio. oh shit stop complaining about the environment while you\\'re chilling on your yacht and flying with a private jet 50 times a year around the world Can\\'t wait for the Coronavirus movie in a few years\\n\\n\\nHopefully it\\'ll earn Leonardo DiCaprio his next Oscar for literally eating a bat Meanwhile everybody in Australia panic buying toilet paper smh @hells onion SARS has a fatality rate of about 15%, whereas corona is sitting at about 3-4%. Think about population age percentages* the median age in mainland Australia is 37, with those over 85 at roughly 4-5% of the total population. The elderly and those of compromised health i.e autoimmune diseases and secondary illnesses are the ones at-risk, it\\'s important to note that this demographic is at risk from approximately everything; old age will do that to you. \\nThe coronavirus\\'s real threat is mass hysteria. Look at how quickly people have jumped on the toiletpaper and sanitiser bandwagon, with no discernible logic or practical self preservation.   According to the CDC, soap and warm water are better at preventing disease than hand sanitizer in many ways**. If we keep this dumb shit up, some seriously life threating political agendas may be triggered, I think the real threat of the corona virus is as an economic and political weapon for opportunistic greed-bois. \\n\\n*https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/1CD2B1952AFC5E7ACA257298000F2E76?OpenDocument\\n\\n**https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html @Falafel Bratan plenty of intelligence Falafel..

Show me the curvature.. Hey kid, trust me, it\\'s all bullshit what they teach you in school. They had me fooled for a long time as well ChainsawBlue 36 our Costco‚Äôs and sams here in Hawaii have a limit of 2 rolls in per card I have sent this to Leonardo Di Caprio so that he knows how to avoid coronavirus Everyone tryna get rid of the virus\\n\\n\\nMe: I just want school to be shut for 2 months You\\'d have to do online school, which sucks. Taking online classes in college is one thing, but having to do it for more than 3 classes is killer. I wouldn\\'t be able to do it. Yeah I\\'m an introvert and just want to play Xbox for two months. I‚Äôm a senior though. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to graduate. I don‚Äôt want school to be shut down at all. Nooooo cuz I want to finish my exams and get em over with :((( Wolfie Editz or nonexistent. PA(my state) has a law that requires 180 days of school 3:01\\n\\n‚ÄúJust say it‚Äù\\n‚ÄúNah coz I wanna say it‚Äù\\n\\nYeah alright bro Jaxon: step four\\nAlso jaxon: **holds up five fingers** Fun fact: ever since the outbreak of the coronavirus, the sales of the Corona brand beer have dropped a substantial percentage. I cant believe Leonardo DiCaprio would let this happen I died laughing when I saw that on Twitter @M Boy wheres your source? You\\'re FoS. Yes I do agree with all of you guys comments however if you continue reading this comment even when you don\\'t even want to anymore and realize it\\'s just a bunch of text that tells you nothing of importance blabablaba bla blablabla Leonardo DiCaprio bla blablabla bla blabla so there you go. Always read through every comment really carefully. another fun fact icelandic people seemed to want Corona Beer more after the outbreak.. so sale have risen at least there Michael Johansson in belgium they have a 2 for 1 deal where if you buy 2 coronas you get a popular belgian drink and its name translates to sudden death, the belgians do have some good humour When you watch Titanic but Leonardo DiCaprio has coronavirus it doesn\\'t make sense: How do you catch the coronavirus when really it is catching you? Leonardo di caprio: tom Hanks has coronavirus. \\nEveryone else: leonardo di capiro how did you get here?

I was just thinking this same thing Hahaha thank you Kelly!!! I laughed out loud with the cat intermission. I really wanted to adopt a Great Pyrenees and my husband wanted a cat. So we compromised and adopted a black cat. Lol. I thought I was a dog person but my cat has taught me I\\'m an animal person. I absolutely know why it\\'s called the cat walk in the fashion world now. I swear my cat would put any super model to shame. Your cat is gorgeous and I really love getting to see her/him. Um... Also I love the items you showed. Lol. I did watch all of the video.

We accidentally adopted her on black cat appreciation day. We didn\\'t know that was a thing and walked into petsmart hoping they would have a black cat and they did!! Lots of them! Lol. I saw Catterina and said to my husband \"I want that one. She\\'s perfect!\" And when we got to sit with her she claimed us. She felt the same way I did. Now she sits next to me while I take calls for work and I just love her. üíñüíñüíñ wendy spiesman  I‚Äôve had two black cats ...both thought they were SupermodelsüòÅ Love that top Shea.

At least we\\'ll look fabulous with no money.. üòÇ While I\\'m having stomachache caused by anxiety from whole this situation, uncertainty about future, my job, finance, etc, getting stuck in the house with 2 little  boys, still watch your video.

I\\'ll shop and play in my own closet, wear stuff in the house that might make someone else look aghast at me, and smile all the way.  :)  There\\'s nothing wrong with wanting a bit of a different head space away from the spreading anxiety.  :)  All the best, Shannon A. Very out of touch! You can still wear dresses.  Looking nice and feeling good about yourself have not been canceled! Beverlyhillsprincess I guess she missed the memo! Gotta get those kick backs!

Shea is just always such a beautiful, classy, lady. The type of lady I aspire to be like <3 Loving this hair so much on you! This was the first time in my life that I spent a good chunk of money on my wardrobe all at once. I usually only buy what is necessary and spread it out over several months. Then the virus hit and I have no place to wear most of it. Luckily all the pieces will work for summer as well. I also decided to try on everything and make up different looks depending on the future occasion and then photograph each outfit. I\\'ll keep an album on my phone to refer back so when something does come up I can decide more easily. It will provide a way to keep me busy for an entire few days while also allowing me the joy of trying everything on. Great way of looking at things, Mrs. Little!  :)  There are still ways to enjoy what we bought/have - why not?!   All the best, Shannon A.  :) You look so pretty in this top!! Thank you for distracting us from this COVID-19. Take care Love the wide-leg pants and jeans. Of course, at age 61, I have worn this style several times over the years as fashion styles come & go, again & again.i  definitely think you need to wear a shirt that is more tailored or fitted, to show your shape. Wearing tops that are more flow-y or loose with wide leg pants will make even the most toned or thin person look ‚Äòbig.‚Äô Thanks for the upbeat videos Shae! You have good advice & instincts and I truly appreciate your positive attitude. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Love the kitty intermission üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è It is so truly relaxing & interesting to watch you! üíóYes I am here for the new Spring Outfit Ideas!

Wild. @Greatcoolman2 it\\'s just not the same game @Greatcoolman2 64 DS is amazing but we all know it being on a DS holds it back @Lecsan Seow No @Star Wars Is Life it wasn\\'t that bad Sad We need MG2!! Umm it says on the website that its a update same with odessy @Stacy Freeman I still want coop in 64 via a patch or something I know it\\'s a pipe dream but still it sounds like alot of fun. if you look theres arrows at the bottom of the game select screen METAL GEAR!? Metal Gear!? Nintendo: ‚ÄúWe played Super Mario 3D All Stars‚Äù\\n\\nYes Nintendo, yes you did It was all actually a dream Nintendo says and the game was never made or coming out Oh those darn Nintendo people and their easy early access to Nintendo games! It would‚Äôve been troublesome if they didn‚Äôt. Never played sunshine, so let‚Äôs change that in 6 days Me too man I didn‚Äôt play it kjellywood well, I own a GameCube but I don‚Äôt have sunshine on it. Duuuuh its gamecube i played only luigis mansion on 3ds and mario kart double dash on an emulator on pc almost every gamecube game is from 2003 and thats the year when im born i always wanted to play mario kart double dash and it finnaly happend to me and super star saga is from 2003 also but thats gba i got both version gba and 3ds but gamecube is always be the console i almost never played but im glad nintendo switch players can play sunshine im happy for you GoGoLuner I think you mean 1 hour and 39 minutes I think you mean in 3hours and 24 mins Alternate title: nintendo rates their own game ‚ÄúIt MIGHT be biased considering we sold and created it but I give it 5/5‚Äù Hey Nintendo, my mom said it‚Äôs my turn to play, so hand it over right now. Funny how this got 64 likes @Rodian_SkyPyratz I pre ordered the Digital Copy Luke Vlogs I preordered the physical copy. @Rodian_SkyPyratz  the physical copy comes out Friday the digital comes out Thursday in USA Squid Jenkins No. I‚Äôm in America. \"Super Mario Sunshine Is the most different Mario game ever.\"\\n\\nMario Galaxy: \"Excuse me?\" I played SMG when everyone played it on the Wii. @Jakitron Sunshine Don\\'t Got A Jetpack Either, It Do Be Having F.L.U.D.D Tho @Jakitron Nope Does Mario Galaxy have a jetpack? (I\\'m actually asking, never played it) 0:21 with the galaxy 2 music, okay Nintendo, cheers for acknowledging you missed 2 out üò≠üò≠ Better come out when these 3 are inevitably sold separately on April 1st as a 4th @Silly Skeleton still you could appreciate that they at least tried putting mg2 on there and still nintendo is a company after all @master ims Nah, they wouldn\\'t do that. The industry standard is $60 for a new release and I don\\'t think Nintendo has ever budged from that price point for a first party Switch game. @Silly Skeleton this was the beta days so it could have had a diffirent price let say 80 dollars @master ims That\\'s a pretty weak excuse to drop a game from the collection and still charge full price. They didnt miss it it was in the beta of the game but didnt put cause they couldnt optimize the controls since mg2 is harder than mg1 Nintendo after replaying the same clip with a slo-mo effect: I have achieved *gen z humor* Ryan Conner .. Silence, brand repeating something that isn‚Äôt funny slower isn‚Äôt funny It\\'s better then what the boomers usually come up with .... The editing is so random I thought this was a YTP. Mr Salty \\nYeah It looks like a bad and unfunny YTP Lol they\\'re trying to create more hype Lol they\\'re doing their job @Ryan Conner ik right. its just so annoying. dang. I hate when literally anybody is doing the work they\\'re paid for. It‚Äôs working üò≠üò≠üò≠ So they\\'re doing their job ? \"Super Mario Offense #1\" was the only time I\\'ve ever laughed at one of these videos I like how they are talking about these games like they just got released but have been out for decades. @SirSinclair I know Believe it or not A lot of people have never actually played them they kinda are, i mean, its new on the switch. Chip Corley This was the whole point Nintendo: *we played the game that we made!*\\n\\nIdk I get what they\\'re saying but I just find it funny üòÜ\\n\\nNext up: \"we played Pokemon!\" -gamefreak Nintendo played with themselves Oh hey its that guy that I am subbed to (: These people aren‚Äôt apart of Nintendo, more a part of Nintendo‚Äôs youtube channel. They get to play these games because of being in the channel. They didn\\'t even play the game lmao, Nintendo sheep eating this crap up like the goodboy consumers they are. 900th like Nobody: We PLaYeD MarIO 3d AlL StaRS\\n\\nNintendo minute: Talk about Mario 3d all stars We Played Super Mario 3D All-Stars!\\n\"But you didn\\'t.\" I already pre-ordered the game, it will be my first time playing Sunshine, I\\'M SO EXCITED :D @Oshabot 16 Emm... Hola?? Hola taco That game is one of the first games I ever played The first game I beat was super Mario land on Gameboy in 1994. I got stuck on the last boss for 6 months. I beat Duke nukem 2 after that. Same I got 64 for the Wii U eShop and got galaxy short after the Wii I got the Wii The fact that nintendo could be doing a Mario Galaxy 3 is what keeps me living Super Mario Universe motor78 it may be similar, but I find them like two different stories and branches Odyssey IS Galaxy 3 \"We Play Super Mario 3D All Stars\"\\n\\nShows like 30 seconds total in gameplay It‚Äôs the same games you‚Äôve played 10 years ago lol Yoshikage Kira fair point they should just watch a let‚Äôs play Yoshikage Kira true Cifu SSB. IKR lol cubemaster 34 ikr 7:06 \"I definitely didn\\'t think he\\'d be going to space.\" He went to space twice. We need Super Mario Galaxy 2 in a second collection. The hunt for the green stars was true challenging fun. Plus playing through the game again as Luigi proved he CAN reach greater heights than his brother. Jumping higher, but with a little less control is just his style. A true accomplishment for the man in green. AND 3D Land! Don\\'t forget about it! 0:20 Galaxy 2 power star theme exactly !! I already played all of the Mario games, so I\\'m going to play them in order of release. 1:20, he says that like he had just recently learned how to pronounce it right BATT-L ... FIELD lmaooo Alternative title: We talk about Super Mario 3D All Stars @Spaceman Alph Yep First time to. Also rip pre order. No more amazon Mazin Osman Stop linking this time stamp, there isn‚Äôt any actual ‚Äúgame *play* ‚Äú its just a still shot of Mario sleeping. And considering how he only shows it for three seconds in an eight minute video it‚Äôs definitely clickbait @Aaron Collis Me too just played sm 64 and galaxy but never got a game cube which I regret today but I am excited for sunshine I‚Äôm gonna play sunshine for the first time Nintendo thanos snapped Mario Galaxy 2 out of existence. 3:37 Krysta: Super Mario Sunshine is the Most Unique Mario Game\\n\\nDr.Mario: Hold My Beer The closest I\\'ve gotten to playing this all stars collection early, like _very_ early in fact, is Super Mario 63. \"It\\'s a spoiler, we can\\'t say it.\"\\n\"That\\'s not true.. :(\" ‚ÄúI never owned a Nintendo 64‚Äù\\n-someone 10 seconds away from disaster @That1Flamingo the wii sure is a wonderful console, not only can you play any gamecube game on it, but it possesed probably the largest selection of legacy content on nintendo hardware to date @ayman aboufarise i had to miss out sadly, but i was able to use the virtual console on the wii I never owned one also. I was young. SMM2 MickeyInk sane, too bad there‚Äôs no reason to own any of those in a few days Super Mario 64 DS Version is the Best.

And we have been robbed of the Backwards Long Jump in SM64, F in the chat y\\'all. When I was younger my favorite video game was Super Mario 64 DS. It will be the firs I will play ant it\\'ll be my first time with the original graphics.\\n\\nI\\'ve never played sunshine nor galaxy but I\\'m sure they will be awesome. We played 3d all stars! \\nEnds up just talking about the game and showing the gameplay from trailers What did you expect pal? It\\'s a review video. I\\'m beyond excited for these 3 games! Mario 64 is one of the most nostalgic meaningful games I\\'ve ever played!!!! Can\\'t wait for this! what r u doing here :o @TriggerSpark lol wow only a limited time releae @Kamui Dragon Hardwell & MAKJ - Countdown (Lyrics) : \\r\\n[Starting Beat]\\r\\nTen\\r\\nNine\\r\\nEight\\r\\nSeven \\r\\nSix\\r\\nFive\\r\\nFour\\r\\nThree\\r\\nTwo\\r\\nAre you ready\\r\\n\\r\\n[Drop]\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you ready \\r\\n\\r\\n[Melody]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Build Up]\\r\\nTen\\r\\nNine\\r\\nEight\\r\\nSeven \\r\\nSix\\r\\nFive\\r\\nFour\\r\\nThree\\r\\nTwo\\r\\nAre you ready\\r\\n\\r\\n[Drop]\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you ready Super Mario Galaxy has to be in the top 3 Mario games ever made! Note: \"Played\" is a past-tense word, so the title of this video still rings true. I‚Äôm starting chronologically with Super Mario 64! Nintendo: We\\'re playing our own game!\\n\\nNintendoü•á   üëà Nintendo I‚Äôm going to be playing all of them for the first time going in chronological order. Can‚Äôt wait üòù Krysta: \"Oh! Is he sleeping? That\\'s my favorite part of the game- ( *I love it when he sleeps, he\\'s so cute! Shhh!* ) Uh- *tIrEd* ! #50 on Trending for Gaming\\n\\nSonic\\'s voice: Phew, just made it Nintendo: well I guess now is the time to get all those ps1 kids from the nineties playing super mario 64 and sunshine Never played any of these games. Can‚Äôt wait! Nintendo‚Äôs gaming confession: we got rid of the one of the most defining mechanics of the game because it makes us look like bad programmers, the BLJ! This is my first time playing all these games! My first console was my switch! I can‚Äôt wait for this and 3D world. I played 3D world at my cousins before and I really loved it! This is actually really cool,please release the outtro fully. Also why is saying Fludd name a spolier? Also also,why did they play the game? \"I\\'ve never owned a N64 so I never really played Super Mario 64\". Well, you could have played it on the DS (or 3DS). The DS version of it was totally great. Almost a totally different experience, though, so not quite the same. This a just one of like one million ways to flex that they got this early, Member perks :/ And show us very little about the actual menu. üòî ThePikachuKing I dont know if pokemon is so good Anonymous Idea I guess I got mixed up there, I meant 3D allstars. @Dylan Lindsay well the animal crossing switch is still $500 and there\\'s still mostly stupid prices for this. It might be better only because there are still preorders available 2:08 - shhhh... he‚Äôs precious and he needs his sleep. \"personality never seen before in a mario game\" so that\\'s it huh, we\\'re just gonna ignore all mario rpg games. Shame Super Mario 64 didn‚Äôt get the 16:9 treatment. OHHHHHH MY GOD MY MONEY IS READY. I‚Äôm only here for the gameplay idc about the commentary. Love this game. Definitely gonna buy it. ah yes, my favourite mechanic in mario sunshine FLUDD, also known as Fun Luxurius Ultimate Doggy Door\\n(4:47) Ohh boy!will be playing ‚Äúgalaxy‚Äùfor the first timeü§≠and finishing sunshine for the first time. We pretend to play Super Mario 3D All-Stars. @Micha - yeah they are. If you say ‚ÄúSuper Mario Galaxy‚Äù is my favorite game, that is an opinion @Riley Freedman Because these aren\\'t opinions! @Micha - yeah but you kept straight up saying they weren‚Äôt opinions @Riley Freedman you do know this is called marketing right? lol The game has no graphics changes! They want us for the same game, probably more expensive! @3:28 WOOOOOH!!! LETS GO BABY!!!! I\\'ve never played them...  they remind me of Oddessy so they look fun Odyssey was deemed as the Spiritual successor to Super Mario 64, so you\\'ll be in for a treat. Playing them in order. I‚Äôve played them all but my 5 yo son will be experiencing them for the first time. Gay Bowser: Who are you?\\nBi Bowser: I\\'m you but better More like worse Totally lost here lol The virgin Bowsette vs the chad Bowser Michael Deypalubos No @Boltizar LMAOOOO godlike reply 4:42 D. Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device! I played Sunshine when I was a kid and I still remember it! Imagine beeing in a pokemon battle against mario and he is like: \"Fine Luigi use Dirty Dishes!\"\\nAnd your Arceus gets completely destroyed by a dirty dieses throwing luigi. Man I‚Äôm excited to play this great collection epic deal in my opinion For some reason, when I was watching this episode, I felt Krysta was about to burst into tears throughout the video, several times. Hope all is well with her. Please just show us the Bowser fight.\\n\\nWe all want to know Bowser\\'s sexuality. @ACE SAMM\\nDude, chill out.\\nIt\\'s just a joke.\\nEveryone knows that Mario says \"So long, kinga Bowser!\" but the sound compression made it sound \"So long, gay Bowser!\"\\nAnd now he says \"Bye-bye\", people are just joking about the fact that it sounds similar to \"Bu-bi\".\\nAlso, \"Weird message in kids games\", even IF Mario actually says \"So long, gay Bowser!\" I don\\'t think this could cause problems for some kids.\\nEven because in one of the first Kirby games, can\\'t remember which one, there were some blocks that have the form of...  ehm, yeah.\\nThis Mario things are actually funny, there are other games like Kirby that time where maybe it\\'s not a nice secret (and Gygas).\\nHowever this Gay and Bi Bowser thing is just a meme, a joke.\\nYou can\\'t tell this is a \"Weird message in kid games\" and disrespect like this people that enjoys this jokes. It uses Shindou, so no gay Bowser. Nah. No way bruh. No way I want to know that in A GAME AIMED FOR ALL AGES!!! eri_noemi I was going to SAY, ‚ÄúFinally, someone with common sense!!!‚Äù But that last comment basically makes me say, ‚Äúoh wait, you like weird jokes in kids games too? Well... never mind...‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry, but. That is how I roll. Cintr√≥n Productions no. That‚Äôs a dumb and crazy idea. Never owned a nintendo 64 literally children have n64s Not everyone does. I don\\'t. Nintendo: We played the new game!\\nMe: Okay, can I see some footage?\\nNintendo: It\\'s a review.\\nMe: Why didn\\'t you say so? Yo I want \"l is real 2401\" sign in HD please Actually, contrary to popular belief it actually says eternal star (same sign is also used in the original ocarina of time) someone upscaled it to their best ability and it says eternal star. What\\'s weird though is that despite that, luigi was found in the games source code exactly 24 years and 1 month after 64\\'s release. It‚Äôll be my first time playing 64 and Sunshine, I‚Äôm so excited! I notice a severe lack of:\\n-Galaxy 2\\n-Gay Bowser And BLJ @Batman lel Bro if that were really the case then props to Nintendo. I was hoping they\\'d add Galaxy 2 later as DLC. Gay bowser>anything else He\\'s now \"Bye bi.\" Ricardo Rodriguez you can see how it looks at 2:07. the screen is a bit wider than the n64 version ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine let the temp edit the video, it‚Äôs not like they will use assets from games that are not in the collection...‚Äù lol\\n0:21 Cant wait to Lets Play this Legendary Games again or better to play them again! üëçüèª‚ù§ What I love so so much about this package is that it excludes the amateur sell-out game; Odyssey.\\n\\nOnly 3 of the *Best Ever* allowed, thanks # confirmed by Nintendo themselves!! üëç When I see Mario galaxy I get flashbacks of me having a really good time when I was 7 *when you get clickbaited by Nintendo themselves* @Big Boss They were reviewing it the whole time. They didn\\'t do a good job at it, but that\\'s what it was supposed to be. Kosmid I did read the title...We played 3D All-Stars? Where‚Äôs the review part? It‚Äôs been 6 minutes trying to find it but I can‚Äôt. How many times do I have to comment this? It is a review video. I\\'m sorry you were expect a gameplay video or some crap, but this is purely a review of the game. Read the title right, and take the video for what it is. Lol ikr!! Roman Torchic I guess they meant it for Nintendo ‚ÄúMinute‚Äù üòÜ Heard a lot of good things about Sunshine before, really excited to play it. üòÇüòÇ I was really hoping to hear about how they\\'ve converted the motion controls from the Wii remote to handheld Switch mode for Galaxy, but I guess we\\'ll all find out how that works when it releases on the 18th hahaha It will be the first time that I‚Äôam going to play super Mario sunshine and I hope that I will like playing the game üòÅ \"Excitement intensifies\" it will be my first time playing all of them \"We show trailer bits and talk about the games instead of playing them\" The video is NOT clickbait. It\\'s a review of the game, not a gameplay videos. It\\'s called \"We Played 3d All Stars\" not \"We are playing 3d All Stars\". at least they showed the menu, i was wondering ab that THANK YOU, yeah this video is just bad. Almost clickbait. 2:10 @Stop Misandry and Gynocentrism its like she\\'s never reviewed a game before and instead of focusing on actual features she just calls it cute and fun for the whole video Nintendo: We played our own game!\\nMe I sure hope you did! my switch destroyed i wish some get a new one ): I\\'ve never played SM Galaxy, I\\'m over hyped for this game. Gaming confession of mine: never owned the original DS, never owned the Wii and the WiiU. So, yeah üòÖ -we played 3d allstars!- \\nwe talked about our backstories to the games in 3d allstars! Am I the only that just wanted to see the menu screen of 3D Allstars Wow I am surprised this much people also wanted to see the menu screen, thanks for the likes and comments :) No AlanE14 THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN WANDERING THIS WHOLE TIME I honestly wanted to as well No Managed to get a pre order for this finally, VERY excited YouTube Gamers: \"We got more Super Mario 3D All-Stars footage on Nintendo Minute!\"\\nNintendo Minute has never been so relevant Geez why couldn\\'t they increase the internal aspect ratio with sm64. Not hard to do. There are two games that will always have a special place in my heart: Mario galaxy, and skyward sword. The fact that they were able to transfer the controls for galaxy to the switch makes me 99% sure that skyward sword will be coming next year for Zelda‚Äôs 35th! March 31st be like\\n\"We don\\'t play Super Mario 3d All-Stars\" @Deadsea1993 Gaming damn, never seen someone that really didn\\'t like anything about PS or Xbox Galaxy 2: First time? It Wont Go Away Then You Just Cant Buy Then @S . Yeah, but you know scalpers will eat it up and it will be hard to find cause 3D World has been the most requested Wii U port for awhile and it is the one I\\'ve missed the most. As for money, I\\'m not rich. I just worked a lot at a car factory and put in lots of overtime cause I enjoyed the work. I\\'d put stuff like The Isley Brothers on the radio and start building the brakes. @Deadsea1993 Gaming 3D World isn\\'t limited to March 31st. I wish I had that kind of money lol. Every time I here mario I always think of his voice actor just saying it. 0:37 sounds like it would fit in an rpg ',\n",

I\\'m as picky and snobby as all get out, and loved this. She\\'s actually gotten so much better at dancing wow her stage presence has definitely improved Just Stating Facts and we see you over there on the internet, comparing all the girls who are killing it, but we figured you out, we all know now we all got crowns, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN KC Orphan yeah her plain face expressions kill me. She doesn‚Äôt know how to handle a camera or how to flirt with the camera. She is probably a transgender male. I think they took out a lot of footwork and gave her like kpop hand gestures more than actual dancing so she can focus more on the song. The good thing is that they know she can\\'t dance so they toss actual line dancers to distract from the fact that she barely moves.\\nIt\\'s a good thing that her choreographer knows her strengths, and are adapting her style to compensate, so the simplification makes her look better by comparison. \\nThat sounds like a criticism, so before anyone bites my head off, she probably has improved in dancing after some practice, but it\\'s not really her forte. Simplified choreography and dancers to fill the space around her is actually quite clever to make her seem more involved in the music. \\nIf I had any criticism of the video it would be the strange dead eyed center look to camera she keeps giving while she sings. \\nI can get past a good singer not being a great dancer, but the empty expression with barely moving lips thing does kind of weird me out. I need your support and opinions about my videos thank you all I love musicüíï Just imagine how many people are listening to this song with you right now. smd Ooo- Canculated almost 200 peoples. @ali √∂zkan doesn\\'t matter @Ediineen *_* ƒ± dont understand you One of the best pop albums in my lifetime as a 32 year old. Dua Lipa is the real deal, huge powerful presence on the stage that\\'s subdued at the same time. Excellent voice and an amazing use of empowering women. What a fucking amazing person. Who else came here from Elle Black Pink Song Association ?

Most sales now a days are digital. And no one else is releasing music currently. Everyone is home and online.

But honestly, please...\\r I need to know if I really so bad at it üò¢ I should have stayed at home Why is nobody talking about how good the transition is? Is it me or they have almost the same rhythm as Another One Bites the Dust of the band QUEEN, I still love this song It does, it\\'s called sampling Anyone who watches anime could relate to this song because of the characters (example: me with Bakugo or who ever you like) or maybe it‚Äôs just me Life‚Äôs too short to pretend you don‚Äôt like Dua Lipa.

To ten Polski komentarz kt√≥rego szukasz üòÅüòÅ Not so popular comment: i kinda like 2020... I mean look at this... and so many other phenomenal songs... it\\'s growth... it\\'s literally \\'renaissance\\' She\\'s saving the pop industry by bringing these 80s elements to her songs. It\\'s like she\\'s creating something unique and nostalgic at the same time. Well, the album\\'s gonna be called \"Future Nostalgia\" so totally makes sense. Genius woman you are, Dua!. its prod by actual producer who make soup hit radio and u forgot the song after 2 weeks This particular song is more disco inspired than it is 80s inspired. Listen to the basslines, the top synth, and the transitions. All disco techniques. That\\'s definitely pre-80s. Carmel Maria who‚Äôs that‚Äôs ? Lol üòÇ Million times agree with you! ‚ô• she s look controled by a producer or merketing director, nothing is natural queen called. they want their riff back Any people who\\'s hearts are broken????

They made the song, then after they realized how similar it sounded to INXS. They only gave INXS writing credits so they wouldn‚Äôt get sued or whatever for the similarities between the songs.

       " '\"gave the dog five scents\"\\nwhat the hell are they going to do with a nickel?\\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\n*cries tears of stupidity* SAME Panzerfaust same Haha thats what I thought Same Yep. Me too. separated for four minutes -> friendly greeting\\nseparated for four hours -> excited greeting\\nseparated for four days -> pee everywhere Separated for a week:\\n\\nDestroy house My dogs seperated four minutes Frantic greeting, four hours franitic greeting four days holy Shyte greeting lol closed bathroom door insestant crying lol, meaning I am not allowed to go to the bathroom alone :p When i would deploy, my dog would stop eating after a couple weeks and mope around. I would have to call home and my family would hold the phone to his ear and i would talk to him. After that he knew I was around and he would go back to eating. I have had him for 15 years now, and I wouldnt trade them for all the money in the world. @Brawl Stars Fights! Legends never die smh. @Brawl Stars Fights! Dude... He must be dead by now. @crotchrocket00 I agree!  Because my dog is my constant companion,  he is the most important thing in my life.  Of course I have family whom I love (but they are thousands of miles away) and I have friends (but their work schedule is the opposite of mine), but my dog is always with me and the bond is very strong.  Additionally he has such a happy personality he makes me happy and when I am not well or feeling down, he is extra attentive.  I wouldn\\'t trade my dog for all the money in the world either. It\\'d be nice if you also mention the story of Hachiko, the dog that waited at the train station everyday for his owner to return to despite the owner himself already passed away. I watched 2 sad dogs movies in a row before a photoshoot that didn‚Äôt go too well ryoga316 yes They\\'re both together now, R.I.P both of them. ryoga316 thanks so much I totally agree!!! And he kept coming years after that I thought the sentence was \"they gave dogs 5 cents\" and for the split second it took you to explain that sentence my mind was completely confused and wondering why dogs would care about money. lmao Im so happy I belong to this little community of confusion. Me too lol üòÇ I shook people do like me WAHAHAHAHA LMAO NOT NOT NOT NOT ME TOO In our superior human language, we pronounce two completely unrelated things the same way :P my dog still misses me.\\n\\nBUT HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER! Lol gravity falls Nice Her aim is getting better! dogs are social creatures... And humans are also social beings... And as sharing those same traits of course there are going to be similarities... Dogs miss and grieve for each other... It is natural and part of nature... And yes if the dog loves you and has a special close true bond with you, they will miss you and will grieve for you if you do not show up for a long period of time... They need the companionship and love as much as we need them..  I want to just end this with... remember,... They are never JUST a dog... And I really wish people would stop looking at dogs as property or furniture.. I wish people would stop calling them pets, and start treating them as companions with feelings a hear a mind and a SOUL as well as a living being..  Hey dogs could look at us as hairless ape monsters that chatter and scream a lot... But they don\\'t.. The see us as friends.. We should really learn from that.. My Nugget has been my son since day one that he rested his little head on my shoulder to tell me ‚Äútake me home please‚Äù. My life has never been the same. He is my pride and joy! orangie84 you...use...elipses...too...much... My dog died last November after 13 years of living together with me. I still miss him... My dog Got Scared at a rainy Night on Springbreak he got scared at night so he ran away and to this day whatever day you are reading this I still miss him ALOOOOOT @Malak Rhazali Thank you! im so sorry for your miss Our dogs do see us as the one\\n                        \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n :O I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN You lost me at the 5 cents. What exactly did they buy with them? Pedro Nascimento well...Make it sound like a joke since the only joke right know is you Pedro Nascimento can\\'t blame him when you legit sound stupid instead of trying to make a joke. Lmao @zaproid You\\'re ruining my joke. I feed my kids with internet points. Stop killing my kids! Not cents. A scent or otherwise known as a distinctive smell. Example: The milk is rotten, the foul scent cave it away. So like we, humans, can use scents to examine our surroundings to, for example, see if something is edible, dogs can do the same, but to a higher degree thanks to their better noses. Dogs actually use mostly smell to identify people and other dogs or animals. So they cave the dogs 5 scents to sniff during the experiment. In short: the english language is funky, trust me, it fooled me at first as well. subscribedüòÉ   I found your channel from the shout-out on \"its okay to be smart.\" To you and all the other creators that make well researched, entertaining educational videos: Thank You!! I am a counselor and often bookmark videos to watch with my clients.  Thanks to YouTube creators like you, I have access to well researched, concise, entertaining videos that I can use to help start conversations with apathetic teens, explain complex ideas to kids, and  spark the curiosity of adults who\\'ve forgotten the world is fascinating and beautiful. hkandm4s23 @Arraik Cruor thank you! I sincerely appreciate that:-) I love your dog <3\\n\\nI thought this video would break my heart (because I thought the title automatically implied a \"no\" answer), but instead it gave me warm fuzzies <3 With regards to the statements starting at 2:35. No, research says there\\'s a link between body size, metabolism rate and visual processing speed. There is no magical thing about humans that makes them especially slow at visual processing.\\n\\nSecondly, there is no feeling of slow-mo for animals because that would mean the animal is seeing things at slower speed than they are happening. That\\'s impossible. Instead what happens at a higher visual processing speed is just that, more frames per second. You get to see things that normally would be a blur for animals with slower visual processing speeds.\\n\\nOh, and the flickering of the videos, no, it would just look choppy, like a low fps game. There would be no blackouts. Remember, higher and lower visual processing rates just indicate fps really, and there\\'s nothing special about humans that magically makes them shittier at visual processing like the video implies. It\\'s about body size and metabolism. What a crazy video. Who has a land line these days??? @anubis2814 LOL!!  I do!!  And what\\'s funny,  if I have ordered food and the delivery person phones that they are at the front of my building, I say \"okay, I\\'m coming down to get it\", my dog immediately turns around and stares at the door before I even prepare to get the food.  He knows that the phone ringing and me saying that phrase means that I\\'m leaving for a bit and coming back.  He doesn\\'t react to my cell phone whatsoever. I enjoyed the video. I don\\'t know if you are aware that the behind the scenes video is listed as private. Looks like a labradoodle. But I maybe wrong :D +BrainCraft what is ur dogs breed, she beautiful üòÄ +BrainCraft lol Thanks! I accidentally upload a 15 second video of Luna chewing instead of the real thing. It\\'s live now:\\xa0http://youtu.be/eEJXfzUs3nY Have they done this study on humans yet though? I mean, would a kid miss a parent that never fed them or treated them terribly, and not miss them, whereas they would miss a person that fed and sheltered them. Dont we almost always only miss people because theyve given us a positive expereience in the past, wheter its sex, food or being taken care of. Would those same parts of the brain light up as the dogs, like when say, i go to my moms house only because i know theyre having pizza? Isnt associating positive feelings with someone really the same as loving or missing them, or at least similar.  If dogs need higher framerate to perceive motion in videos, does that mean the act of them watching TV is just a misunderstanding? Having seen some of the videos on YouTube, where a dog is returned to its loving family after a long separation... I\\'m pretty damn sure those dogs were happy about the reunion... (err.... wimpering with ecstatic joy would be more like it. Do they miss us? You BET they miss us.)Search: *\"Dog reunites with original owners and cries.\"*\\n\\n(At this point I would normally\\xa0paste\\xa0the link, but YouTube is misbehaving again, and will not let me. I do not know why it does this, but sometimes it goes into a sulk.) @Bash Cat Yup! Got it.\\xa0Forward slash watch. @Bash Cat OK. I\\'ll try that in future. Thanks for the hint... (kind of you).\\xa0 Hello, this is dog. my dog when he was a pup was able to \"tell time.\" If you told him \"i need to be up at 8 o\\'clock\" at 7:59 he would scratch at the door of your bedroom (or give you kisses if your door was open), and it would work at any morning time. we never really experimented with it and he is no longer allowed upstairs so we dont know if he still does it, but I was never sure how he was so on the nose each time with no training. I don\\'t think you can say what time to wake up lol but my old dog used to know when I would get up there were times when I would forget to put on and alarm say around 8.00 I\\'m the morning he would scratch at the door or bark waiting outside the door at around the same timeonly a few minutes off so I think they have a certain degree of time but can\\'t put my finger on how he knew to a point Xanderqwerty123   I\\'m calling bullshit on this one. there is a theory that dogs \"tell time\" because of the amount smell we leave behind, diminishes over time. Their sense of smell is so acute and they can make correlations, so that they can learn to anticipate when their master returns, because it is when his/her lingering scent has dropped under a certain level, and they come back. (Sorry for the broken grammar, it,s late, I\\'m dead tired) That is frickin amazing üëåüèº can you teach my dog that Fry\\'s Seymour dog anyone? *direct on the feels* +Niller Symphony nowhere near crispy enough +Niller Symphony Hachiko Ok, but...why is she holding half a brain in the middle of a park? I have a dog I love and the people around me can prove my dog misses me. I\\'m only around my dog half the time and when I get back people say things like \"He\\'s just not the same when you\\'re away.\" And \"He\\'s really sad for most the time you\\'re not here.\" My dog is counting time for shure, he wants me to feed him on time, even if he already got a big treat not that long ago, so he can\\'t have hungry at that time. Also I\\'ve heard from a housemate that he just waits for me and starts standing at the door about 10min before I come home. Maybe not all dogs are like him but he is very intuitive and clever. Very interesting! And Luna is adorable :) Does the image processing rate also mean that dogs experience our house lights as flickering? HAHAHAHA The \"Hello, this is dog\" at the end made me explode in laughter xD 0:55\\n\\nOh, I thought the guy paid dogs 5 cents to do things!üòÇ It depends on the individual dog. Some dogs will actually miss \"you\" as where some dogs will just not like the fact they\\'re alone and/or missing out. 2:15 Of course time affects it, they just feel like they\\'ve been waiting forever after 2-4 hours, since they can\\'t read our clocks. 0:58 lol when she said they gave the dogs \"5 scents\" I thought she said 5 cents, like they paid the dogs a freaking nickel Lmao Over the years, I\\'ve learned that none of my three cats care how long I was gone. All they care about is upon my return they get food. My family\\'s dog is also named Luna :) Great video - and your dog looks so sweet! Ps: Luna is darn cute, and those eyes! <3 My dog definitely misses me when I\\'m gone! She will just sleep and pout when I\\'m at work all day, even if the rest of the family is home. And forget going out of town... if I\\'m gone for more than a couple of days she gets a rash!\\n\\nLuna! (pets with mouse) It\\'s been 3 months since I\\'ve seen my dog since I left for the military. I was told he got depressed and waited at my bedroom door for me :( When I came back from work my cat is so excited and comes to the door purring, no matter how long we have out. 2:44 thanks for the seizure warning... Think back to your earliest memories when you were 2 or 3. That‚Äôs the closest you‚Äôll get to living the day to day experience of a dog. I had a dog he knew  what time i got home  and when I went to work he ran into the neighbors yard  but five minuets before i got home he ran back into his yard. Loved this video. :3\\n\\nThank you, Braincraft.\\xa0\\n\\n*Thumbs up for effort, quality and content* 2:36 Those plugs. They\\'ve seen some serious stuff Damn, I was so scared that I will find out they don\\'t and my heart would break into million dog-shaped pieces. Definitely... having spent months away from home then coming back to our collie going absolutely ballistic for at least half an hour has convinced me of this. Whenever I cook ramen in the micro machine, I share with my dog. So every time 3 minutes is about to come around on the clock, he starts yelling and screaming at me to go get the ramen before the clock is over I remember hearing about one study that hypothesized that dogs tell time by smell. To test this, they had the owner walk out of the room to go to work. Usually, the dog would jump at the owner every time he came home after being gone for hours. What the scientist did was wave the owner\\'s sweaty clothes around every so often. This kept the owner\\'s smell from dissipating. When the owner came home, the dog reacted as though he had only been gone for a little while. The dog could\\'t tell that the owner had been gone for hours because his smell was still around. When my mom leaves for work one of my dogs always starts howling. Then after about 5 minutes, he gets my other dog howling. Also, if my dog (he is passive, and doesnt hunt) sees something out the window, he will bark to let my other dog (she is extremely aggressive and will literally go after anything that moves that is not a person) know that something is there and she will run over. its kinda cute. When my dog was alive he would barely eat until we came home from vacation. As soon as we came home he would eat. He died of old age though. before I watch I\\'m going to answer\\nYES. yes dogs miss us. my dog freaked out when I took a trip to Texas from Florida to help my patents and sun move back to Ga. a month later when my fianc√© and Ginger our 1¬Ω old pit bull picked me up at the Orlando airport she Ginger for real excited and peed all over our seat. when I first left Bobby, my fella said she would not eat and started peeing in the house. (she house trained) now me and Ginger are inseparable. she is with me almost everywhere I go\\n but she also loves her \\'daddy\\'. when he took a weekend trip to Ga to help his uncle move his wife\\'s side back to Florida Ginger didn\\'t act too sad during the day but at night she would wait by the van for Bobby to show up. (we were recently homeless sleeping in our van up until a few weeks ago.) so we both missed him but a couple days later when we went to pick him up, bobby came up to the driver side door and said, \"HEY BABY!!\" \\nGinger, In the drivers seat, started prancing her feet up and down, wagging her little butt and make this face I\\'ve never seen. like she was smiling. she then jumps on me to get to bobby and licks his face. when I opened the for to let her or she happy peed all over herself then she settled down. put her head down like she was embarrassed. or baby girl thought she was in trouble. I love our dog and she loves us unconditionally. I don\\'t think this video will deny a dogs ability to miss us but just In case it does ( like another video I once watched) I thought I\\'d throw my .02¬¢ in. \\nnow let\\'s see what you guys have to say on the subject. The question is:\\nThe dogs miss us or the dogs miss the person who feed them?\\n\\nAnd the cats? And other animals?\\nA video about animal\\'s thought would be nice. I went away on holiday for 5 days and when I came home my dog (she was fed by friend) went absolutely nuts because she was so happy to see me again, she wouldn\\'t leave me for about 5-10 minutes My friend\\'s dog practically loves her because she always cries when my friend is gone I really love your voice! So fitting for the type of videos you make, so keep up the good work. I really love your voice! So fitting for the type of videos you make, so keep up the good work. 3:05 I AM THE ONE DONT WEIGH A TON It\\'s awesome that you talked about that, I\\'ve had the opportunity to be at a friend\\'s house with his dog and learn about its behavior.\\nHe (the dog) would never leave me, to the point where I couldn\\'t leave his sight, until my friend came back, suddenly I wasn\\'t there (dog didn\\'t care at all).\\nAnd the intensity of his excitement did stop rising after a few hours, but I think the reason for that is that he couldn\\'t run any faster towards his owner :) I left my dog for 1 minute came back he got so happy for some reason, and that\\'s why my dog looks like he doesn\\'t really like youtube videos 1:49 there\\'s a laser I love dogs so much. It\\'s just a being of pure love. How come one of my dogs responds and can see images on the tv however my other dog dose not? I dont like socializing, No FOMO The dogs I live with are the best alarm clocks I never bought. Breakfast, lunch and dinner, they tell me everytime we\\'re late feeding them. Dogs have a perception of time. I feed my dogs their second meal everyday around 10:30 pm. A couple of years ago when I just had my lab my Grandmother used to come stay on Thursdays. She would feed my dog Jett at eight thirty P.M. every Thursday night or have me feed him at that time. So every right around eight thirty, my white lab, Jett would come up to my Grandmother to let her know it was meal time. Jett made an association between my Grandmother being at my house on Thursdays, and his dinner being served early. I love your dog he\\'s so cute I feel really sad watching this video. I recently moved away to go to college and if everything I left behind (including my parents) I miss my dog the most. She is my everything. I don\\'t know how I\\'ll go on without her. :( and one week the dog tries to hug me and try to knock me down 2:20 Those sockets don\\'t look very safe... She sounds like the person on the news talking I love the dog in this video.....oh be still my heart! What a cutie pie! Interesting topic :) I\\'d love to see a video about this but about cats (as I really want to believe my kitty misses me as much as I miss her !) But how would they see a video with 48 or 60 FPS? PC MASTER RACE. +Rodrigo Appendino yeah, that was really blury - so the way dogs perceive images, are more like modern cameras? ...or ? i need answers too ;) +Rodrigo Appendino Or even 100 FPS Whenever my dad or mom goes to the bathroom, my dog just lies or sits outside the door, waiting for them. Cute lmao I work and come home every other day. I got stuck staying out an extra night and my dog greeted me with even more  ferver  than the usual very happy to see me. I believe they are aware of time in their sense. her voice is so perfect that any mic sounds pro that a lab-doodle?(if thats even a thing) 2:45 Thanks for the nightmare. When ur gone for 1 second u come back cuz u left ur phone the says omg what took u soooooooo long i also found out my dog can remember the times i do certain things when i get back at my normal time hes sleeping by the door, but when i came 1 hour earlier he was still sleeping on my bed as usual when i normally go to sleep the couch to my bed when im gonna make dinner on normal time he walks to the kitchen an lays there etc, i feel like they are really good at knowing when something is but arent that good in knowing length of time like how much time passes My dog miss me when i go anywhere 4:20 minutes 8^) My dog has separation anxiety. I can\\'t leave the house for more the 5 minutes with out him crying. I had a dog for 6 years, now he stays with a friend while I travel, Once it was almost 2 years between a visit, the longer I am gone, the more frantic he acts when I come back Hello ?This is dog !That was awesome :-) ive been switching between this video and the one you told me to check out for 8 hours can i stop now üò¶ This video needed a warning for the flashing lights. Ow my poor brain. My dog does he alway waits by the window and when we come back he jumps on us I haven\\'t even looked at this and can answer \\n\\nYes.. they so needy \\n\\nCats just get on with it Really well made. I know that if I leave for two hours vs a couple days my dogs are always more excited to see me That was freaky f images OMG You\\'re so adorable. 2:45 is where the party starts i use to house sit for my \"sister\\'s boyfriends\\' mom\" cause she need someone to take care of her German Shepherd if she went out of town.\\nafter doing it a couple times the next time i came over to house sit the dog saw me and started to want tons of attention from her and whined cause i guess she figured out that when i came over she would leave for a while. I really miss my dog :( ...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHah JK i never had dog My Thai aunt\\'s two dogs do jump on my family it does mean they miss usüòÇ I have a dog and my mom had to give her away and I haven\\'t seen her in 3 years and I want to go see her but I don\\'t know if she will remember me Whenever I go to school at 2:00 P.M. my dog would sit at the front door waiting for me to come home. *They give them 5 scents!*\\n\\nWhy would you give them a dime\\n\\n*Sabrina, you really are stupid* I love your videos, guys!

And he\\'s 10000% soo humble and down to earth *\"this is a \"women\\'s wear\" jacket. but i\\'m a man, and i\\'m wearing it. so it\\'s a men\\'s jacket.\"*\\n\\nPREACH\\nthough clothes don\\'t have genders. i argue with my mom sometimes because i find like a flannel or a jacket cool and she will say \"that\\'s for boys\" i ain\\'t mad but like-- if you think something looks good on you, buy it! clothes having genders is just pointless. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº @Way to Mars No, you stop. All of them here have conveyed their points through sound reasoning. You don\\'t get to shut people\\'s opinions down because you disagree or don\\'t understand them. @Raziya Aziz Omfg shut up. Stop making everything so complicated. What he meant was that style doesn\\'t have gender. Just stop. I agree that no one should tell you what to wear. I also agree with Caitlyn, the other person who replied to this. I think clothes have genders because they are made different to fit the bodies. But clothes shouldn‚Äôt have genders based on who wants to wear them. sorry but i disagree a little. women tend to need wider thigh area in pants and tend to need for in the butt area. Also womens shirts are a bit slimmer and wider at the top (to leave room for boobs). Usually, the difference in womens and mens clothes are there because of style (women like high waist more than men, men like less fringes/etc) and because of the cut of the clothing. I am a girl and personally cant fit any mens pants properly. But i think for things like jackets and stuff, gender neutral makes more sense. I am genuinely sad that he isn\\'t and never will be my boyfriend. @Ashley DaRonche Girl.... stop it. Don\\'t feed their delusion. No one\\'s delusion for that matter. @Zack D Yeah. The guy beside him in the car is his boyfriend. @Zack D he has a boyfriend. But I think everyone says he is bi. @yumisue na how do i not know this i fully support this with my whole heart LMAO i mean he\\'s actually pansexual.. so we do have a chance ladies. But i doubt that, cause he\\'s in a really loving and happy relationship with Eric Smith. They both look like a snacc, so I don\\'t blame them for dating each other HAHAHA he is literally one of the most beautiful men that I have ever seen. You got that right!!! Such mesmerizing blue eyes....Idc if I am old enough to be his mama, he evokes these unmaternal feelings in me.....üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç I found him in American horror story. He went from playing the Antichrist to an aerobics teacher... He\\'s amazing!! And I know he has many other roles too but my goodness... He\\'s super talented... And super charming... I will always love him... allie biersack he was ASTOUNDING in The Assassination of Gianni Versace watch him on american crime story versace, his best performance a d was robbed from an emmy nom at least Same way i found him. It was in AHS:1984 that I was like omg he is gorgeous! I love him!!! Yes to this comment There\\'s something otherworldly about Cody - something elusive but powerful at the same time. He seems like the gentlest person on Earth but laced with immense internal force that draws you in. Cody emanates with this hipnotizing kind of elvish/divine/alien aura that\\'s just irresistible. Yesss so true you just put my every thought about him into words also I think that‚Äôs what makes him so good at acting that personality trait makes him able to play any character and his art is amazing because of it Because he is south node is virgo north node is pisces. Mix in earth and otherwordly. this is exactly how i feel about him Yes to the point where you cant take your eyes off him! just checking the comments to make sure that i\\'m not the only one that wants him to DESTroy me imagine being this insanely gorgeous @Ms. Valdez let us simp in peace pls Ms. Valdez ok you got me üò≠üò≠ @Darth Maul dont what me you already deleted your commentüòÇüòÇ it was very simpish Ms. Valdez what? Fr Clothing should not have a gender. We all need clothes, who cares what type we choose to cover ourselves? i disagree. womens shirts and mens shirts are different for a reason, women need area in the top for boobs, slimmer in the torso because of smaller waist. Most guys have a wider waist in proportion to chest than women. Same thing with jeans. Women have wider thighs, waist, and bigger butt, so we tend to have different cut of jeans than guys. If you can fit their clothes, great good for you, but for most people, that isnt the case. I like that they put a womens or mens label because i know i am more likely to fit womens clothes. and i know that it is more likely to be my style @Archons really? With that type of mentality we would go back to being animals, what‚Äôs next money should have no value ? We make those society norms for a reason. @truth be getting told you remind of a preacher. the bad kind @truth be getting told  Literally what are you trying to achieve here?? Let people wear what they want and chill out, it\\'s just clothes. Cody Fern is the king of style. Plus, he‚Äôs so gorgeous & talented & charming. Seriously cannot get enough of him.

Debt is useful but it\\'s dangerous. Ummm..... that\\'s not the moral of the story at all.... @Jake Kline\\'s Fancy Noises There are many reasons a home may be costly.  Perhaps the most common one is that in places where people want to live, for example due to good jobs, good weather, good schools, etc., demand exceeds supply.  \\n\\nI never argued for mcmansions.  I was trying to explain that most ordinary working people need a loan to buy a house.  Nothing more.\\n\\nUsury has specific legal meaning, though the biblical meaning may be different.  Legally, home loans at 3% interest are not usury.\\n\\nP.S. \"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\" @Loanword Eggcorn the only reason it\\'s exceedingly hard for a home buyer to acquire a property is because people have taken that ticket millions of times in the U.S.  Did you know studies show that, once a very minimal square footage per person is reached, excess space in a home actually begins to contribute negatively to happiness, rather than positively?  And the required square footage is shockingly small, contrasted with modern American expectations.  The optimal number was something like 750 sqft to start, plus either 50 or a 150 square foot per person.  But this is where consumeristic materialism and usery get a people.\\n\\nWe never needed mcMansions to be happy, and we never needed usery for anything, let alone healthy and sustainable growth, which is impossible when we have to feed the beast.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the everything bubble may very well be about to burst as we speak. @Jake Kline\\'s Fancy Noises Agree with everything you wrote, to some extent.  \\n\\nYet, over the long term, real estate and other real assets are a great investment, especially due to inflation.  Real assets hold value and/or appreciate over the long term.\\n\\nReal estate organically goes up in value where there is demand, since its supply is limited.\\n\\nBanks do not own properties that are fully paid for.  \\n\\nBanks facilitate growth.  Without a lender, its exceedingly hard for a home buyer to acquire a property.  It\\'s also hard for someone to build a new home to create new supply without a lender.  Not impossible, but very hard.\\n\\nIt\\'s really easy to paint banks as the bad guy, but it\\'s also not completely fair if one considers their actual role and function.\\n\\nDon\\'t take the easy way out.  Think.\\n\\nAnd yes, I\\'m aware of banks buying government bonds with Fed credit.  It\\'s how both are capitalized.  Credit needs to come from somewhere.   Chicken and egg. @Loanword Eggcorn it\\'s the timing, that undoes those who take your advice.  The boom-bust cycle is a natural result of a system that issues money at interest, with no interest-free money to pay back the exponentially growing debt.  The practical end of the stick is that there are always, always losers, and the banks always, always get the real assets out of them, in exchange for owning and operating the funny-money system. When you get more knowledge a thousand times faster than in every school or university.

Who\\'s here because you want to learn essential lessons that aren\\'t taught in school? If you really care about  essential lessons then you need to watch The Choice Is Ours instead. This one does not portray the true picture on what really goes on under the hood. @Supernatural Forces Your argument seems to assume a stagnant, no-growth economy. \\n\\nPrice inflation happens when money is printed in excess of actual growth.  If an economy grows, and most do, then more money is needed to represent the value in it.  Money printing alone doesn\\'t cause inflation.  Money printing in excess of actual growth does. I can\\'t think of many essentials that schools teach kids @Josip Dasovic Also this pertains only to the US, if I\\'m not mistaken. @Matt Athauda ‚Üë See? :D Learned more in 30min video than in 3 years economy class Elena, where do you study? Seriously. Really; what exactly did you learn? Hi Elena...... me too @RealFarRight you watch Fox News? blahahahahahahaaha! then you slept thru 3 years of economics. Anyone come here from a tik tok they saw To know how works capitalism you need to know the current monetary weaknesses and problems. It is impossible to return to Gold Standard See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiKr-i022mY A\\nTiK TOKER \\nHES ELIMIHBVDASTTWFHEEDFHDDDF I told people about this on TikTok :) ahlawat18 what‚Äôs the name of the tik tok? Was looking if there was a comment abt this before I commented it lol watched 7 years later, and most of the problems have appeared today: 0 interest rate, more printing, revolution, next will be war? Wish a beautiful deleveraging This video should be shown in schools before they start to teach the textbook economics !!\\nMost people don\\'t know how the economy actually works, I was one of them before watching this video,but slowly my understanding of economics is increasing !!!\\nThanks RAY DALIO !!! üíêüíêüíêüëçüëçüëåüëå love this class. I will make everyone in my family see this including my dog. I like ur sense of humor. Now he (my dog) has a different walk, more confidence. Your comment made me burst into laughter lol hahaha Who\\'s watching in 2020, the deleveraging is happening now. @CYANIDE PLAYS YES JUST WATCH THE MONTHLY GRAPH OF NASDAQ :) THE AVG LEVEL AND TIME FOR CORRECTION LIKE THIS CRASH TAKES AROUND 2 YEARS TO FORM, BUT NOW THAT LEVEL IS REACHED IN JUST 6 MONTHS AFTER THE CRASH! PLOT 20 day ema + 50 day ema and see carefully :D @Permadoc it never is @Ana Bonet I feel that the state can print more money and less debt .. Army buildings or spy buildings but it prints money inside .. the money can be used to buy weapons, conduct research, prevent country debt, invest in other countries, make loans to the country other .. because the military building is a secret which should not be known by others ... can you investigate for that .. @Salim  I think is a need to forbid the Fractional Reserve Banking System (FRB), i.e., I agree with Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, Huerta de Soto, etc. But once forbidden the secondary monetary expansion (FRB), how do to coordinate the industrial monetary needs?  Well, they are several options, like the Chicago Plan Revised, but after reading Pedro Gomez\\'s book, the best solution is the monetary expansion through-out the Progressive Growth of the Money Supply Principle. This system sets a cap in order for Central Banks and politicians can\\'t issuance money over the quantity indicated by the own market. I suggest reading The Wealth of Nations in the 21st Century, by Pedro Gomez, which analyze all the options to issuance money, their strengths and weaknesses. A very interesting historical review and, furthermore a new and realistic proposal to issue money, that allows controlling the man in charge of the printer machine. www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiKr-i022mY Case or example\\n\\n\\nState R prints money in the name of mabo ... and mabo transactions are used all over the world and the R state is very difficult for debt and inflation because more countries need money for transactions such as world oil or the like ... and countries A, B, C and\\xa0 T converts money or buys Mabo money into country R for transactions ... and country R can burn state A and T money ... and countries A and T print more money for transactions within their country ... and countries A and T cost 2x\\xa0 print money .. can the country R be transparent to other countries\\' currencies that have been in exchange rates or change to mabo currencies .. how many countries have changed these currencies .. the money is made transactions in to that country .. if not transactions to that country\\xa0 is there still money from their country\\'s money? Who\\'s here in June - 2020.. we are 23:43 Social Unrest... ooh I wonder what happens next? @CHECK CHECK it\\'s because republicans aren\\'t socialists @caleb Tse Shut up, I know more economics than anybody. Trump understands it. He asked the Fed to lower interest rate. He quickly approved stimulus money and he is creating new jobs. @caleb Tse trump has been a businessman mogul his entire life, what the fuck are you saying,lmao? @caleb Tse Trump has been a businessman since the 70s im pretty sure he understands all this, the problem is that he either cant or wont do something to fix it considering how little politicians care about the common citizen \"Because we borrow, we have slaves... err...I mean cycles!\" Moron How? Do you know what slavery is? I think one needs to be a genius in order to be able to explain such an incredibly complex thing in such a beautifully simple way. Yeah, generally it\\'s a good measure of someones grasp of an idea. For most people if they can explain something quite well, in a manner most people will easily understand, then they probably have an excellent grasp of said thing (or are very good story tellers). If someone can\\'t explain something to you very well (unless it\\'s say, quantum physics level abstract) then they either don\\'t really know what they are talking about or have a communication issue.\\n   Concerning this video, at first I thought: \\'Oh no... he\\'s going to grossly oversimplify and miss stuff\\'. By the end of it I was thinking: \"I hope I can explain economic ideas half this well one day...\". Keep it simple guys: Spend less then you earn.\\nWanna spend more, earn more.\\nCan\\'t earn more because of time? Change the current way you get money, in other word; Multiple income streams.\\nAnd to top it all off, the more passive your income is, the more time you spend spend to be productive somewhere else... or just enjoy life ;) eyyy quarantine got me getting smart out here First case / example\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa01. Country A and B .. country A has a population of 2 billion people country B has a population of 300 million .. the currency of country A to country B has 3 thousand money .. and country A provides debts to many countries to countries C, D and E\\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0The question of why country A has currency to country b 3 thousand ... and why country A is higher in currency than country B. if country A has more population than country B .. and country A owes debt to C, D and E means\\xa0 they have more money for the population and build the country .. the more the population should be the greater the expenses such as education, health, welfare, development, paying officials etc ... print as much currency and then offer country A currency loans to many countries.\\xa0 .\\xa0 and order people to invest in other countries .. and that money can be exchanged for natural resources, create media, investment in other countries, businesses in other countries, make slaves (employees) .. how can a population of 2 billion to a country with a population of 300 million\\xa0 resident currency of country A is higher than country B Case or example\\n\\n\\nState R prints money in the name of mabo ... and mabo transactions are used all over the world and the R state is very difficult for debt and inflation because more countries need money for transactions such as world oil or the like ... and countries A, B, C and\\xa0 T converts money or buys Mabo money into country R for transactions ... and country R can burn state A and T money ... and countries A and T print more money for transactions within their country ... and countries A and T cost 2x\\xa0 print money .. can the country R be transparent to other countries\\' currencies that have been in exchange rates or change to mabo currencies .. how many countries have changed these currencies .. the money is made transactions in to that country .. if not transactions to that country\\xa0 is there still money from their country\\'s money? Ray Dalio explains it all!\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaPrKFt-w5UYVwsnIZ162pLcbIwKZxgbo I feel u. eyye! üòÅ now we need to reject those vaccines and chips that they\\'re trying to put in every body in the world.. #Markofthebeast @„ÄéLuna - Chan„Äè It ezz what it ezz The only thing they need to show early in school to everybody  on the planet a financial education most  essential concept @Kent Wilbert dont forget about science @Kent Wilbert then you have to work hard like bill gates, warren buffet and jeff bezos @MASTER FAZE Try hard gamer I am also 7 years late..... I watched this video cuz I\\'m interested in game economics perfectly balanced as all thing should be so am i The economy works by keeping you needed. You\\'ll never have enough and always need more. As he said in the video: \"The economic system is much more complicated that this\". 23:08: *Jeff Bezos left the chatroom* Ray is billionaire himself This video just proves what king Solomon said:\\n\\n*The servant is borrower to the lender.*\\n\\nAs smooth talking as Ray sounds he is indirectly admitting that the Central Banks control the short and long term debt cycles. While we are meant to see it as a result of \"human nature\" this is in fact a problem which has been artificially created.\\n\\nSadly we have another classical case of the _Wizard of Oz_ occurring with the man behind the curtain. The man behind the curtain being the central government and the central banks operating the levers of this \"Economic Machine\". Yet how do people fall for this facade? *When the people lose their brains* (Scarecrow = No Education), *lose their hearts* (Tinman = Unfeeling Machine), and *become cowardly* (Lion = Loss of bravery): then the people are easily terrorized by the ravenous flying monkeys and duped by the spells of the wicked witch. @Michael_S_K piercing explanation.  I thought I was going to have to explain the social engineering but you put it in terms that renew my understanding of the importance. I would have to answer this with a resounding *no.* To say that the central banks \"control\" the debt cycles is not correct. By cutting or raising interest rates, they merely incentivize certain modes of behavior, i.e. lending and spending, or saving and hoarding. The fact that they can *influence* the debt cycle through this is because of human nature. If you are offered a credit with little interest, you are more likely to take it. However, the central banks cannot control what you *do* with that money. If you use it to create a business that creates value for society, there is a benefit for everyone and you can of course pay back the money. If you use it to buy a TV that results in you spending your evenings with sitting around and watching stuff, instead of doing productive/creative work, then that is *your* responsibility.\\n\\nAs such, it is in human nature to take \"that which comes easy\", then quickly get used to it, take it for granted and basically waste it. It is in fact the *advertising business* that helps bring forth the worst in human nature: by telling us that we are entitled to the most modern devices, and the newest and most expensive items, they create a dissonance in us. So we are supposed to have earned all these things just by being born, but we don\\'t have the money for it? The solution is easy: lend and consume. The long-term outcome: an economic bubble and hard times.\\n\\nThe business of advertising is the true culprit: from attacking our physical health (downplaying the dangers of fast food, sweets & cigarettes) to our financial health (buying things we don\\'t really need or actually want) to our social health (creating ever more addictive social media software), they have not spared any aspect of our lives. There are only two ways to solve this: regulate the ad business, or strengthen our wills and values. what a great comment, thanks for sharing. @Lonnie T human nature is merely what is taken advantage of by what I described one comment above this one. @Infinite Rings  The boom-bust cycle is a natural result of a system that issues money at interest, with no interest-free money to pay back the exponentially growing debt. The practical end of the stick is that there are always, always losers-- it\\'s mere timing, which undoes some of those who borrow-- and the central banks always, always get the real assets out of them, in exchange for owning and operating a funny-money system. This is 30 minutes of my time well spent Took me a little over an hour to get through the 30 mins because I was pausing to reflect on what was said. Ray Dalio explains it all!\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaPrKFt-w5UYVwsnIZ162pLcbIwKZxgbo @snide 2 I would love to disagree with you lol. Peace from New Zealand. @jdfarr45 For starters, Ray Dalio isn\\'t a Jew.  You\\'re nuts if you think that \"Jews\" have some conspiracy. Im Jewish. I work my a** off and I\\'m in debt because of dumb choices I made. Majority of my people people work hard. Some make it economically, some don\\'t. Many have financial literacy which helps economically. Many are overachievers. In my community there\\'s generally a culture of personal and communal responsibility and commitment to family.\\nWithout getting granular, many Jews probably champion the exact economic theories that you\\'re convinced of. Don\\'t jump to call millions of anyone \"evil\" etc. Peace unto you. –í–ª–∞–¥–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤ –ü–∏–ª–∏–ø–µ–Ω–∫–æ yea it is weird I‚Äôm not believing him. It‚Äôs just racist bullshit. Holy crap this is from 2013, even the protests right now check out. I never understood economics until now. What a perfect explanation! Big fan! Addendum: The FED is in private hands. Very likely in the hands of the super rich bankers who founded it. \\n\\nThey can threaten the government (printing money or manipulating interest rates in a way to cause damage to the economy). And through the ability to create money from thin air, they can buy the favors of politicians, lawmakers etc.. Robert Couch Walking behind a Reel Mower is much, much healthier than walking behind a Gas mower. It‚Äôll cut the grass cleaner and cheaper and take up less room in the garage. \\n\\nPeople want to ‚Äú save time ‚Äú and use gas self propelled or riding mowers, only to spend even more time and money at a Gym or walking around the neighborhood for exercise.   \\n\\nThis is just the tip of the the Iceberg of 1,000‚Äôs of things that don‚Äôt make sense and/or efficient. \\nAstonishing for being in the 21st Century. One would think by now with all the combined time, experience, education and resources from a growing population we would do things better, smarter and more efficient. \\n\\nIt‚Äôs not that we aren‚Äôt smart enough, it‚Äôs that society puts profit first and putting energy into Looks & Design rather than Quality, Efficiency, Reliability and Durability.  \\n\\nSmart for Business and Profit, bad for Customers and Customers finances. Corporate America will sell you bull if you‚Äôre willing to buy bull. Ultimately it‚Äôs customers fault. No business can survive without customers. Smart marketing is not a reoccurring/ongoing cost, unlike a higher quality of material for a product. @YouTubesShitSorter I agree with your analogy with the lawn mower I\\'m sure of it that man\\'s downfall will be due to his efficiency so I went out to try to buy a new lawn mower one of those Scott push mowers are talking about it was a piece of s*** what gave me the idea to buy one was that I was at a antique store pushing one in the front of the store it cut the grass unbelievably easily quiet low cost no oil no gas and you can hang it up in the garage I agree with you man\\'s efficiency will be his downfall that lawn mower example I tried buying one of those Scott push mowers it was a piece of s*** although I I tried one at an antique store could not believe how the old ones cut the grass so easy and held up to everything that you said I\\'d say watch The Choice Is Ours for a potential way our of this mess we put ourselves into The United States population in- itself will grow regardless of the economy status and unemployment rates. The solution doesn\\'t get easier as time goes on and the problem only gets bigger, as the population of people \\'wanting to work\\' will increase with no jobs available. The oilfield and oilfield sustained companies can only support a certain size population here in the states regardless of how great and big it is.  As a massive backbone money generator to the economy it brings in money and keeps money exchanging hands, \\'physical cash \\' as it is passed from banks to restaurants, food, housing and activities and so on. \\n\\nWe are all at the mercy of the \\'population growth itself \\' some think we\\'re at the mercy of the mega rich, as it would seem they have all the money that would fix everything. But given Bill Gates billions, evenly distributed across America alone ( 300+ million people ) wouldn\\'t change anything. \\n\\nAny president can tax the rich but, it does \\'nothing\\' as a money generator to \\'grow\\' our economy. It‚Äôll just sustain it with Food Stamps, Housing, and Medical Care until the rich are no longer rich, and the middle-class becomes closer to being poor because of taxation, which in turn will add more people to being on gov\\'t benefits, increasing taxes once again for the rich. \\n\\nThe problem this country is facing is bigger than a superhero president can fix, after all if it doesn\\'t get pass congress it doesn\\'t happen... India has more citizens with IQ\\'s over 120 than the \\'total\\' population of the United States, 300+ million, enough to replace the whole United States with what modern society considers \\'geniuses\\' but, yet those 300 million geniuses combined cannot fix their own economy with a massive 890 million people in poverty making less than $2 a day. \\n\\nAmericans hope, wish and pray some president and local politicians are going to fix it all, but when you logically look at all the facts, economy and the majority of people and their situation surrounding us all, I realistically don\\'t see how. \\n\\nThe growing Population, Poverty Rate, Unemployment Rate, Crime, Real Estate prices, Taxes and prices of everything (Healthcare & Groceries ) Post Office prices, Automobile Prices are steadily increasing... \\n\\nADD all this up along with advancements in Technology, self driving cars, faster, more efficient & reliable machines that need less human interaction. At the same time it increases productivity, which brings down demand, which in turn brings down the price of the product. \\n\\nSo for example what you end up with is a bunch of farmers, and new farmers with modern, faster, expensive equipment. Equipment that they‚Äôre all trying to pay for and make a living, while essentially working against each other and themselves by racing to produce the most product, the fastest possible while the market is in demand. \\n\\nSeveral civilizations were wiped out by their own doing, meaning they harvested animals & resources smarter, faster and more efficiently, than the resources themselves could replenish. It was arguably the first sustainability crisis. The modern resource today being money. \\n\\nThe more work, a farmer,  for instance does, the more work he creates, the more equipment he needs and the more frequent repairs become. Often times fulfilling false demand. Planting more to fulfill last years shortage but, it‚Äôs too much for this years demand. Meaning it, the product went to waste or sold for pennies on the dollar of what it cost to harvest. Or just to break even, not counting time, let alone a profit. Time that could have been doing something profitable. \\n\\nAs a country we went from Manual Push Reel mowers that were quiet, didn\\'t pollute the air, didn\\'t require gas & oil, you could mow grass at anytime of the day or night without disturbing your neighbor, to \\' More \\' Expensive, Loud, Non-Catalytic converter polluting mowers that rips the grass rather than actually ‚Äò cutting the grass ‚Äò. My point is don\\'t assume as a society we\\'re making better decisions elsewhere. one person\\'s spending is another person\\'s income :^D Who\\'s watching in 2020? This is the best economics lesson I\\'ve ever gotten. for real man, 100% agree @fynes leigh Your worship of universities is concerning to me. \\n\\nResearch the currency debasement of Ancient Greece; they didn\\'t need to know about Keynes to use Keynesian economics.\\n\\nBut hey, maybe I\\'m just a retard and the economy will do just fine! Trust the bankers and stay invested in stocks and fiat lol. The world is about to learn a hard lesson it\\'s learned many times before, and I\\'ve no sympathy for those that defend this foolishness. @AndrewJackson If you please; at which University studying what did you encounter all these Keynesians and how many precisely did you canvas for their views?\\r\\n\\r\\nT-h-o-u-s-a-n-d-s of years you say; how many thousands of years would you say that Keynesians have been around? I wonder if you know when Maynard Keynes was born and when he died and that the chances that his ideas have been put into practice for   thousand years is stretching the imagination to put it well beyond snapping point, but apparently that hasn\\'t occurred to you, or perhaps it has; you tell me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m bound to say that I have discovered no particular merit in the ideas of Maynard Keynes  who was undoubtedly a learned  man of sorts, but the idea that his ideas have influenced people for thousands of years is just the tiniest bit dubious would you not say?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever subject you studied the University plainly did not call for any intellectual rigour whatsoever, but I think we both know that you have never been anywhere near a university in your life to we not? Certainly not a university that would tolerate sloppy language and sloppy thinking like that. @fynes leigh The people that study economics at universities are keynesians that have inflated fiat currencies to collapse for thousands of years. How do you know? When did you last study economics at University, or  at  any level?\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone knows to cure a kicking horse but him that has   him, and everyone supposes that he is an expert on economics, which in reality is a species of politics and or   religion.The first thing that you learn when you study economic is what money is, and since very few people understand economics everyone is an expert on it and nobody actually knows anything about it or understands that it is merely a species of politics or religion and that there is no such thing as the science of economics because economics is not a science, For the simple reason that it is impossible to directly immediately personally apprehend(as directly  and immediately  as  pain) such a complicated and vast thing as all the transactions that go on in various markets, So effectively the only method is to guess or estimate. Of course you ask other people but they generally lie or a mistaken,  that being the nature of men (human beings). The gold standard makes things look so much more stable. #endthefed This should be taught in every school This is indeed the best education in economics I have ever come across.

Gracias. One of the best teachings I\\'ve ever seen. Beautiful! oooh maaan, everything makes sense to me now. i am starting to like economics :D I swear I‚Äôve learnt more during this quarantine than all the years I was in school üôåüèΩ I‚Äôm a new woman lol Same lmao Good for you! Tell all your friends to watch it too and tell your friends\\' friends to watch it too. And a beautiful woman! üåπ G‚ò∫Ô∏èüòîüòî Even me lol Wow whoever created this video. He she is just awesome! No words. Work of the millennia! 14.30 onwards gave me chills. this whole generation is raised under the illusion that all is going good. but depressing times are coming. Delevaraging is happening because of the pandemic.\\nIn the cycle he animated its like removing a cogwheel and no longer works.\\nInflation and interest couldnt be pulled down causing economic collapse\\nI learned a lot today\\nThanks watching this now im realizing that from now on we have two choices: we will be heading to war or kamala and biden will deliver on the 2K stimulus This man is a Genius! a Gem for our generation and i hope to learn much more from this Legend. Totally agree Love the economic system america lives on for ever I used it to the advantage The fact that this video was made 6 years ago blows my mind Probably the best video on economics I\\'ve seen in my life! 1. Don\\'t have debt rise faster than income - your debt burdens will eventually crush you. \\n\\n2. Don\\'t have income rise faster than productivity - you will eventually become uncompetitive. \\n\\n3. Do all that you can to raise productivity because that\\'s what matters most. Now repeat step 1, 2 and 3 ü§™ü§™ü§™ Michael Francis great example! Like Amtrak has become too expensive between DC and NYC. Many people opt to drive or take the bus. Yes the Elite want us to work ourselves to death. No thanks. I have 0 interest in producing/spending more. My focus is personal growth & fitness. It doesn\\'t pay any money but that\\'s okay. Life is too short. Imagine if everyone said \"enough\" society would crumble. The Rich would lose power over us. The Rich want us on the Rat Race wheel in debt & working 80hrs per week. The government too so they collect more tax from us. Keep on running...... This generation has already failed on 1 and 2. College debt burden is higher then income for too many. And the income demands don\\'t line up with productivity, especially when shoehorned in through some diversity hiring principle. Crushed morale is also hampering point 3.\\nOutcome does not look good, does it? Yes!!!!! If this video or principle was taught in schools today, banks would be out of business!! brilliant! really opened my eyes. Inflation is created by government by devaluing money through money printing That‚Äôs was an amazing production. I learned and laughed at the same time.üëç This video sums up what took me about 4 years of gradual self learning to know in only 30 minutes! @Hawkins I already did all research that you didn\\'t do. And I can confirm that nobody is printing dollars out of nothing. Go research yourself. @Absolute Zerooh your ego is triggered now I see. Do yourself a favor, go do some research on what required reserve ratio is and on money creation. There is no point talking to you since you have no clues what you are talking about. Gross. @Hawkins Fiscal policy has nothing to do with credit, you are just speaking nonsense. @Hawkins the 20% is not the capital, it is the minimum deposit in cash the Bank has to have in order to be able to provide withdrawals in cash. If you are using credit card, this 20% deposit stays the same.\\nInterest on debt is not free money, it is earnings! I get the logic, it is you who is not getting it. @Absolute Zero also, you are referring to Fiscal policy. The Fed is responsible for Monetary policy. 19:30 ‚Äúwealth is redistributed from the have‚Äôs to the have not‚Äù. Total and utter rubbish the ruling class never do that! It‚Äôs true you just have to know how to capitalize off a crisis. Ray, thank you. Intuition informs these ideas, but never crystallizes them! I feel that if I watch this a few more times, I will internalize your teaching. It is very wonderful! It is well done, and simply presented. Fantastic effort-thank you. 0:40 seems complex, eh? Those gears in that configuration would never work, so... 28:29 my favorite scene Whose watching this in April 2020ü•≥üëÄ yup Ray Dalio explains it all!\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaPrKFt-w5UYVwsnIZ162pLcbIwKZxgbo Me ! A bengali @Jim Panse In my opinion (gained from much personal wrestling with the facts that are out there) most investors in Gold and Silver are buying and holding physical metal for a store of value. Crypto is still going through a lot of pump and dump...but people are catching on and figuring out that the limited quantity of cryptos is going to make them digital stores of value that can\\'t be printed...I don\\'t know if I am right in my strategy to shift my currency into the above investments, but I can tell you that I have watched dollars be printed to infinity while the amount of gold, silver, and most Cryptos all have finite and defined limited quantities. \\n\\n\\nSo to answer your question, I would say that in my opinion the answer is no; I don\\'t think that all assets would deleverage because I don\\'t think that most holders of the above items would be willing to trade those items for failing currencies unless we really had a complete collapse of society...in which case pork-and-beans is the only investment worth anything.\\n\\n\\nMan; I\\'ve been wrong many times before, though; if you feel that my logic is flawed then PLEASE educate me. Thanks; Cheers. The real question is \\'\\'Who watched this in 2013 and did something to take advantage\\'\\'\\nI did :) Damn he was so intelligent until about minute 24üò≠ Universities are now wells of poison, due to hegemony of \\'grievance studies\\' don\\'t send your kids there., learn online. I just discover that I live in a feudal country, thanks for this lesson. I come back to watch this video at least once per year. Not just to reinforce concepts, but to also admire how eloquently Dalio explains the economy :) You will never know why I got these likes @John Yohann It\\'s obfuscation. View the detail of the *truth* in the video, *The Creature From Jekyll Island (by G. Edward Griffin)* @Teknikal Edge It\\'s propaganda for the dumb masses. View, *Banking - the Greatest Scam on Earth,*  www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9IH-XKQpOI @DMC Only half of truth. @John Yohann It\\'s propaganda for the dumb masses. View, *Banking - the Greatest Scam on Earth,*  www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9IH-XKQpOI Come on- it\\'s just basic economics, 101. It can\\'t be disputed. 10:22 don¬¥t mind me, just marking the only thing i understand. what happens when there are no interest rates, just the debt? Will the economy still work? 14:16 that \"why\"... The best and simple presentation ever watched on economy ....marvelous! In a Nutshell: credit should only be used for productive means (and maybe buy your house), never for consuming. @Carlos Magno Self evidently and there\\'s also an  English saying to do  with boxing: \"if you can\\'t make the weight, do get in the ring.\" @fynes leigh first time hearing about it. English is not my first language.\\n\\nBut there is a saying in my language that comes to mind: \"I\\'m not your father\", which translates to \"do whatever you want with your life\". \"Should\" meaning you would like it if, yes?\\nHave you never heard the old saying \"should is shit\"? Carlos Magno Oh yeah, I thought you were another commenter which didn‚Äôt make sense with the ‚Äúnever Ever‚Äù advice.  Congrats on paying off the house especially during times like this, sighs of relief I bet. @Dorjee Gyadatsang I\\'m not against credit in every situation, as I said in my first statement.\\n\\nI financed it for 15 years, but being so greatly indebted was something horrible, so I struggled to pay in 5 years. Something tells me the interest rate on the bonds the central government buys from the central bank, are different than the ones available to taxpayers/general public. aren\\'t int rates zero during deleverage? can you make a new one with the outcome of the federal reserve stepping in to try and regulate and fund the government?? Who else also came here from \"Money: Master the Game\" book?  I Read it two years ago. One of most important point we must focus on is how beautiful the economy without debt would have been , A linear ever increasing regression ....Debt makes our next generation to pay for what their fathers used to spend as their extra expenditure @Chris debt with interest is always bad and in long run it is designed to enslaves the humanity as whole I think it is also important to understand that there is both good debt and bad debt. Pro tip:- watch this video 10 times probably every week You\\'ll get more in your head shiny x yeah because you know more than the worlds biggest hedge fund manager who‚Äôs worth $19 BILLION DOLLARS right? @shiny x lol what a joke...

I just wish he would\\'ve gone into more depth over more videos after this overview. Would\\'ve been a  great learning experience and fun to follow. 3:19 - the money printer go BRRRR! 2020 here, he predicted it! This what\\'s been happening the past 6 months! The cycle repeats it self every time..... capitalism is a high maintenance system I recommend everyone to watch this at least 5 times @Ali Ali \\nIt is the shortest version ever known to me and might give even to a beginner the basics about the Bank√≠ng system/scam.\\nThe other one is about 29 minutes from Mike Maloney and there are many more. Many are frauds, i mean they hide the information purposely (coz they are funded by the Bank√≠ng Cartel.)\\n-->\\nhttps://youtu.be/G9IH-XKQpOI Then verify the information with other materials and sources. @Ali Ali read adam smith and karl marx.they include everything and explain it. all the other books and lessons are workarounds for 1 problem in the whole economy that nobody wants to fix. as example you can find 100 books about the boom and bust cycle but nobody will tell you the real problem. @ECONOMICS except you and he forget a tiny whiney important detail. 1 detail that is leading to the practice you describe and that is the foundation of markets. just buy flow like i did https://tradeui.com/register?ref=exile How to become rich? I understand this from the video.\\n\\nAt the phase when the long term debt cycle is at its peak, you need to sell your assets to generate cash and you need to buy assets when the long term debt cycle is at the lowest.\\n\\nThis way you can earn more by selling assets at a high value and buying assets at a low value. Thus, the economic machine and long term debt cycle won\\'t have a big of an impact on you!\\n\\nEdit: Please comment if got any better idea than me or if mine is not accurate. Buy low, sell high. I like it. Only problem is that you don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs at the very top or when it‚Äôs at the very bottom... You\\'re right, except you need insider trading to accomplish selling high with any accuracy, that\\'s why the rich get richer. They\\'re cheating the system and everyone who doesn\\'t have a friend on the inside, hell they got Martha Stewart on that. ',\n",

Sounds good mate. Just don\\'t say Australia land or kola bear here because you\\'ll probably get made fun of by us Jealousy is a curse It‚Äôs not a city it is a country smh No go away ur no welcome Just remember Sydney is overrated Some other places I would recommend to visit is \\n1. tangalooama on morten island you do dolphin feeding , parasailing , helicopter ride and quad bike ride up a forest track. \\n2. The great ocean road that is close to Melbourne. Melbourne has some beautiful vineyards and has a beautiful coastal line. \\n2. The Whitsundays islands is honestly most beautiful thing you can see. It is expensive to stay on the island it‚Äôs cheaper to stay on arlie beach and catch a boat to the islands. \\n3. white haven and that has been voted on of the beautiful beach in the world. \\n4. Thredbo the best ski place for family and friends in Australia absolutely fun and who doesn‚Äôt love snow. In nsw\\n5. Double island point great camping place and absolutely beautiful beach \\n6. The fairy pools in Noosa in Sunshine Coast bit of a walk through Noosa national park but the walk itself has beautiful view the entire way and has small beaches on the way. Noosa is beautiful but good luck finding a park \\n7. The southern lights you can see in Australia it‚Äôs about 2 hours I think from Melbourne where you can stay in a cabin and there is a observatory for the lights. \\n8. Dreamworld , movie world , wet n wild and sea world of course all in Gold Coast \\n9. Bryon bay the vide is very chill beautiful beaches \\n10. The blue mountains outside Sydney \\n\\nThere is more but that‚Äôs all I can think of that I know all these places can be found Queensland, New South Wales Victoria ( I‚Äôm from Queensland and been to Victoria and New South Wales so don‚Äôt know much about beautiful places in other states but I do hear Tasmania and Western Australia is absolutely beautiful) I‚Äôve been to the great ocean road and the best location among it is the 8 apostles Nice u Hey dear, need your feedback about this video, this is Kashmir the heaven on earth \\nhttps://youtu.be/M_Oj6W9x0_4 Thank you for taking your time with the list.

Concetta Marino I agree with you.  It doesn\\'t matter how long I am away from Australia I will always be an Aussie and can\\'t wait to return.  At present I am in the US. Are you aboriginal  ?

Me too Australia is my dream place to travel with My wife and children If travel for holidays then go to Gold Coast, but if u want to live here then Sydney u will find work fast. @s t a r d u s t Lmao she\\'s a nutter, let her go to the U.S she\\'ll be crying nd begging to come back cos America so far behind with everything nd will shit herself after seeing the first murder/massacre with guns lol anne smith \\ninteresting!

HOPE YOU LIKE SNAKES no body says vacation here plus australia invented WIFI and chicken salt and much more I live in Canada üá®üá¶ I spent close to a year travelling through Australia it was great, All of you slagging off the English are funny. Do you realise that since the founding of Australia in 1788 until today in 2020 the largest immigrant population by far has always been the English? We built AUS when it was nothing but wilderness and now you want to slag us off once we build a country everyone wants a part of? Typical lol @PlymouthtoLeedsonaXCHST Who cares what you do. You\\'re an idiot and we wouldn\\'t want another one like you here. EDIT: I KNEW YOU WERE THE POM Bwahahahahahahaha PlymouthtoLeedsonaXCHST     Between 35 - 50,000 Brits emigrate to Australia annually, and they don\\'t seem to have a problem with being \\'slagged off\\'.  It\\'s a different matter though when they start looking down on people as they do the N. Irish, Scots, and meditteraneans.  They earn their reputation.  A high percentage of Brits came to Oz as ¬£10-poms in the 50s & 60s, they and their offspring have no intention of ever leaving @Name And Address Supplied What do say to the English,calling us poms is racists.I would never go to Australia,everyone knows they despise us even Americans have told me this.Good job we are the two furthests countries apart. @PlymouthtoLeedsonaXCHST It\\'s only the whinging Poms we have a go at. The Irish, Scots & Welsh we have no problem with. I bet you\\'re the Pom. The outback is the most amazing part of Australia. Take a drive from Broken Hill to Flinders Ranges to Coober Pedy. You will never forget it! Brilliant. The sounds, colours, textures, fauna and fawna, and scents of the outback/bush is the true representation of Australia.  Even if you are a city person to truly experience the heart and uniqueness of Australia you need to visit the bush. Toby Loebel   Been all over this great country. All the good/nice/beautiful places are literally thousands of km from anything in most cases and from each other. It‚Äôs ok if you like driving and the reward of the spectacle is big. But if you don‚Äôt like traveling by road. It‚Äôs not for you. @marvin martin its worth it you just probably haven\\'t been on the drive. Jim Crawford   From where?   Melbourne? It‚Äôs not far at all, go and see the beautiful Flinders Ranges. From Broken Hill it is a beautiful trip, I have done it quite a few times from Canberra. I can tell all the place I have been visit and living in all major capital city.

Coz its not legit. @Aidin Softiƒá Obviously, the two examples you have chosen to use, do not currently have a scientific explanation.  Just like all of the other miracles mentioned in the Bible.  But the Bible was the first place to talk about quarantining of infectious people, certain hygiene and washing techniques, burying human waste well outside of camp, stars making sound, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, dinosaurs and many, many other scientifically verifiable things.  Let\\'s not forget that automobiles, airplanes, microwaves and thousands of other things we now take for granted, would have seemed like science fiction to people from other times.  Many things that were once considered a miracle, or witchcraft, or impossible, are now considered natural, because we have learned how to understand them scientifically.

Really helpful thanks mate, subbed, going to look at Nab as I want to by some AMD shares :) the stock market is evidently the biggest market in the world, perhaps that\\'s why every economic breakdown affects its market trend. Coming from one who has been a keen follower of the stock market, the stock market trade is very lucrative but along the line you would see the world is getting set for a major digital revolution. Our local and international currencies are being taken over by digital currencies and its a fast taken route. 1 bitcoin is worth over $9000 and its still on the raise. i tried bitcoin for the first time when i came across a video of it online and since then i was fascinated by it, and i met Allen Albert who taught me how bitcoin can be managed, traded to maximize profit, on my first week i made  $40,700 from an initial trading capital of $10,000. I would recommend Albert to anyone willing to try out bitcoin and how beneficial it can be, he can be reached  on tellygram (albertrade) or Whatsapp *(+44 738 035 6836) for guidance. . Let\\'s move together, these are good times Bitcoin over dollar anyday, I use Albert services a couple of times till I got to analyse the the market for myself With time I think, more people would be more receptive to the use of crypto currencies Digital currencies sounded crazy back then, who would have believed I would be here watching videos on them and having some for myself If only some people would be patient to understand that Bitcoin isn\\'t going anywhere, instead it\\'s taking over the globe. Crypto to the moon, started using Albert signals for just a duration of 3 months on my live account and its amazing I must say, have been looking for an avenue to tell others about it Thank you so much mate, this video was fantastic and I\\'m Australian so appreciate the relevancy. :)\\n\\nSubscribed. Bro, I learnt so much from you. Awesome video! Just started investing, your videos are really helpful mate! The school wants me to watch this Has anyone else noticed he has EXACTLY the same voice as a guy who gives advice for breathing techniques for freediving?! The 4th step ought to be asset allocation Thank you so much. Maybe I\\'ll get out of my high interest loans before I start investing. I have no clue what to do Just think about the interest rates involved! I want to learn investment investing business with my family Hi mate, just found your channel. Fantastic well made video, goes into deep detail for beginners in Australia. Keep up the great work. nice video Brandon, can you do a vid on online brokerage account share analyses? just the simple stuff. \\nThe big question though, if it\\'s not magic, what is it? Personally after I traded for myself and lost all my money,Adrielhemingway has been handling my trade ever since and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend beginners to start trading for themselves right away. @Evelyn Humberman that\\'s so good I won‚Äôt lie,my first investment was pretty low,my payout wasn‚Äôt that great either but my next investment was pretty okay and my payout was huge. Having your investments handled by an expert trader will definitely put your mind at ease. You need the right amount to get started and your minimum investment should be just enough to get Adrielhemingway to trade properly for you. All I wanted to do was learn how to trade and become a good trader and I got detailed and explanatory tutorials from Ms Adriel and now I‚Äôm getting better. Hi Brandon. Thank you for the fantastic\\nvideo. Can you also talk about taxes for Aussie stock investors ? Thank you. Taxes are considered earnings and must be declared if you are earning over the combined  taxable income threshold no ones exempt , pay your taxes unless you would like a letter usually by tax department , it is a kind letter please pay A amount to the B arseholes ! If you ignore that and continue to tax dodge well they will chuck you in the big house Aussie Wealth Creation tax video is something I‚Äôd like to see too. Doesn‚Äôt really get discussed much. Aussie Wealth Creation great idea, definitely need this video Great! . Yes, I\\'m trying to collaborate for something like this! I\\'m no tax expert. I\\'ll keep everyone posted Best video I\\'ve found on this topic, thank you for the information, really well presented Mate your fantastic! Keep up the top work. Thanks Naveen!

Hey mate, new subscriber of your chanel.. Loving your content! Quick question, I have an interest earning (1.5% p.a) saving account set up for my daughter, balance so far around $5k.. Would I be better off investing this $5k in a LIC like AFIC or ARGO with DRP and leaving it there for at least 20+ years? Is that enough time to take advantage of compound interest... more so than just leaving it in a bank account? Cheers and keep up the great work! Omg thank you!!! Thanks for watching Jessie! Great video! What would you suggest with short term money goals? If investing in shares is for the long term. Subscribed! Great video, lots of value thank you mate. So helpful! Thank youuu! Legend! Another quality vid mate. Would love to hear your thoughts on  diversifying in ETF\\'s for the long term. Yeah you can definitely diversify across lots of ETFs but remember eventually you\\'ll have so many stocks that you\\'re literally just getting a market return. So you could simplify into one ETF that tracks the market and be done... Awesome video! So helpful Thankyou! Thanks for watching! What if I want to invest in bonds? Would that be under the same page? I\\'m new to this world. \\nAny help would be great appreciated. \\nThank you gail Edgar shut the fuck up You can also try investing in forex trading it is very profitable I can brag about that. You can contact Mr Cory Clinton for assistance.  Clintoncory89 at g mail .com Great video, I‚Äôm also watching you stock market jargon explained ones at the moment which are super helpful. Wondering if you have any videos on self managed super funds? I know I‚Äôm too young to be looking at that yet lol but I‚Äôm interested to hear your thoughts on them. Great vid brandon! Can I buy index funds or ETFs using the same method? Thanks heaps for this mate. I was struggling to understand it properly and you have explained it in a very simple informative way. Cheers. I\\'m glad I could help! I\\'m not a fan of the background music, it mostly obfuscate the message. Maybe an intro or outro but not over the chat ;) Poor old epidemic sound... :( Except you didn\\'t address the most important point, how do I get the charts!?!?!??!?!? Yes, commsec has a chart but it\\'s VERY limited, it doesn\\'t even give you candlesticks. The most important part of trading is being able to figure out what stocks to actually trade! I\\'ve watched like 10 videos now and NONE of them mention where to get decent charts, why??? You‚Äôre really great at explaining this stuff Cheers Simon! Good for begginer. Thanks could you recommend the best 10 companies should begginer buy please? The sideways movement of bitcoin price is totally normal and shouldn‚Äôt dissuade you because bitcoin is getting ready for a huge bounce back so what should be the trend now is accumulating as much bitcoin as you can.  irrespective of any market trend encountered as an investor profit should be made and that‚Äôs why am currently accumulating and increasing my portfolio daily through trading with signals provided by Caleb Easterby and I have grown my portfolio to 13 btc from its initial 3 btc in just 2 months. Caleb‚Äôs signals and strategies are the best I have used; his signals are accurate, efficient and gives you a consistent profit margin. He can be reached through WhatsApp (+31 635250332) or Telegram (@Easterby).  Now is the time to accumulate and increase your portfolio while waiting for the imminent bull run. @apatheticAnxiety Oh yes, Caleb has helped me tremendously! I don\\'t know how I could live without him! My god, Caleb is just the best, isn\\'t he? I would kiss that man, no homo. @ASomewhatLongAndMeaninglessUserame hey, a human!

I\\'ve got about $500 that I want to start with and have opened an Westpac Online Investing account that has brokerage fee of $19.95. Since I\\'m starting with such a low amount of funds, just wondering what type of stocks I should be looking at and whether sticking with Westpac or going with something like Self Wealth is a more ideal option? Really have enjoyed the few videos I\\'ve seen of yours so far, so keep it up! Yeah you can definitely look to other sites like self wealth to lower your brokerage. My opinion is that it\\'s helpful to look at wide diversified stocks when you\\'re starting out, but of course that\\'s up to you. What the lowest I can start with At least on a productive platform like mine beginning with $500 can yield profitably 75% returns . Hi Brandon would $1000 - $1500 be suitable for a long term investment or could you tell me what is the minimum amount people should invest for long term?? You are a ledge.

Thanks for being a great contributor to the SEO community! You\\'re welcome. Yup, the animations are key for making complex concepts easy to understand. Why you upload videos on every month? I always wait for it. Can you try to upload after one week? Outstanding video by Brian Dean.  Clear, Concise, and Creative. perfect explain - thank Great video! I have a quick question for everybody Im currently using Wordpress and I cant seem to figure out how many keywords to use and where exactly to put them so if you download a plug in that lets you edit your title tag and meta description you can also add keywords which I get but you can also add keywords on your blog not necessarily in the content but there is a column on the right hand side that allows you to add keywords then you either space them with the Enter key or a coma so I guess my question is do I add my keywords into both locations and as many as I want or just a select few? Thank you for sharing it :DD Thank you! ',\n",

Your teaching style is so clear, simple, energetic and yet very welcoming. You can teach us how to cooking, plumbing, root canal treatment, how to be a batman, etc. and we\\'ll enjoy it mightily! Keeping up the great work Eddie! Audio is so often overlooked, I totally agree with everything you said. As a teacher, I thank you very much for sharing this information.

I want you to know that you are such a wonderful young man whom I know contributes so much education not only to our younger generation but also to many others, like me.  Never underestimate the power of education, and never underestimate the many whom you reach.  Deepest thanks, Mr. Woo! Great advice! I thought about doing videos just to boost my own learning curve. This was giving me much needed perspective. Thanks! üòÉ You make me totally fall in love with maths. Tbh, you are such an outstanding teacher ever!!!

Keep up the fantastic work.\\n\\nOut of curiousity, what AV setup did you use to record this video? how did u get into uni... Thank you your teaching about equipment,editing and ubload Thank you your teaching about equipment,editing and ubload Thank you for the tips my friends ..more videos and this is very helpful. Sawubona, Eddie Woo\\nI see you, and you are *so much more* than \"a mathematics teacher\" - a Jedi insisting on Permission to Smile, I\\'d say.\\n   ; D Yes so much more. A narcissistic man who thinks he\\'s better than most teachers What I Know About You;\\nUr A Maths Teacher\\nUr From Teenage Boss I admire this mans willingness to open education up online, and his enthusiasm to assist teachers create content. \\n\\nThe issue: the majority of the curriculum is already online in numerous examples. So I don‚Äôt see why teachers should all start making videos for online lessons if they can point the student to the right video anyway. This is discussed by student teachers and lecturers in contemporary Australia. Teachers are now more of a node amongst many nodes, and part of their job is to guide students down the digital path, not to always create a digital example. If some teachers feel an intense need or compulsion to share their originality or connect their students with their individual personality, then by all means they should make content. But this should not be mandatory as essentially the time could be better used on working with students individually or connecting more original thoughts, than creating content on subject specific concepts that are already available.\\n\\nFor example, calculating an angle in geometry has not changed. There is no need for a teacher to spend 3 hours making it, editing, changing mistakes, fixing technical complications and possibly reshooting, if Mr woo already has a video showing how to calculate the angles of a triangle. If the information is correct and appropriate, point the student to the video. Excellent resource! Thanks for sharing this. Thank you for sharing your knowledge ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôè I\\'m not confused about how you did it from a technological point of view. I\\'m confused about how you did it from a time management point of view. I seem to spend all of my time on admin, paperwork and reporting :( I\\'m thinking about translating at least a few videos. Much more people should get to know you Mr. Woo. Thank you and keep up the good work. Dobra Eddie Woo, you are the man! Thank you Eddie.

Wow good contribution to your student lots of learning Great contribution its help us alot. yeee can I get a heart because I don\\'t have one The biggest mystery in math is, to me, why some people call it \"maths\", instead of just \"math\"?\\n In the US in every place I ever went to school from kindergarten to university, I never heard anyone say \"maths\".\\n Just math.\\n When did there get to be many maths?\\n How many are there?\\n What was wrong with it when we just had the one? Just a comment on the price classes we are dealing with:\\nSimple setup: around 100 $  or 200 $ depending on which mic you use\\n\"Heavy duty\" setup: around 2000 - 3000 $, as in addition to your roughly 1-2k camera you want plenty of sd cards, which en masse become expensive, as well as a fairly expensive lavellier wireless mic. \\n\\nThere are intermediate options but as eddie said, as long as you heave a great mic, the phone will deliver adequate video nowadays, especially if properly stabilized, so unless you want to go all in i\\'d stick with that. @Hushed Tones Well you only record high pixel because it downscales more beautifully.\\nI do not consider the phone to have a price because almost everyone has one that can make decent video nowadays. if you LITERALLY do not need a phone then ok i guess its cheaper to get a 500 $ camera that can accept an optic but i consider that the vast outlier. phones setup are expensive too its just that everyone already has a phone (lot of them worth around $1k).\\n\\nSD cards have become cheap compared to 5 years ago. \\n\\nIf its an issue just record 1080p.

Beery Leaked video from the UK. Listen carefully how the girl describes holding the baby‚Äôs head at 9:10, her choice of words aren‚Äôt normal descriptive words for a child that age unless they‚Äôre familiar with Satanic rituals and a family of their high standing will not be needing the work of social services and children of that age should even know the word\\nhttps://youtu.be/KNaLziA7ZiQ @Bubbs pelch What theres no articles saying anything hes not what you say he is you just want to cancel random people because you have no life You\\'ll never see Hanks in public again.

Look at his shoulder on the left,glitchy as Those are not the hands of a 64 year old... Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were both arrested in Australia and are both currently being held at a high security facility where they are both singing like Canaries in hopes of not being executed for crimes against humanity (in particular Children). They are never coming home again and will never be free ever again. This charade is meant to lure Hollywood into a false sense of security.  Nothing can stop what is coming... \"Nothing\". Tiberiusduck I wish you are right ü§û Howz GITMO treating ya, Tommy Boy? Enjoying the warm Caribbean sun, just like in the good old days @ Pedo Island? Q up the indictments. Red pills for strength.

There\\'s this black thing for a fraction of a second right before he says \"female actors\"? \\n\\nEDIT: Again at 2:19, this time it\\'s more zoomed in and easier to see. I agree, you seen something. We all did. Yo good catch Well spotted fren a strange shadow of something Not Tom.  He makes exaggerated movements with his mouth.  His brother! Deep fake using his brothers voice. \"America\\'s Dad\" ? Just like Bill Cosby, oh my. @Jonathan Esser What is \"Team Q\" ? So that part I don\\'t get do you think he\\'s forced to say that as penance? Like team Q is exposing them and forcing them to say that or do you think it\\'s just him paying homage to cabal? It\\'s tough to tell who the symbolism is for sometimes the this seems like they got Hanks. I\\'m starting to understand the get your popcorn references Hey Tom did you guys get a bad batch of Adrenochrome? anna baker yeah. Before I updated myself I was like ‚ÄúJESUS CHRIST WHAT?‚Äù Because the past three years I‚Äôve been buried in schoolwork and such. @Lori Woolford have you noticed how much some of these celebrities have aged since they cant get their fix of adrenochrome ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æüçïüçïüçï Is that his new kitchen in Guantanamo Bay? ü§î He‚Äôs not at home.

He\\'s standing in front of a green screen @Emily Do you realize how good Hollywood\\'s CGI technology is these days? It\\'s obviously something funky going on here. @Emily what do you think now?. @Emily You are correct, made a mistake. Look at his neck instead. Definitely something weird going on there. He\\'s not. When he moves his hands, it casts a shadow on the silver thing to his right Why is the kitchen a green screen???? Mike Sain seriously?  Why People thought Jimmy Kimmel\\'s kitchen was green screen too. Until he proved them wrong. Moron Look closer.....thats a deep fake. It\\'s not you can see his shadow in the back round Looks like a deep fake!  Look around his neck when he says, \"take care of each other...\" you can see the glossy superimposed face. Not buying this one!! This is the very similar feeling watching this... like watching an ex you broke up with after you know what s/he really was . Including her/his friends. The whole excitement the magic and the joy is no longer there... like looking at a stranger you once loved... just an empty box, a gorgeous elaborated box. Omg well said.. that\\'s exactly how it feels üëå There‚Äôs nothing secret that it will not come on the light ‚úùÔ∏è His kitchen has caught my attention! It is quite cheap and poor, so is his monologue. @Maria Aquos damn maria 7 comments and almost all of them are on this video what really resonates with you. Because with my 700 IQ big brain intellect I can see you really like something about Tom. Me being an intellectual have no opinion and am not biased. I was created in a lab near Massachusetts. I was created to think like a human but as smart as AI and was built by the greatest minds. Like Einstine Beethoven and others. When you die you don\\'t actually die you just go to cuba. Lots of people in cuba. Cuba isn\\'t even a place its just a big door into the second earth were the government and big pharma pull the strings and take out of pockets.

What a pity, such a nice family man, lol.

Not so funny to people who have lost loved ones, lost jobs and have no money.  We can thank China, WHO, and that ghoul, Bill Gates.  We get all your coded messages and symbols.  So we get the pizza reference.  Is that what yours is or is it hot dogs or pasta or pizza?  How\\'s that son of yours?  You did a great job with him.  Saw him in a video.  He was really \"trippin\\'.\" https://youtu.be/1-tWfEfP3MY?t=1236 shows what he did Will the real Tom Hanks please stand up?

Lisa Warren his typewriter brand name is corona.  No joke Its the most High tech thing he owns Deep fake face and green screen background. That ain\\'t him. Looking pretty bad without your adrenochrome If you truly believe that that is him then you\\'re mistaken. Look at his neck, the collar, the folds. The part where skin and collar meet. That\\'s not real. Those hands dont match those of Hanx. What is the media trying to convey here? Either he\\'s edited into that \\'body\\' and in that fake setting or that this is deepfake...  Either way, why would they need to fake it? That\\'s the question His brother does voiceovers for him. At 1:20 he bends over and you can see it\\'s his brother\\'s hairline. oumaima Z it‚Äôs CGI @The Restoration of Dr Who no Agree 100%.  Even this \"coronavirus threat\" is fake.  Lots of ultra-rich people are now in very exclusive luxury, hotels, resorts and water parks.

Yes! @No Name sad What about Switzerland and Austria? The alps are definitly missing here Italy is bordered by the Alps with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia ... therefore in reality this country has the majestic Alpine beauties of all these countries combined:) H√©l√®ne Blasquez ofc I know that. I meant the alps in general. I‚Äòm from Switzerland, so I know what you can do here and it‚Äòs definitely more than just skiing just like you said You know the Alps are also in other countries like Italy or France? and that they are many others things to see/do in Switzerland and Austria than skiing ;) No Dolomites, Florence, Reggia di Caserta, Cattedrale di Monreale? CZEch europe hiking video https://youtu.be/ENav1mzUwmw @Rob 51 You are very stupid... lolol üòÜ shut up and pay respect, nobody has insulted  you or your country. What problems do you have with Italy? If you don\\'t like it you can remain in your country, nobody cares @Rob 51 you are reeeally nice person, all your comments about Italy are very sweet. Compliments.  Greetings from Italy. You must be italian of course __Europe has got better places than italy ever will __clean and keep your country in a good state __it\\'s falling apart I\\'m surprised you guys chose places like Lake Bled and Sofia over Portugal, Poland or Austria I think the list is more oriented monuments instead of cities or landscapes. Alps or Mediterranean islands are gorgeous, I love Lisbon & Porto, but I think Florence  and St Petersburg should be in the list. And how about Switzerland? ü§î You mean Hagia Sophia? The largest structure and largest hall in the world for more than one thousand years, and a groundbreaking architecture type for someone that knows evolution of the architecture and the built environment (first time the Roman basilica and circular roman structures (such as Pantheon) were united in one structure through engineering innovations and at a great scale) It is a clear choice, no surprise.\\nEven more surprising? most of the structures even smaller ones in history even one thousand years later were built in more than a century but the Hagia Sophia in 5 years. Not only because of recources, but also because Anthemius of Tralles the mathematician was expert in logistics. So it was a logistics masterpiece as well etc etc.\\n\\n\\nThere are places that should be at least mentioned as contenders or close calls though, at least ten.\\n3-4 of them for me out of the sights I know would be:\\nToledo in spain, \\nRoman Agora (together with the Colloseum) and the Pantheon together with those, \\nSantorini, \\nFlorence, \\n(if Anatolia peninsula counts) Cappadocia together with the Byzantine christian villages in the rocks, \\r\\nthe Alps as a whole,\\r\\nCinque Terre\\r\\nSenbrun palace in Vienna?\\r\\ncanals of St Petersburg\\nVolcanic formations of Iceland, \\nKnossos perhaps (together with Akrotiri), \\n\\nNational Palace of Pena or Belem Tower in portugal, \\nwhite cliffs of Dover, \\n\\n\\netc In my opinion ... you miss Florence and Mine Salt in Cracovia (Poland), both better than many location you  mentioned.... Gilgit Baltistan is reopened for tourism in Pakistan\\r\\nhttps://www.myinsideclub.co/2020/08/gilgit-baltistan-is-reopen-for-tourism.html From Milan... how is it possible to prefer Pisa to the magnificent Florence?? best place to visit in Italy is Napoli Should\\'ve put Florence over tower bridge Im pretty sure these are opinionated Extremely tough list there would be 1000 honourable mentions but Id take pisa out.  \\nHow do you have lake bled over the swiss or austrian alps FFS? \\nSlovenian caves in\\nRussia needed more entries = st petersburg, golden ring, sochi.\\n\\nWhere are the greek islands?  Best beaches & water in europe If you considere beaches, then you have to make a longest list.

I love that house, and her decor and furniture too. Unfortunately she sold it in late 2018...and then today I read that a lot of people have been moving out of Beverly Hills because a wealthy criminal class is moving in--rappers, cartel gang honchos etc. and ruining the safe, nice vibe. Sad. I feel sad because I feel like I can see her questioning everything she\\'s saying :( i could hear her talk all day lol. taylor is one of the most humble and genuine people out there ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è ‚ÄúThe coolest thing I think in this room is the fireplace‚Äù\\n\\n\\n\\nGrammy next to her: Am I a joke to you?

Everyone knows @M V yea she even wrote a song about that. Not necessarilly. Ive always had the same answer to that question, but luckily, dont have anyone close who\\'s sick.

And those double jointed elbows lol. Plus she\\'s a first rate singer and songwriter. I\\'m a big Taylor fan. @Tuts TheCat I\\'m not a Taylor Swift fan, but I\\'ll day this: she is in no way a bad singer. She\\'s known for her unique ability to convey a whole story through just a few lines of music. Yes, her vocals aren\\'t the best, but that\\'s part of her charm and persona. She\\'s meant to be accessible, that\\'s part of her vibe and I respect that. Tuts TheCat Having mediocre vocals and light head voice doesn‚Äôt make you a bad singer. Good singing is not about high notes, it is about having a unique and pleasing voice. All vocalists are singers but all singers are not vocalists. Taylor has that voice and thus she is a good singer, perhaps listen to her recent albums.  \\nPeace‚úåüèª @Tuts TheCat So then critics also say her writing isn\\'t just alright it is one of the best abha singh she was named artist of the decade based on her contribution to the music a industry as an ARTIST not singer. Being a singer doesn‚Äôt make you an artist! Writing your own music and creating your own music does. Stop getting defensive over someone who wouldn‚Äôt shed a tear if you died today. Learn to not take everything as criticism smh @Tuts TheCat yes not best singer yet she won Artist/Singer of the decade award. Shows how bad of a singer she is or maybe other peoples are crazy and you are the only genius.

       " 'I love how in this video the dogs refer to their owners as \"dearest human\" but in Sad Cat Diaries they refer to us as \"the authority\" @Audrey Orozco cats are like humans they  arent all mean they have different personalities, dogs usually have 1 out of 2 and dogs arent mans best friend man is dogs best friend You know how cats are! That\\'s why dogs are man\\'s best friend! @Zail in response to your reply.... I say \"Woof, woof\" and a \"grrrrr\" and finally \"ruff, roff\" \\nFr. A dog lover yeah cause dogs love unconditionally and cats are \"gods\" who dont wish to listen to any mortal man OML SO TRUE I find it funny that when writing from the perspective of a dog or whatever it\\'s assumed that they don\\'t know how we do things like poop or clean ourselves. Because I had a ferret that not only figured it out, but also tried to mimick me. She figured out that I poop and pee in the toilet, so she started pooping and peeing around the toilet instead of her litter box. I had to put garbage bags down to keep the floor clean. She figured out that I clean myself in the shower, and while she still groomed herself like normal, she\\'d play this game every morning where she\\'d run around the outer edges of the stream of water trying not to get wet. She was never successful. But then I\\'d put a towel down for her afterwards, and she\\'d rub her body on it, and sometimes would even grab an edge with her mouth and roll to wrap herself up in it - basically trying to dry herself like me. She also went from sleeping on top of blankets to sleeping under them with her head (and maybe a paw) sticking out, because that\\'s how I slept.\\nShe was the cutest and sweetest little goober ever :3 Also I will join the ferret revolution if at least one of them have a little hat on I wants a ferret even more now You\\'re speaking in the past tense \\n\\nRIP little ferret Well, ferrets have good hearing if you know what I mean I, for one, welcome our new ferret overlords This video is too much for me,I must pee on the bed Stolen comment For comfort of course I\\'m moved to vomit in a shoe. No u must not For comfort... You know scientists did actually propose an idea on why dogs chase after balls when we throw them. Perhaps they don\\'t chase the ball and bring it back because they enjoy it, but maybe they bring them back because they think WE enjoy throwing them...\\n\\nThink about that next time you doubt a dogs love for man... I would NEVER doubt a dogs love towards a human, it\\'s the other way around pretty sure its natural instinct cause wolfs chase things that move... and usually bring said thing back to the pack pretty sure if you throw a squirrel in a field the dog will go after it and bring it back.... the same way a wolf would\\n\\n\\n\\nnot alive @Amy Franklin Did you enjoy having the dog\\'s company and playing fetch with him? last year i was on the beach very tired and miserable, and a black dog bought me a ball and let me throw it a couple of times... do u think he showed pity on me.. lol I mean it\\'s a really sweet theory, because that means both parties enjoy it solely because they think the other does.

I\\'ll be sharing this one around for sure ‚úägreat break down Don\\'t mind me! Just leaving a comment to help the Channel. Hello there, may you please ask me on one question, so, I was doing a lot of pull ups ,like really lot of every single day for 2 weeks and I was not aware of possible consequences. One day during my workout( I am  barely19 years old , 185 cm and 72kg) , I felt a bit sharp pain in my middle to upper back, middle the most, and I didnt take it seriously so I continued for a bit and the same day in the evening I was doing 5x per 5 seconds  exercise hold known as L sit. And during that I again felt sharp pain but this time much stronger and sharper  and I handled the pain for 5 more seconds and I was done with my mini workout routine. After one week of strong sharp pain that occurs while taking deep breaths and coughs and bending my body,throwing something with hand and on sudden moves  and lowering my body down to try to touch my foots I went to psychotherapist and he gave me deep and painful massage and said that I have probably pulled some of my back muscles and he told me it will go away during 10 days max. , one week has passed away and it didnt go away at all and I consulted a bit with my father(I have divorced parents so  he didnt know) who has recently finished 3 month massage course he told me it is probably little muscle rupture and the WORST thing that I can possibly do is go and take deep massage even tho psychotherapist on first look treated me with deep massage, so I stopped visiting him! But he told me to not train and to have minimal little physical activity which I did,just like bicycling. After 2 more week I went to orthopedist and when I came there , he was touching and checking my back for any pain but I wasnt feeling anything at all because I came relaxed and without any activity.(When I warm up or run for 50 meters,after that I will feel pain during some regular moves at which I dont usually feel anything).He told that it may be pulled muscle,muscle rupture and also told me that it will go away for 2-3  weeks. I waited again. It can last from 1-6 weeks he says , depending on severity of injury. Now that has passed away and now since my first day when I got sudden pain already 2 months has passed away, it happened in start of February and now its April , exactly 2 months and I still have injury, I dont feel any pain at all and I can run like few minutes I think and do all daily activities and everything normally but yesterday i was just shooting ball with leg , like playing football 15 minutes in my garden  even without running, with my friend ,and when I came home that day I was feeling slight pain during deep breaths and faster walking again,so the injury isnt healed yet, after 2 months succh easy  activity managed to hurt me(wow), so I am thinking like have I complete muscle  rupture since everyone says grade one lasts for 1-2 weeks grade 2 lasts 1-6 weeks and grade 3( complete breakdown-rupture)  can take few months and now I am slowly starting my 3rd month(first day of 3rd month). The problem is I do not know is it muscle or tendon, thats huge. And If its muscle I dont know is it trapezius , lattisimus dorsi, or is it maybe infraspinae or is it tendon!!. Now because corona I cant go to X ray so I can 100% know whats going on and 2 months is long period  and I am still not 100% pain free, I know after I become pain free I still should not train for 2 more months and let it fully heal and recover, but can my muscle or tendon heal on its own beccause I do not know the severity of injury but it still lasts and since I have it for 2 months thats some serious injury . When I google some pictures my pain point is exactly on place where trapezius is beginning and latisimus  as well so I cant figure out which one, Its under my blade , on the middle of body(width),so under shoulder blade and then closer to spine. I wish I can email you to draw on internet pictures the exact point since I am desperate to find out whats going on. Can you somehow possibly answer me is it trapesius or latisimus  or something else or tendon, or even intercostal muscle because it perfectly describes sharp pain during deep breath and during cough, sneeze , but pull ups cant cause it so... Now and already last 2 weeks I am pain free but as soon as I do some mini activity for 10 minutes after that I will a little bit experince a bit of pain until evening. I dont know is surgical operation or rehabilitation program necessary. ( muscle pull, tear or rupture and is it trap or lats or something else, or is it tendon and is it complete rupture or no ? I cant aswer those question no matter how much researches I do and spend time on internet. I know this is huge message :( , somehow try to help me , Corona doesnt let me go anywhere. I am writing you  from Croatia by the way... Love your videos and your knowledge! Daniel, can you please make an informative video on unilateral training? Not on it‚Äôs benefits or progressions to build up to it, but why it‚Äôs progressions are very limited and why you favor bilateral movements more. For example, I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I can do archer ring push-ups, archer ring dips, one arm push-ups, and archer ring rows and now I‚Äôve moved back to the basics doing them weighted to better be able to measure strength gain. Can you please discuss why you favor bilateral training, why unilateral training has limited options for progressions, and if strength on unilateral movements is maintained/strengthened when resorting back to doing the basics weighted? As usually, top quality video! Love it!!!! Congratz on 1mil. Daniel, i\\'m here since few thousand subs!!! üéâüéäüéâüéäüéâüéä Hey Daniel can u do a video on improving grip strength Love from India bro, I found your channel today and now I am a follower The bird dog is funny when you first doing that.

These workouts are harder than they look üòâüëçüèΩ what rest time between sets would you recommend? Hi, great video! Should this workout be done in a circuit or in reps and sets method? If only i had found this 10 minutes ago when i was working out How often I should train abs ? Looking amazing guy..üòÄüåàüôèüòÅ Thank you for this video, I was looking for an actual routine to follow to strengthen my core on my rest days! You delivered : D By the way do you have a specific rest time between sets? Great training!! 1.000.000 subscribers - congrats! Keep up the awesome work! Nice Workout üí™üí™ Most excellent video, as usual! Hi Daniel.  Great workout and I\\'ll add that into my new block that I just started this week.  I\\'m just interested to know if that was your own full ROM on the bird dog or if you do have a bit more shoulder mobility?  If you have more mobility did you cut it back intentionally?  It just looked like the arm could go a little higher to create a straighter line with the spine and leg.  Interested in your opinion on best form.  Cheers champ. How do you correct muscle imbalancies, especially back muscles? Could you make a video about on this topic? Thanks for sharing the workout. What would you suggest as a replacement/progression for the last exercise? Daniel can you do a video where you cover ALL the Ab exercises YOU SHOULD NOT DO? You look like tom cruise :) Please also expand thoughts on your nutrition. It is very difficult to achieve the physic like yours without proper diet. Best regards! ‚ô•FitnessFAQs Awesome! ‚úåüèºüòéüëçüèº Every other day or everyday for this workout ? can you pls manke a video on how to strenghenth the elbow pls That front lever plank is something else, never felt my lower \\nabs like that! It is because you have to squeeze them in their longest position. The harder you push down the greater the stretch on ur upper quad tendon. Squeeze the ass together evenly and push the hips forward and down it is amazing. üî•üå∂Ô∏è Great video! Is this wokrout done in circuit or? You need to make follow alongs! @fitnessFAQs daniel can you plz do a video about cervical  spine exercises I was working out at a local park here in Florida and a guy asked me where he could get a set of TRX straps,I told him,and he said he looked everywhere trying to purchase any free weights (including dumbbells), but said that there were none available at all. It\\'s nice to hear of people improvising. Keep moving forward ! How would you incorporate this into an existing workout routine like an upper lower split? Would you split it into 2 and add it to each workout or would you had this as an extra day of training or even treat it as an active recovery? How much should i rest between the sets? Is it a circuit workout ? @Len J Actually it does not differ from rests that you use for other muscles, you give 1-3 min rest, if you can perform well enough give yourself closer to 1 min rest, if you are getting really tired the go to 2-3 min rest, those exercises might seem easy, but they are not, take your time to recover, especially your breath Good question - does anyone know? I suspect short rests and keep going as a circuit is what he meant Sir can you make a video on cool down and how to improve muscle soreness Boys: Watches entire video\\n\\nGirls: 5:03 Hello!\\nWhat shoes are you wearing? Realy realy like the way they look :) Maybe  New Balance Minimus 20v7 Trainer Toilet-Paper-Joke. :D do you recommend side rises instead of side plank? Toilet paper. You will be lucky mate! Close to 1 million brooooo Extra tips Front plank: \\nClench your but cheeks like you are holding a single sheet of toilet paper like your life depends on it. why? :( TheNorman Hi...!!! Your video and tips are very usefull... plz guide me that how can I reduce my waist... remember my right knee can not bend completely. Plz tell me in simple english I am waiting your reply üèãüèΩ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èüî• How about rest?! toilet paper everywhere except in the market... üòÖ Does this work the obliques aswell? I m waiting for the chest exercises ü§ü @Isyankar 47 what ups? Looking forward to that too Ever heard of push ups? there are quite many chest workout video in his channel Do you have a video about exercises to treat upper back pain? Your request is far to vague...is it muscular or skeletal? What is your posture like? How do you train, what type do you use? What is your job? Rest between sets? üëçüèΩ What is the perfect time to train your abs? You can train a muscle group again when it has recovered. If abs are your main goal, you should probably just work them out as soon as you have recovered. Every 1-3 days depending on how intense your workout is. Any rest between rounds and sets ? what do you think of weighted abs training in the gym. Like weighted flexion, and weighted leg raises and reverse crunches? Do you think that is needed? how can i get 10 abs bro  ? Im trying to achieve the dragon flag, will this help me if I add them to my workout? Yes this will give you the base level core to do the progressions to dragon flag Make your videos intresting to watch,i slept at 1 min 30 sec üëç I just got recommended to your channel, can\\'t wait to try out this exercise, I want to get a stronger core and flat stomach so I\\'m really excited for this, thanks! @Borjan Koprivnjak are you trolling? daniel is 10 superior to Chris in every aspect... The amount of nonsense spread by Chris is staggering exercisesJust visit chris heria channel and thats all he is the best for abs e this works. hoping to buy rings in the future a \"Bird dog\". lol ',\n",

Hope you all have an amazing day! I still can\\'t get past 3 - stars, any advice? Man you can play the piano. Just sit a d turn to front it. And press A. I don\\'t have twitter or discord but if love to show you my island it\\'s five stars and I\\'m so proud ‚ù§Ô∏è can message you on Facebook or Instagram? @isaac Bug Hey, at least you have five stars. I only have one... :( No I need to stop watching these vids, the more I watch the more I realize my island is hot garbage I\\'m jealous and don\\'t want to put in the work lol @StrawberryGirlKairi Right? I feel like that every time I watch a first 5-star island tour. When I watch these kind of videos I (almost) feel bad this is so true T_T Same. And it just feeds my addiction to get things just right. Look away. We gotta look away! lol i dont know why but when i look at other people‚Äôs islands i feel like they have a much bigger space to work with. like my island feels like an ant compared to them @Orion Cornelius there\\'s too many downsides of teraforming it all flat for me like I have a staircase up to my museum plot of land and also a cool higher plot of land for a performance area surrounded by a stream of water connecting to a waterfall behind my house... Just looks nicer imo. But I also hate city builds, much more interested in a rural setting or something more moody and less \"LOOK AT ME I\\'M HERE AND I EXIST\" feeling. @daladorous yup. Right?!? @daladorous yeah like honestly I prefer islands with better terraforming over a lot of stuff Jorge Ortega yeah I recommend starting at the entrance then work at the plaza,neighborhood etc. My goodness, I so want to live there Ok like everyone knows this island probably makes you feel really bad at Animal Crossing.\\n\\nBut you should always just be proud of what you‚Äôve done. Because you did it, no one else. I NEED THIS HAHA I\\'m currently proud that I pathed my whole lower level All For One&One For All man it‚Äôs just animal crossing üíÄ it‚Äôs not that deep Soccer Boy You don‚Äôt need to time travel. You can make a lot of bells just by selling fruit that are non native, and then slowly cataloging all the items. Nookazon is a game changer. All For One&One For All - Yikes. Cynical much. If this is your outlook on life then what‚Äôs the point to anything? Me: *goes to Isabelle*\\n\\nIsabelle: ‚ÄúYour villagers are saying that there is too much stuff lying around, 2 stars.‚Äù\\n\\nMe: Looks at my crafting corner that is lined up with every single one of my crafting supplies YUP!!! There needs to be a durn shed for storing things! Duh!! dia _King \\n\\nIt‚Äôs Kaos from the game Skylanders. \\nThis picture is from the Netflix series Skylanders Academy\\n(It‚Äôs spelled Kaos not Chaos for some reason, lol) Who is your profile picture of? Thanks both of you XD I‚Äôll go do that Just put them in your house storage and have a crafting table, I find it easier  to go to my house dump all my stuff, take what I need etc Before watching this: Yeah my island is fine af.\\xa0\\nAfter watching this: What did Isabelle smoke when she gave me 5 stars? ü§£ü§£ü§£ Meanwhile my island looks like a giant garage sale with random shit everywhere cuz I\\'m out of storage NasserFeed mine too Congratulations to you, i literally am convinced that it\\'s impossible to fill up my storage so I\\'m just giving up on getting that nook miles achievement lmao. I\\'ve tried but bro how tf do you fill 1,200 spaces of storage. literally same and im a hoarder and dont wanna sell any of it lmao Nasser Feed you cant try Puting it into the storage in the house or maybe you can put it in the very corner of the island that you don‚Äôt use Before this video: \"Actually I love my island, it\\'s really coming together,\"\\nAfter this video: \"Ok, plan change, I need to redo EVERYthing\" ive come to terms with these islands are meant to be a representation of you and what you like. I stopped trying to make these crazy islands and just make what I like. Yo this was exactly my reaction, but trust it really really inspired me. Right after this I redid my whole island and now have a five star and I actually feel good about my island now lol DasPikachu me looking at my trash ass island I was so proud of üò≠ I just got 5-star today, I spent hours making really big paths and chairs and everything. I see this already knowing my housing isn‚Äôt great, then after watching more now I see that most of my island is wasted space, poorly optimized, or is inaccessible. I have a huge lake area up some stairs and there isn‚Äôt enough room for furniture around that... Heck my housing has an incline that isn‚Äôt even really needed. I may eventually time travel cuz of this ∆™(Àò‚å£Àò) É It kinda bothers me that she‚Äôs trying to lead him around but he just won‚Äôt follow her! He goes on his own! I feel like she probably had an order she wanted to show things but he just kept going his own way he asked tho and shes just following hell yeah i find it quite disrespectful I think he always asks the people first if they want to lead him or let him explore himself Free idea for others to use: Start new accounts and turn their houses into additional shops. (Bookstores, restaurants, etc. etc.) The fake character can be the one that ‚Äúruns‚Äù it. ...!\\n\\nCYD! YOU BETTER MOVE OUT Excuse my ignorance but how do you move additional people villagers into the town?? c i v i l i a n #1 I would love to see that satanic church actually genius CaronDriel tell this to new leaf players ü§©ü§©ü§© This island is so cute! I don\\'t think I could ever build anything like this. You need to give yourself more credit. 1 week into quarantine: what is the person called who seats you in a restaurant? a receptionist? is that it? I love these islands, but after a while all the \"zen\" and \"japanese\" gets repetitive. They all start to look the exact same I wish one day we‚Äôll be able to cook in AC. I mean, fishing, foraging, catching bugs, all relaxing activities. Is it just me who finds cooking enjoyable and relaxing? Campfire grilling, oven cooking, pan frying fishes, blending fruits for juice. No need for hunger or stamina system. Just cooking for fun. @Cookies & Cream PETA was complaining? Because of fishing in Animal Crossing? Don\\'t tell them about Red Dead Redemption 2... But seriously, the more they act on stupid things like that, the less I take them seriously. Prussian Eagle Oh yeah, good idea. Now I can feed my chicken some nuggets and my cow a burger. Also PETA was complaining about catching fish and donating them to blathers, they would go nuts if you could cook them. @Prussian Eagle LOL then you can have fat villagers xDDDD Yeah I wanna make like a McDonald‚Äôs or something in my island. It feels more urban. Plus with cooking I actually feel like I can escape from life and live on another world. It feels more realistic ya know what I mean? The whole wedding area is beyond amazing if my wedding doesn‚Äòt look half as good as this one I will riot Lmaaaaooooo @Jaime Wissner Not necessarily....man made waterfalls are not as loud as natural ones...unless the builder gets massive pumps. A lot of water has to be moved to create that kind of sound. And the design can be altered so the water cascades down instead of falling. Besides you wouldn\\'t want the water to fall anyways because it would splash to much. But think of the sound from those waterfalls. It would kill the audio from the videos @RadenWA Actually that could be created....costly but I could...or another engineer/contractor can build it. This seems like 500 hours of work to me lol, I\\'ve got almost 100 hours and basically nothing to show for it Literally same hahaha. same, i have 152 hours of work and i still even havent had the kk concert The only thing that makes me feel good about this video is knowing I have never time traveled... And that\\'s why my island doesn\\'t look this good. (Lol my island will never look this good) It amazes me how people do this i cant even imagine doing this üò≤ Chimp easy with an island generator and a hacked nintendo switch Tbh if my wedding gets canceled to hell because of The Rona‚Ñ¢ I might as well just get married in Animal Crossing instead Gitgud Corporation that‚Äôs so sad ;( @Gitgud Corporation Oh no im sorry. :(\\nYeah it sucks, did you have postpone it? and move the venue and vendors around? thats exactly what happened to me lol. My wedding was supposed to be today, in Seychelles lol I feel like you should be in a discord call with the people who own the islands so they can give you a tour and tell you things about it For real! @tobi your a savage, classy......(continue it) i was just looking at my notifications and i have 2.4k likes????? crazy Omg yessss!!!!!!!!! I need the D E T A I L S I don‚Äôt like how he just runs off. They put some much time into the island, he should let them give him an actual tour. * Watches a five-star island *\\n\\n\\n* Sees why his island is only three-stars. * My island is 5 stars and looks like a garbage dump compared to this. I need to stop watching these to save my self esteem  but I can‚Äôt Imagine having your wedding there and the pastor just shouting in a microphone so everybody can actually hear him. Waterfalls are kinda loud xD SO WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY! One of my favorite islands I seen!!! Gives me inspiration!!!! Not a time traveler so it‚Äôs going to take awhile but that‚Äôs kind of fun for me. HAPPY ANIMAL CROSSING EVERYONE!!! Am I the only person who still loves the simplicity of the older games, like Wild World? üòÖ I just find this way too much @Gitgud Corporation Or just make your Island very simple. That\\'s what I\\'m doing, I want it to be more natural and spaced out. @ella with all the different colors of furniture its harder than ever to get the items you want to decorate with i think the worst example of it is the outdoor design items they give you where you redeem nook miles theyre basically locked into whatever variation you got when you created your island for example the vending machine and streetlight they can both come in a handful of colors - i personally dont get why you cant customize all items diy style that have various versions i feel like barely any furniture is manually customizable, i fill up my inventory with furniture items then attempt to customize something just to set myself up for disappointment every time Carla B. ‚Ä¢ you can still play the game without trading though; it just makes it easier to obtain things like furniture to decorate your island with, art and fossils! i like new horizons because you can play however you want; whether it would be designing paths, finding the best clothes, playing the game vanilla without trading or time travel, or making an amazing 5-star island with designated areas and lots to see. that‚Äôs the fun of the game~ AliciaGaldon you are not alone. My daughter is into the trading and discord servers and things and I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. I miss having a game where you buy it and it has all you need to play it. No need to trade or do anything extra. There\\'s a lot of islands that try to replicate that natural look. Because sometimes islands get too cluttered (specially with those fake paths that I personally hate) This island looks alright, but seems way too cluttered to me. Like she focused more on aesthetic than things being actually functional. Example is all the chairs you can\\'t sit in and the fact there\\'s no mountain top river so how do you get those specific fish? She‚Äôs technically done the game so she does not need it to be to functional The best thing in animal crossing is fishing so if you can‚Äôt fish I‚Äôm out I love the way these islands look as a visitor and appreciate the hard work behind them, but I agree. I personally wouldn\\'t want mine to be as cluttered, it makes me feel claustrophobic and overwhelmed somehow. Alright?? It was beautiful @CaptainX weeds, I don\\'t think so 9:27 \"We\\'ve got some more stalls here with yeeting areas...\"\\n\\nCan\\'t have an island without those. TagBack: All the little things to have that look like there\\'s people here is just so...\\n\\nMe: Creepy \\n\\nTagBack: Cool!\\n\\nMe: Cool! Five star islands are lit but one star islands are where it\\'s at because you know all they be doin is fishing like me lol Matthew De Matos yeah! People say they take pride in not time travelling and shit like ?? Same game different styles, it‚Äôs not an accomplishment not to time travel and it‚Äôs not a bad thing either I FEEL SEEN AND VISIBLE LMFAOOOO lmao yeah, I can relate to that ! Username?? And that‚Äôs totally cool! Time travellers aren‚Äôt going around shitting on people who don‚Äôt time travel, it‚Äôs the other way around. Beautiful island, but I feel as though there\\'s too much. I prefer simplicity, so this feels a bit cluttered to me. @Strange things are happening to Woody from the way i see it there was just a whole lot going on like if i wanted to quickly traverse my island and it was styled the same way as this one i feel like id be running into furniture/other obstructions just trying get to where im going it doesnt seem practical to me feels like too much of a good thing overall (wont deny the hard work and creativity put into making this though) Turtles what‚Äôs wrong with the pathways??? Lmao I would love if it was a bit spacier. But the wedding places and the little houses were so cute Agreed so many poor design decisions on this map and just poor pathing. Most furniture seemed more for aesthetic and wasn\\'t actually functional. this is the best island I\\'ve seen on youtube. so creative and beautiful without being over cluttered. also nice change of pace to see some different designs compared to the norm I see. I really need to buy animal crossing lol. oh and a switch. I‚Äôm going to have three sections to my island, I have figured an idea where the area you enter the island will be where the shops and other buildings will be.\\nThe second section is a suburban area, you enter through a bridge and then that‚Äôs where my and residents houses will be.\\nThen the last section will be a garden. You can enter the garden from the suburbs and the town. \\n\\nI‚Äôm almost sure my idea will change but those are the plans for the future. üôÇ She: having a wonderful island\\nMe: wishing to have that island If the rumours are true about Brewster and other shops coming soon...Imagine having an island fully decorated then realising where to put the new shops and stuff lol there‚Äôs supposedly gonna be farming as well .-. rip all of the crazy terraformed islands @SuperAvocado islands are never completed haha there will always be something to improve, the game doesn\\'t end Well, those people are playing the way you\\'re not supposed to by time travelling anyway. So it\\'s their own fault for rushing the game.\\nI don\\'t know what they do once they complete their island like that. They restart the game I guess? Carma for lookin too gud Ruby Violet I‚Äôm hoping we can buy extra islands around our island lol... there‚Äôs so much water space üò© Check out Austin John Plays‚Äô island  he played the game fully raw without time travelling and has a 5 star island and its actually amazing Imagine how many bells this person put into this. I love the fact she\\'s done all this without using custom designs :D I think it actually makes it more impressive! AngelConfetti oh shit I didn‚Äôt even notice that. Amazing! I need to stop watching these videos because I AM NOT starting from scratch. I\\'m so happy to see an island that isn\\'t dependent on cherry blossom trees/ pastel colors. As much as I love those aesthetics, this is one of the most creatively designed and appealing islands I\\'ve seen! Kudos to the creator! This island made me feel so bad about the trash I\\'ve been working so hard on.... Imagine trying to get THAT many iron nuggets üò´ how do y‚Äôall have that much time ü§Ø It\\'s kind easy if you hoard tons of iron nuggets in the beginning. How could anyone dislike this. This island is absolutely INSANE! But in a good way! \"about to get married, very scary\" hahahahahahahaha! 160 hrs already and mine not look like this üòî * edit I know have 200 hrs and it still the same lmao * @Leah Uzumaki You are manipulating the game mechanics and use it to an advantage with isn\\'t intended by the developers as the normal way to play. Even Nintendo tried to prevent timeshifting. So, it\\'s basically cheating. But since it\\'s more or less a singleplayer game and a game where you can use any mechanics for your own creativity and way to play, it actually doesn\\'t really matter. I cheated myself by timeshifting several times, too. But that\\'s my way to get the game flow and progress how I desire. Time traveling is Not cheating, some of y\\'all never played animal crossings and it shows Where did she get all the ressources and bells to build all this in such a short time? I play every day and I am not even close to this amount of island detail. She also has tons of stuff that costs lots of Nook Miles. @Triple D I never said I time traveled. I don\\'t. @Bukowski Family ur playing the game wrong. I\\'m not saying you shouldn\\'t but nintendo never made the game so you can skip ahead and get more so quickly. However it\\'s not cheating bc this is one of those games that you can just do whatever you want There‚Äôs this and then theres my island This reminds me of my roleplaying days in Habbo or Those fake habbo hotels xD currently crying cuz im realizing how much freaking work my island needs :( I feel equally inspired and discouraged lol. Amazing Island, so much detail and thought in everything THIS\\n\\nTHIS IS TOP TIER\\n\\nBEST ISLAND IVE SEEN SO FAR HANDS DOWN I really like this one but since pretty much everyone will be going for a city like style i can only recommend you his haunted isle video. The nature style and use of terraforming is just amazing This gives me so much inspiration!! This is amazing!! wow this is definitely one of the most beautiful islands i\\'ve seen so far Imagine calling the Angelo rock the Easter island rock Meanwhile you got me over here waiting for switches to get back in stocküòê How do people get suchgood island in about 3 weeks?!\\nThis looks so good even from the map at the start Since it was out at the very beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of people had nothing to do so they played the game non stop. Kind of like what i did. you never know how much you actually invest into the game in 2-3 weeks without TT‚Äôing. Easy DaRon makes sense he had it one day before release @ya_boi_h_innit The updated shop comes after 29 or 30 days. So rather he had the game before release or he timeshifted. Release isn\\'t 29 days ago. Sara Rice thats actually not true DanTDM doent time skip and he has it She definitely time travelled, she has a fully upgraded nooks cranny which you can\\'t have yet without time jumping. \"post-wedding eating area\" sir, you mean the RECEPTION lmao I love your videos, just teasing I love these videos so much, thank you and thank towards the island creator aswell.\\nThese inspire me to work harder on my island, I want to reach my full creative potential instead of settling with, \"This is good enough\". I love the creativity on this island, I can tell how much effort went into this! \\n\\nThat being said, am I the only one who prefers islands with less clutter than this? There\\'s just so much stuff everywhere. My ialand is only 4 stars currently, and my main focus has been flowers/trees with some decor here and there. Thanks for making me feel like a damn hobo May lol You are right, it is \"receptionist.\" My favorite island you‚Äôve toured so far! The amount of detail put into this is amazing. Really enjoyed it!üòçüíñ Wow this is incredible. I can‚Äôt imagine the hours put into this. :o very gorgeous Great opportunity to improve the wedding area with the month of June rolling around at Harv\\'s Island. I lost it at ‚Äúpost wedding eating area‚Äù HOW MANY BELLS WERE SPENT ON THIS ISLAND THOUGH?! ANyone else notice the Pulp Fiction reference in her diner?? <3 In love with this island! Hey I was wondering how you become a member. I watched twice. This one is my favorite and I was inspired a lot by this island. Me seeing this amazing 5 star island : *omg I need to get on acnh right now and do this!!*\\n\\nAlso me: *wait this involves tons of money and also not being a noob* I don‚Äôt even have this much furniture lmao ü•∫ I\\'m saving up for this game and i\\'m getting super pumped up! It\\'s my first animal crossing, do yall have any tips that I can learn? She‚Äôs got a lot of items already! I‚Äôd love that Japanese stone lantern and indoor wall plants *enters a new room in the house*\\n\\n‚ÄúOooooooh‚Äù Bruhh...after seeing this island it makes me want to re do my whole island and its a five star place üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ i love that she has Stale Cupcakes by KK playing everywhere!!! my favorite song by him. beautiful. Amazing! I want to live here! Lol\\nSo at this point in the game I\\'m guessing you don\\'t actually use your island for any resources? Seems like doing \\'daily\\' activities would be hard. never thought my own island could make me depressed until watching these 5 star island videos I made a cafe in my house New Leaf, and this has given me the idea to create a better one outside!\\n\\n\\nINSPIRATIONAL ISLAND HOLY CRAP! \"it\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen a telephone pole too\"\\nMe: has 3 utility poles out :\\') The post wedding eating area lol.\\n\\nReception my love.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs called the reception. Plot twist: Those are DLC\\'s from eshop. So pretty, I‚Äôm getting a lot of garden inspo from that wedding area and bee keeper area My towns nearing completion id love to show when its done, i feel its very ‚Äúfull‚Äù Just when i think my island looks great, i realize i need thousands of more items Concuzzion Gloving what a humbling experience for us lol! I was so excited to have a park and now I see this He said what I was thinking \"I wish I could be this creative.\" Sums it all up for me. I was all happy with my island until I saw this. My island is straight doodoo logs üòê \"Words cant describe\"\\n*proceeds to use amazing as a description* HOW DO YOU GET DIFFERENT FRUITS I ONLY HAVE PEACHES AND COCONUTS AND IM DYING HELP ME PLS you trade with other people and occasionally can get other fruit in the mail Yes!  Finally someone using weeds as part of the decorations! Excuse me while I pick up my jaw off the floor. WOW. AMAZING!! The camping area and points of recreation made me feel like I was actually there in that island, it warmed my heart üòçüò© Oh my god, this was incredible. Why does my island feel so small? I need to learn how to maximize it like her. Her home is so beautiful! Well... I WAS proud of my island üò≠ The reception area blew me away! The details and how everything compliments each other kudos to those creators! She‚Äôs trying to lead him around, he‚Äôs being kinda rude and running around where he wants and bumping into her and stuff. Also. I think the island is too crowded Yo I think they be calling restaurant receptionists ‚Äúhosts‚Äù Am I the only one who‚Äôs super excited for the horror themed islands? I feel like they‚Äôll be suuuuuper cool in ACNH! @Leah Rose Thank you for the nostalgia trip ;) Leah Rose I really hope so because I feel like they can make an actual scary town now I wonder if the Aika village creator is making another one, that would be cool. I‚Äôm currently working on a sort of horror themed island. It‚Äôs supposed to be a nice atmosphere with a sort of feeling something is wrong.\\n\\nSo I‚Äôm other words, people are working on them so you‚Äôll probably be seeing them soon. :) Yes! The horror islands are always my favorite lmao i just watch these, get sad and move on lol. but i still love them!!! Whenever Tag enters the room he says ‚Äúohhh‚Äù ',\n",

Is it a foreign concept for Black men to stick around and marry the black women they impregnate? On average many White men and other races marry the women they impregnate because they have a sense of pride about family and actually try to be around for their children. Wish I could say the same for the average Black man. But then 70% of them were abandoned by their daddies too so why expect any different from them.

My partner and I went through so much torment and hatred towards each other for over a year straight it was extremely toxic, we were suicidal and doing things to drive the other crazy because we were driven to a loss of hope in humanity so often. We saw how nasty and evil we could be, because of the hurt we both felt. We were close for 3-4 years before we dated, but both of us being very generous and kind gracious people who always were abused and done very dirty by almost everyone in our lives hurt us to the point that we took it out on each other. \\n\\nNow we are strong and doing well together very much in love and harmonic, we don\\'t do things to hurt each other and we work so well together and it\\'s all genuine love. We trust each other and support one another which was a huge issue for us. I never thought it could be fixed after all the failures but love really is more powerful. \\n\\nDon‚Äôt repay evil for evil. Don‚Äôt retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with a blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and he will grant you his blessing.\\n1Peter3:9 My partner and I went through so much torment and hatred towards each other for over a year straight it was extremely toxic, we were suicidal and doing things to drive the other crazy because we were driven to a loss of hope in humanity so often.

And vice versa.\\n\\n3) Small scraps for small projects or small patches or appliqu√©.\\n\\n4) Strips and straps. This includes elastic or cording cut wrong size for the project. Fabric long but only wide enough for trim. \\n\\n5) Big scraps. Too big to throw away. Size is useful for mix and match up projects. And making small things like small drawstring bags. Can Never have enough boxes or bags for sewing stuff.\\n\\n6) Give away. It\\'s never too early to start gathering up a fabric bundle for someone that sews for birthdays, Christmas, and etc. Or you can donate to a charity that makes quilts from fabric donations. Or you can make small quilts to donate to a local animal shelter. I was thinking that also Mine are in a box or a bag or just all over mixed up Same! I can\\'t sew but i\\'m here for aesthetics. Anyone else with me? üòÖ @Paige Baizei have  no idea how to see straight. I kinda know how to sew but I‚Äôm horrible I can sew üßµ but I am also here for esthetics. You can learn @Teena Sagar I\\'ve popped over to your channel and subbed üòÉ This quilt idea reminded of a friend whose Mom made clothes for her all the years she was growing up and saved pieces from each outfit in her cedar chest.  When my friend was expecting her first child, her Mom got out the scraps and pieced a crib quilt for the new baby.  It was exciting to see when she unwrapped the quilt and remembered so many of the pieces, the Easter dress, the dress for Grandma\\'s birthday party etc.  What a wonderful trip down memory lane  that was for both of them.  Just an idea for some of your young dress makers out there. Oh wow that‚Äôs so lovely! What a great idea üòç I imagine scrap fabric to look very different from whole neat squares and stuff sedmihra You could Just sew a bunch of scraps together to make a bigger piece and then use that to make cool and unique stuff @The History Rescuer when I make a new project I started cutting my scraps into whatever regular shape I could-- squares or rectangles-- so they\\'re ready to be used later. ashhhlgh Woah! Didn\\'t know that was possible!! @RocAce exactly I know! My scrap fabrics are the pieces she cuts off I\\'m currently stuck at home during the quarantine in Italy. I had scheduled my first sewing lesson next Saturday but it got canceled since every non essential activity is being shut down, so I\\'m kinda sad and looking for cute sewing projects to do with what I currently have. I already made a couple of comfy sweaters. I will try some of these as well! How long have you been quarantined....are you going stir crazy Her Serena! I recently taught myself how to sew using classes on MyBluPrint.com! I recommend it! Ciao! I\\'m also from Italy and I\\'m getting into sewing during this quarantine. I find these videos really helpful! Serena I‚Äôm not an expert but I‚Äôve been making some dresses lately.  When I first started I made aprons and placemats. 25 years later I‚Äôm still using them.  I‚Äôve reclaimed an apron that I made as gift to my sister over 20 years ago. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that Serena, hopefully they will reschedule your lesson when all this craziness is over! Lovely to hear you‚Äôre using the time to make yourself some nice things. Stay safe! Xx Use this time stamps:\\n\\n1. Mis-matched napkins 0:47\\n2.

I‚Äôd better start playing tennis.. please don‚Äôt ever make any video where you play tennis please \\nThanks\\nI love the scrunches by the way \\nYou‚Äôre great üëçüèº Hahaha trust me, this is all I‚Äôm good at üòÇüòÇ I love the contrasting pockets! üòÑüß° *when you just collect/harvest fabrics from old clothing*\\n\"h-how can i have usable scraps??\" ik with clothing I really have to use every last inch üò≠ The ideas for a hexagon \"memory quilt\" from your project scraps is wonderfully sentimental. Xoxox\\nThe gift of fabric is a lovely idea too. Steph Krunic. The best ways to get good hexagons is to use a paper base so they are the same uniform shape. But that\\'s hand sewing and so so painful. But just look at \\'English Paper Piecing\\' if you need instructions. Thank you üß° The last one is literally just \"Don\\'t want your scraps? Make them someone else\\'s problem!\"\\nNo hate, though. This video is adorable. I think it works best when you have a lot of leftover fabric from a big project, say, a dress. So you already have a dress of this pattern, and a napkin, and some quilt pieces, and a doll\\'s outfit, and you STILL have some scraps left. And this is when they should go to a new home :D\\nHappens to me all the time, thankfully I have a couple of friends in the doll collecting community who gladly accept my scraps and exchange theirs. Otherwise I\\'d have all my apartment covered in blue velvet after this particular cosplay dress. M Chang honestly I‚Äôd be happy to receive such aesthetic fabrics aha Your scrap fabric collection is so aesthetic! I look at my pile and it feels so lackluster. I\\'m still super excited to try the scrunchie and quilting with what I do have though! Gonna try a denim scrunchie..i love scunchiesüòä It‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm always drawn to the same colour palette when I‚Äôm fabric shopping üôÑüòÇ Have fun using your scraps! Love the pocket project. Looking at a dress right now and thinking hmmmmü§î. And definitely have to make the scrunchies!\\n\\nThanks Janelle! Yay have fun making these projects for yourself üòÑüíï This ladies‚Äô way of ‚Äúscraps‚Äù is making-a-dress scrap. please don\\'t gift your scraps to \"a sewing friend\", I\\'m drowning!! üòÇ I wish I had such beautiful scraps... <3 Me to my scraps aren\\'t pretty in nz we are in quarantine for about 1 month so I‚Äôm trying to find thing to do and I am definitely going to try all these things ‚ò∫Ô∏è I think Aus will be in the same situation soon enough... Have fun sewing some nice things for yourself during this crazy time! Sending love xx I would like to see a tutorial on how to make some clothes üòªlike from scratch There are heaps up on my channel already, and I‚Äôm always working on more üòç Such good ideas now that people have to stay in! This video is so well-made! Thank you so much that you instead of just give the measurements in inches also In other news, I didn\\'t have vlisofix conveniently lying around my house, but spray-on adhesive worked a charm! Good to know üòÑ Can we just talk about how cute that outfit is üòÖ You right don‚Äôt feel like shopping like fabric at the moment . Online isn‚Äôt the same I brought what I really needed but it was just a solid colour to finish a project . I love your contrasting pockets!  I have a couple of garments that could do with pockets so will give this a try.  Thank you!\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m so happy to see someone use pins the way I do.  So many You Tube clips drive me crazy when I see pins inserted along a stitching line instead of adjacent to it so you can just keep sewing :-) All of my scrap fabric look so bad next to each other, yet yours match üòÇ Haha I had a lot to choose from! That helps!! üôà I love the quilt idea!!! ü§óü§óü§ó your videos are always brilliant! So many projects to start during this crazy time! Thank you janelle!!‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks so much! Glad you like them üòÑüíï Me: can\\'t sew to save my life\\nAlso me: ah yes great projects to do I\\' m a sewing begginer and I love those ideas! I love it so much that you tell us the centimeter AND inches ! As a German we only use centimeters. I always have to Google what inch length is in cm. I don\\'t know  but this makes me so happy! Thank you üåºüåº Perfect been staying in because of the coronavirus so I will be sewing a lot! Good idea so stay inside and sew üòä I love the colours! I can\\'t wait to add contrasting pockets to a project when I get good enough to make clothes :) Love the pocket idea. Easiest to do scrunchies I\\'ve found so far. Thanks for sharing your creativity. I have wanted to learn to sew scrunchies great info You‚Äôre welcome! Glad you‚Äôve found these videos helpful üòÑ I always make scrunchies with my scraps so it‚Äôs nice to see something new to try The \\'be nice\\' wall art is me before I go out the house telling myself not to be rude to people I seen my husband\\'s own original safari suit. He looks so handsome esp5eith his thick long white socks and coke bottle glassesüòç Love these ideas. I am going to make the mixed matched napkins - brilliant üòä Yay have fun making them üòç Girl, you read my mind. I\\'m starting a quilt today! Thank you ;) Aww lovely! Have fun making it üòç this is so soothing :,,,,) thank you for your lovely videos! You‚Äôre welcome! üß°üòä Really appreciate you saying both centimeter and inch measurements!ü•∞ About to go sew pockets on everything I own... Such a great bunch of ideas, I can‚Äôt wait to try these out! Thanks Janelle üòå You‚Äôre welcome üòÑüß° Really love this! üòç Love the color scheme of these scraps! very satisfying. and great ideas! thanks. I‚Äôve been sewing pjs bottoms and dresses and a quilt Loved all the ideas. I\\'ll try making themüòä You could also put a whole rubber band in it then sow it up instead of making one. It‚Äôs the same steps essentially. Cut fold sew band sew\\nYour just making it a loop. Putting the band on, and finishing. Scraps oh my goodness piles n piles of those  lol lol ty for sharring (smiles) What a nice idea ... the bundle of scraps. Love your projects. My first time here. You absolutely do not need an over locking machine to do any sewing by the way. This this this! I used to be so put off because I didn\\'t have an overlocker. Look into Bernadette Banner to find out some historical sewing including how to sew easy and strong seams with no machine at all! that method of doing pockets is,,, so much easier than what i\\'ve been doing???? Love the concept and projects of this video! Please do morw like thisüòç Thank you! üòäüß° Hi there ‚Äî Love this video and the creative ideas! I was curious to what sewing machine you are using? Thanks so much! I have a Brother NS30 üòä So cool! Particularly love the last one. It\\'s like \"Still not sure what to do with your scraps? Make them someone else\\'s problem!!\" in the most positive and helpful way :) Wow! Thank you for this! üòç You‚Äôre welcome üß° Thank you!! Thought my phone was ringing at first, well done I fell in love with the floral print so sad I cannot get a hold of it in the US üò≠üòÖ Nancy Garcia Interesting because I love buying fabric in Virginia when I am USA, fabric in France, buttons and crochet cottons in Spain/ Portugal. Nancy Garcia you can, there are very pretty floral fabrics in America you just have to look for it Hopefully you can find something similar instead! üß° I love these! are there any sewing projects you recommend that don‚Äôt require a sewing machine? Thanks! Just as the sewing garden said, these can all be done by hand sewing too üòä Joy Lee You could make those cute cloth napkins by cutting the large squares either with pinking shears, if you have them, and letting them fray over time. Or, you could pull out several threads from each side of the napkin so that there is a real frayed edge. It will hold up fine through many washings. You just have to make sure you are using all cotton or all linen if you are pulling out threads because those come out easier than if you‚Äôre using a man made fabric that has polyester, nylon, rayon, etc. in it. Also, those scrunchies (and really all the projects) can be done by hand sewing them. They may take a bit longer, but they will work great! Love the contrasting pockets! Thank you! üíï Nice job, thank you. I make my scrunching different but I will definitely try this method! I use my really tiny non usable scraps as pillow fill... Lovely projects! I never would have thought of the cute pockets. I love your channel. Keep these sweet videos coming!! Thank you! üíï You are such a sweetheart üíï \\nThe projects are wonderful. Thanks! And masks for hospitals! :) That‚Äôs an amazing idea!! I make coasters out of my scrap fabric ! ü§ó Love these ideas! I have a stack of scrap fabric I can put to use now :) your channel is awesome, keep up the great content ‚ô•Ô∏è Thanks so much üß° Nice to see you Janelle. Hope you stay well. Thanks for sharing this scrappy project video üå∏üåø I think you should definitely use this time to make more videos üòò Great video, great ideas tfs I love the quilt idea and I\\'m so excited to start that project. Thank you for sharing such great ideas. You‚Äôre so welcome! Have fun making your quilt üß° Thank you so much for the pockets !! It will save me a lot of time. You‚Äôre welcome üß° i used to own a hexagon summer blanket that my grandmom make for me in my childhood üòä I\\'m new using a sewing machine,  just started making face masks, loved your video!!!! I have a technical question: my top thread keeps cutting from the needle very often, what am I doing wrong? What kind of sewing machine do you have? It looks very nice, thanx Thanks so much! I have the Brother NS30 üòä Love your aesthetic and amazing video ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you so much üß° No time like this to destash! Thanks for the inspiration!

So much compact content Thank you üß° Cool ideas but sometimes it\\'s shown so fast that I can hardly follow. Anyway I\\'ll try a few of this projects. :) Thanks for the feedback üòä I like your quilt you are doing there am i your friend lol sorry i missed this video love it i am doing the 2 1/2 inch squares into a 4 patch then sashing and a corner stone from Newfoundland Canada Happy Easter dear lady Sunday Apr. 12 Great ideas Janelle! I think im going to combine 2 and make a scrap quilt/wall hanging out of all my future makes!! ‚ù§ That‚Äôs a beautiful idea üòç Thanks love xx Can you do a tutorial on how to sew the blouse you are wearing? It\\'s soo cute Great ideas to help keep our crafty hands busy while we have to kinda stay home etc!  I have a hexie little ruler guy ,you\\'ve inspired me to pull him out and give him a go . Always fun to watch as always Janell . Stay healthy üòä Thanks Amanda! Those hexagon rulers are such a good idea. Hope you start making a lovely quilt of your own üß° this is so great! thanks for the ideas You‚Äôre welcome üß° Your fabrics are so beautiful!!! How do you pick fabrics and colors to go together??? i love these ideas! i mostly buy fabric from used art supply stores, so I do a lot of small scrap projects :) Yay glad you found the video helpful üòÑ I have been given some pretty antique linen embroidered napkins but I feel like I‚Äôll never use them for that purpose. (I just got married and we‚Äôre remodeling our house so we don‚Äôt have too much use for that type of stuff right now plus I got a ton of modern farmhouse dish rags/napkins for my wedding) I‚Äôd love to learn to sew and make a pretty flowy shirt out of the linen napkins but I don‚Äôt know if I should. I don‚Äôt want to ruin them! üíñ I clicked on this because the covering for your ironing board is the exact same fabric I have in my hands right now Definitely will be trying these out! Where do you get your fabric? Such pretty designs I love them!! Most of them are either from the op-shop or Spotlight üòä I immediately subscribed caus we have the same machine! Thanks for following along üß° queen these are so cute...thank u! You‚Äôre welcome! üòÑüß° Oh the contrasting pockets! I think I have some shorts to tear apart and put pockets in them! Yay do it üòç What lovely ideas I just shared my first sewing project on my channel so I don‚Äôt have much scrap fabric yet but I love the idea of using these bits instead of letting them go to waste xx Totally! I can never throw fabric out. I know I‚Äôll use it eventually üòÑ What song is at the beginning of the video?  Btw, I don‚Äôt really see but your videos are fun to watch and make me want to go sew. Lol Thank you! My husband made this song for me üòä I have just subscribed yippieeee lol First ü•∞ These are all really unique scrap busters, thank you! Thanks! You‚Äôre welcome üß° Keep safe!

       " 'My quantum teacher was obsessed with the Stern-Gerlach experiment. There\\'s a whole chapter on it in my grad quantum book: \"A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics\" by John S Townsend. It might be worth checking out... just beware. The book doesn\\'t use SI units (very few quantum books do), so don\\'t get hung up on units for formulas.\\n\\n\"Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particle Physics\" by Eisberg & Resnick was a good suggestion in the video description. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t do a whole lot of bra-ket notation. They mostly stick to integrals to appeal to a wider audience.\\n\\nAs for my personal thoughts on spin, I don\\'t think anyone really understands why it\\'s there. I find it interesting that particles can have inherent angular momentum, but not inherent linear momentum. It makes angular momentum seem more fundamental. This kind of makes sense if you\\'ve seen the \"A Character of Physical Law\" lectures by Feynman (from 1964). In one (or the seven lectures in the series), he explains how you can get linear momentum by measuring angular momentum from really far away. If you haven\\'t seen them, you should check them out... although, they\\'re each an hour so it\\'s huge time commitment. It\\'s one of those things where you watch one lecture a day.\\xa0 When I watched them, I took notes :-) I know this comment is 5 years old, but to the commentor or anyone else looking here, could there be a type of matter that is different to matter and antimatter in the way that instead of being complete opposites in CPT asmatter and antimatter are thought to be, it is in between, a kind of neutral matter 6:52 \"electrons are not looping around\". How does she assert that as some straightforward fact? I dont have a life, so Im probably watching all of them in a day. Thanks for the suggestion. Caltech\\'s sophomore QM class studied the Stern-Gerlach experiement (and ways of combining them) instead of the double-slit. I mean they introduced the subject with the double-slit, but the detailed study was of SG. I think that is because it shows the symmetries better than the double-slit does she asked what is it, not why it is there?,,,, u took notes...........man physics seems more difficult now than before \"Not knowing things isn\\'t dumb, but pretending you do is\"\\n\\nSo true. Thanks for a great video, I\\'ll be sure to check out these questions and write a blog post. I was going to comment the very same thing. \\u200b@Bulent Basaran If you check - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing#Etymology The evidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at Apology 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also Apology 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.\\n\\nWhat Socrates actually said was - \"... ·ºîŒøŒπŒ∫Œ± Œ≥Œø·ø¶ŒΩ œÑŒøœçœÑŒøœÖ Œ≥Œµ œÉŒºŒπŒ∫œÅ·ø∑ œÑŒπŒΩŒπ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∑ œÑŒøœçœÑ·ø≥ œÉŒøœÜœéœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ Œµ·º∂ŒΩŒ±Œπ, ·ΩÖœÑŒπ ·ºÉ Œº·Ω¥ Œø·º∂Œ¥Œ± Œø·ΩêŒ¥·Ω≤ Œø·º¥ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ Œµ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ±Œπ.\\r\"\\n... I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either. [from the Henry Cary literal translation of 1897]\\n\\nSo my point is he meant that he knows what his gaps in his knowledge are. \\n\\nNow I do fully agree with you, it is not that the person is dumb rather it is the act of pretending that is dumb. If the person stops pretending, he can stop being stupid. This way of conceptualizing people allows them to grow and improve rather than internalize these tags.\\n\\nNow I do agree that it is not stupid (dumb) to not know what we don\\'t know. All of us have gaps in what we know and it is a certainty that we don\\'t know the full list of these gaps. We can\\'t know really. \\n\\nOk now coming to pretending, sure I can usually forgive them too. Lots of times they have their own reasons - they feel insecure about themselves, they don\\'t want to hear me explain it, etc \\n\\nBut the two cases you presented do not seem to be dichotomous nor a useful way of dividing it into cases. \\n\\nOften the need to hold a strong opinion on something isn\\'t something most of us are  \"aware\" of. So I can\\'t think of many real cases of 1) while 2) is very common.\\n\\nBut I do think it is stupid to want to find a strong opinion. An opinion should only be strong if you have a correspondingly large collection of evidence supporting it. Wishing or needing for your opinion to be strong is irrational. But again I do understand that humans need certainty in their life and they prefer a wrong answer to no answer. But that just means we identify our flaws and we promote good thinking. We don\\'t say it is ok to be irrational, we hold everyone to a high standard. \\n\\nIn the case of 2) we can just promote introspection, try to see when you get emotional, often it is because your core belief was challenged. It is too common for me to call those people stupid. But I think those who don\\'t fall into 2) are talented, admirable individuals.\\n\\nOk finally when we say nothing belongs to X category you are basically saying the word is useless. We define words to have meaning. So it is a fact that people have different mental capacity. We grow at different rates for sure. I am not even sure if we all have the point where we hit diminishing returns near each other. For sure people have different talents, but it is not all fair in my opinion. Some people have a lot, some people have less. There are geniuses out there, there are people with learning disabilities. I do think there are dumb people out there. Mostly we can call actions dumb and behaviours dumb and try to disassociate it from the individual, but at some point, habits form, and values become a core part of who you are. Some people are practically beyond saving in specific areas. Like I think I am dumb in fashion, I am young and so maybe I can change but it is so unlikely and I have such bad aptitude for it that I think its an accurate way to describe me. But again this is all a Truthful look at humanity.\\n\\nIf you want to teach and help people, its fine to believe no human is dumb and everyone has infinite potential etc. Lots of myths are powerful and useful when we hold them collectively. Hey Bulent Basaran I disagree @Bulent Basaran Very well said! \"It seems that we define ‚Ä¶ things by how we measure them.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of wisdom in those words. @Irish Proc well stated It ain\\'t profound @Irish Proc If you\\'re so worried about choice of frame, why not just work over your favorite principal bundle like all the rest of the modern physicists? @Irish Proc magnetic fields DO have direction. but forget about \\'lines of force\\'. the magnetic field carries force between moving (technically, spinning or rotating) charges. steady currents can only flow in closed loops. there is also force between elements of parallel currents, but that\\'s doing it wrong. ignoring the other half of the loop leads to erroneous conclusions.\\ni like the law of Biot and Savart for describing magnetic fields. for certain cases like circular loops of current or spinning electrons, the field is simple and no calculus is required. for other shapes of loops, the field at any point is given by adding the contributions of each element of current, which are vectors. the field of an element of current, at any point, is inverse-square in strength from that element, in a direction perpendicular to both the current and the radius to that point. so the field at any point is a vector sum, which is a vector. magnetic fields really carry \\'electric angular momentum\\'. same particle that carries electric field, but spinning. the spin is magnetic field. @Irish Proc you\\'re right, but terrible example. They do have a direction, fact is we made a choice about what we should call them and how we\\'re going to put an arrow on it, but as long as you\\'re consistent, if you make it go on the oposite direction of what you called + you\\'ll probably get a different result. (exceptions on even functions? things? ya know? where f(-x) = f(x) <- still wonder the relationship between even functions and even numbers) \"what is energy? What is Charge? It seams like we define this things by how we measure them\" And this is how we detect a good scientist \"Not knowing things isn\\'t dumb, but pretending you do is.\"\\nThis was one of my single favorite lines of yours so far, and so very, very true. Well, she presented the best explanation I\\'ve ever seen yet for quantum \\'spin\\': you cannot define it except operationally: \\'spin is the property of a particle that makes it do _this_ in a Stern-Gerlach apparatus\\' .\\nThis explanation satisfies a key component of our puzzlement: \"What part of quantum \\'spin\\' justifies its retention of the idea of spinning-ness?\". Well, because of her preamble on an electron going around in a circle (revolving, which is kinda-like... rotating). When the e goes around in a circle it displays a connection with magnetism. And when a non-revolving electron goes through a magnetically salient apparatus, it _still_ betrays an affinity for magnetic behavior, albeit mysteriously aberrant.\\n\\nThis tells us further that quantum spin isn\\'t simply a (dynamic) _geometric_ phenomenon, and that na√Øve expectation isn\\'t normally addressed by most \\'explanations\\', those latter leave us a with a subconscious unease that something has been ignored in the profusion of verbiage on \\'spinors\\', \\'intrinsic angular momentum\\', and the like.\\n\\nMy only criticism was the intervening material on quantum notation and eigenstates, which came out of a clear blue sky and over most people\\'s heads. It might have been left for a later treatment. Klingons are stupid, but they can still use this stuff to build their disruptor pistols. What If you don‚Äôt know something but think you do so you act like you do know something.  Are you still dumb? One of my favorite lines from any video lol Not knowing things is dumb.\\nPretending to know things is stupid Great video! Sugat Kokiloo üò≠true Eyyy Yesssss.

JoJo reference A very good video! While it definitely helps to imagine the Stern-Gerlach experiment being performed with free electrons, doing so would unfortunately make the experiment impossible. Magnetic fields interact with charged particles through the Lorentz force, which would cause an electron to be deflected out the sides of the apparatus. The original experiment used silver atoms, which have one outer electron in an s-shell (which has no orbit angular momentum), revealing that the lone valence electron must have had an intrinsic dipole moment. Ethan Jahns spot on!!! I think Feynman was right. If you think you understand quantum mechanics then you don\\'t understand quantum mechanics. and there are 666 likes right there But I don\\'t no what is quantum mechanics @Kurapika Kurta First let\\'s clarify: I talked about dizer, not mass. The central point is: atoms and sub-atomic particles are not little tiny balls. They are something between particles and waves. They are better undestood as \"clouds of probability\". There ia no direct abstraction in our world about this concept. The ideia is that there is a region with a greater probability where you may measure the electron. You may measure the electron outside this region, but as far as you go, small is this probability. This probability defines where the particle is. But, if you look at the math, you may find that for some cases, there is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny probability you may measure the electron far far away where it is suposed to be. Actually, indefinitely far away. Ok, on practice the probability tends to zero quickly, so it is on almost impossible to measure the absurd things I said. But matematically it not impossible. @Jzargo Winterhold I\\'m sorry but I\\'m a complete amateur but would love to understand more of this. How can an electron be bigger than the atom? From the undergraduate science textbooks I\\'ve read so far from my understanding, the mass of an atom highly depends on the mass of the nucleus as the electron\\'s mass is completely inconsequential to the mass of the atom. So I\\'m guessing the electron may be bigger but doesn\\'t necessarily mean they have more mass? Or does that also imply that the electron can have more mass than the other particles in the atom? I think that was a Niels Bohr quote, but yeah, you\\'re right. do you spin or you have a boyfriend? :D Starts recording a video named \"What is spin\" ending up in \\n\\n\"Honestly I don\\'t know\"\\n\"The question is more important than the answer\"\\n\"Life is not as simple as you figured in your childhood\"\\n\"Not knowing is the true knowledge\" Maybe spin is rotation on the time axis rather than a spatial one. 7:37 \"Feeling like we understand something stops us from asking what it is.\"  Perfectly put. Gyro zeppeli was here The infinitely small spin makes me think of curl. It‚Äôs literally the spin of an infinitesimal point, and is what determines magnetic fields per Maxwell‚Äôs equations. How accurate is this thought? Blimey! At last a vid on particle-spin that I could actually follow! YAAAAY!!! \"It seems that we define ‚Ä¶ things by how we measure them.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of wisdom in those words. Kyrlics exactly Lol How do we measure them if we have no definition? We already have a definition, just unconsciously. Once measured it\\'s become a conscious thing and we can consciously define it.\\n\\nOr at least, we are aware of what we will measure, than we measure it and than we define it. The particles might just be fidgetspinning. :) Looking at it, the fidget spinner actually somewhat approximates an sp2 Orbital, doesn\\'t it? Lesson 3, Johnny! Repeat \"There\\'s no way that I can do this!\" five times. Beginning of the video: I\\'ll tell u what is spin.\\n\\n\\nEnd of the video: no I can\\'t do that! Trying to answer #6\\n\\nExcerpt from \"The Universe in a Nutshell\" - Stephen Hawking.\\n\\n\"All particles have a property called spin, having to do with what a particle looks like from different directions. One can illustrate this  with a pack of playing cards. Consider the Ace of Spades. In a full 360 degree revolution it looks the same only once. And hence is said to have spin 1.\\n\\nThe Queen of Hearts has two heads. It therefore looks the same under only half a revolution, 180 degrees. It is said to have spin 2.\\nSimilarly one could imagine objects with spin 3 or higher that would look the same under smaller fractions of a revolution.\\n\\nThe higher the spin, the smaller fraction of a complete revolution necessary to have the particle look the same. But the remarkable fact is that there are particles that look the same only if you turn them through two complete revolutions Such particles are said to have spin 1/2.\"\\n\\nEssentially spin is the number of times a particle looks the same in a full revolution Its far easier to think of balls.\\n\\nA soccer ball with no markings other than the hexagons... spin... um... how many around the circumference ence? \\nWith the Spaulding symbol... spin1.\\nfeatureless sphere... infinite spin.\\nBut what about half spin?\\nWell, there are 3 axes to spin on...\\nAnd they can be viewed along 3 planes... or six if you look the other way... so I see spin half as something that rotated on two axes. Etc.\\n\\nOf course I say its the spin that is responsible for polarity but what would I know... Vinay Kumar But is this source of spin, or a consequence of spin? I thought spin was what politicians and the media do for a living üòÇüòÇ This makes sense, which is great. The best part for a layman like me was this: 7:35 (which was also great because it voiced how I feel about every science textbook \"this is how it is, now stop asking about it\") where you plainly say \"spin is what makes a particle like a magnet\". If someone had said that to me a long time ago, I feel like I would have understood sooner. It would have made more sense to me if they called it \"bearing\" like on a compass. Calling it a verb like \"spin\" would be like calling energy \"shock\" or \"burn\". How can metal move without moving it ü§´ü§ìü§üüèªüß≤üîÄ‚ôæ \"Bearing\" is such a better word for it. @Looking Glass Universe Thanks! I\\'m glad that resonated with you too. When I was making this video I\\'d spent weeks and weeks going \\'what is spin? But what *is* spin?\" and it was only when I realised this that I could be less frustrated about it. \\n\\nI like your analogy of calling energy \"shock\" or \"burn\", that\\'s a good way to put it! 1:48 - 2:48 linear algebra FTW Left is up right is down and always the opposite that‚Äôs all I can do ü§´ \"demands it exists\"?  Nope. \"demands that it exist\" the amazing and wholesome subjunctive!  \\n\\nBut your physics is superb -- particularly your very intelligent insistence that you don\\'t know stuff.\\n \\n-dlj. My answer to question 2:\\n\\n*Yes* - but at some point (after enough perturbations) the concepts of \"deeper\" and \"simpler\" would have actually switched meanings.\\n\\nIn other words, if we ask questions that require measuring observations in fractions of yoctometers, the answers will start to emerge from the activity of phenomena measured in multiples of yottameters. Spin - to (cause to) turn around and around, especially fast. There, I solved physics. You\\'re welcome. According to me e can expressed as a complex function where variables change by many factors some from itself some from others.that gives them different magnetic properties.and all I saidjust came in my mind after watching this video When thinking about the spin of a particle i\\'m rather visualizing it as spinning \"inwards\" or \"outwards\" in the sense that it still denotes a binary state of the particle, but with more emphasis on the kinetic interaction between that particle and an external event without having to refer to an external system of direction. Wow at last someone has the courage to honestly explain that we don\\'t understand spin instead of saying we wouldn\\'t understand. Thanks.. TROUBLE with the ELECTRON  SPIN:\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqyi9oX9olA We only know it\\'s what gives particles force carrying properties and charge and basically what determines if a particle is a boson or a fermion. We also know that there are other forces beyond electromagnetism and they are also related to spins and bosons and they are pretty much analogous to electromagnetism however different bosons interact with different particles in different ways. One example is the strong nuclear force, it\\'s boson is the gluon not the photon and the gluons interact with quarks not electrons or positrons.. And it\\'s a much stronger force than electromagnetism... And also the strong force does not have polarity (positive/negative, North/South) like electromagnetism, the strong force is always attractive and glues even two protons together even though they have the same charge and are constantly repelling eachother via the electromagnetic force. So basically if the gluon and the photon had a fight the gluon would beat the hell out of the photon, the gluon is just much stronger you see... But basically the force of magnets have the Photons as it\\'s force carrier we have no idea how this force carrying process happens but we know that magnetism is based on Photons, the same thing as light. And we know that gluons are something similar to light (because they are also Massless Bosons) but with some bizarre differences. But in my opinion the most bizarre bosons are the Z and W bosons because they have a lot of mass and they are something \"ghost-like\" like how light is, how can it have mass if it\\'s not a Hadron? Could it be that it has interaction with Higgs? That would mean that the Z and W bosons are almost like the lost link between fermions and bosons, the lost link between electron and photon, because they have plenty of similarities with both and if I\\'m not mistaken the W boson quickly decays to an electron and a neutrino meaning that the electron is somehow part of it\\'s composition and the neutrino can make it into a boson somehow... It\\'s really bizarre! At the moment I don\\'t understand the weak force at all, for me it\\'s the most mysterious of the nuclear forces, it\\'s the one I understand the least. Well at least we didn\\'t name it \"dark energy\" because God knows that word of made the headlin..... wait, we did name something dark energy?... oh crap, not again. Getting the right prediction is only one of the goals. Another is trying to make sense of fundamental reality. David R well since quantum mechanics tend to be pretty difficult to impossible to imagine so math really is the only way to go.\\nGetting the right prediction is after all the goal and being able to imagine it is only a bonus. Ah, I read a little bit about this in A Brief History of Time.  I still need to finish the book but I\\'ll come back later with knowledge 7:55 oh few, a definition I can remember When I was a student so fond of science, and still I am, I was so hungry for knowledge, found old style quantum mechanics books so dry and in a hurry to bang equation in your face without really explaining the background and the work that was done to reach to the equation. Some authors so in a hurry to publish This is great! I\\'ve been struggling to understand spin for a while now and this made it so clear! Thank you! This is one of the best science videos I\\'ve ever seen. Thank you for your work. Really thoroughly enjoyed this. Going to check out your other videos now and I\\'m excited! I\\'m in love with the presentation. Can you make a video about the planks constant? I thought I was the only one who doesn\\'t understand quantum physics in class. But there are soooo many people who don\\'t understand in here. \"feeling like we understand something stops us from asking what it really is\" sums up the way that people believe quantum mechanics are genuinely probability-based, simply because our observations haven\\'t proven otherwise. And why we jump to believing in \"dark matter\" rather than doubting our current understanding of gravity and relativity. Quarks aren\\'t particles, they\\'re a way to explain how particles behave, and the probabilities of quantum mechanics let us perform calculations. But they\\'re just analogies. They exist for the purpose of calculation, not to give an accurate picture of reality, but so many scientists fall into the trap of assuming the first proposed model of something (so long as it works in the equations) and explaining it to students without an asterisk. This method of teaching cannot do anything for science except hinder progress toward the truth, and it encourages complacency. Why shouldn\\'t we doubt the idea that the universe is inherently probabilistic? The only answer is that many scientists and teachers have little genuine interest in science at its heart, so they like believing we understand more than we really do. Unfortunately, it is the business of teachers to create something called \\'understanding\\' in the minds of their students, which leads them to think there really is an understanding there. In fact, they merely transmit methods and ways of describing things. Of the things themselves we know nothing - not even if \\'thing\\' is really a thing (as it were). Just one word: gravity. The Spin is simply the way my head feels after watching this video and feeling traumatized by a inner bombardment of questions springing from what seemed to be an answer to what Spin is so, we had a little talk me, myself and I came to the conclusion that Spin is simply confusion XD Thanks for the video !\\n\\nPS : Also, thanks for ruining many sleep hours to come because I\\'ll be trying to sooth my curiosity on the matter =] Enjoy ! Writing my exam in Theoretical Quantum Mechanics in 2 days, and I really like that you ask questions in the description! It really gets me thinking outside of all the math equations. You\\'re such an amazing teacher.. I am entangled with your channel till an infinite amount of time.. :-o I see - said the the blind man. I could hurt you without a slap Yano babe ‚ôæüîÄü§üüèª To the deaf woman k a k y o i n Stevie Wonder Said that Who picked up his hammer and saw. ;) Sorry man....but without a description of how the machine works, this doesn\\'t work AT all.\\nThe machine could very easily be inducing the electrons to spin on an oriented axis with the machine. They aren\\'t magnets...they are waves....and it\\'s really easy to induce something with so little energy/mass to move. The act of taking the measurement at this scale definitely taints it.\\nie. You throw a heavy magnet in the machine, INERTIA will resist the tendency to do this, therefore your distribution isn\\'t purely in regards to magnetic alignments, it\\'s also due to inertial mass.\\nAn electron is soooo almost massless........that the inertia doesn\\'t matter, and it will align to an external stimulus with VERY little influence. If you can do it with radio waves you can definitely do it with ANY external fields.\\nSo....that kinda sucks, because that explains the polar nature of this experiment versus the distribution...like I said...we NEED to know how the apparatus works. Intro (Quantum Mechanics/Spin) : \"I\\'ll explain why don\\'t we understand it\"üòÖ Okay, so here\\'s my best way of getting my head around this concept: particles have angular momentum, meaning they\\'re oriented in a certain direction (call it left/right.) So if a particle did spin, it would spin in that direction. When measuring force of particles here on earth, doesnt earth\\'s gravity effect the behavior of these particles? S is another quantum \"charge\", as +-e, +-m, +-l , +-j, ..., of the hyperdimension, multivariable, wavefunction |PSY>\\n\\naltough I agree with Feynman, as described below: \"Smaaahllah\\' foah\\'ce\" I love the physics Boston Tooaah\\'k :-) My head is spinning after listening to this video. I am now charged. okay let me attempt question 7 : How does spin relate to the Pauli exclusion principle?\\n\\n\\nI think its because according to Pauli\\'s exclusion principle, no two electrons inside an atom can occupy the same position (as expressed in Afbau diagram) and also have the same spin (as expressed by 1 1 (sorry my keyboard doesn\\'t have up-side-down 1) )........so essentially, even though two electrons may have same position in terms of orbitals, they can never have same spin because it violates Pauli\\'s exclusion principle......\\n\\n\\nOhh and also, thanks a million for these vids, it saddens me that its only now that I\\'ve found out about this channel........nonetheless, kudos on the great job ;-) EXCELLENT EXPLANATION. I want to know what do paired electron spin and an unpaired electron spin mean ? So its a ‚Äúthing‚Äù. K What is Spin ?  I think the answer is phase shift (= shift in coordinate).\\n1.  I think the de Broglie waves of multiple particles in one quantum state are connected in series, and the each wave shift msŒª at the connecting point.  (ms:spin quantum number, Œª:wave length)Let us consider a case in which two electrons are in one quantum state [n,l,ml,ms=+1/2].\\nThe de Broglie wave of 1st electron shifts +Œª/2 in coordinate. And the de Broglie wave of 2nd electron shifts +Œª/2+Œª/2 in coordinate.  Accordingly the two waves destructively interfere. \\n [the Pauli exclusion principle]\\n2.  Suppose that two electrons are moving in a single orbit, and suppose that the de Broglie wave of one electron shifts +Œª/2 in coordinate and the de Broglie wave of another electron shifts -Œª/2 in coordinate.\\nThe two waves have the shift of exactly one wavelength, which leads to a constructive interference of the wave, making it possible for the two particles to move in the same orbit. \\n[the 4th quantum number]\\n3. The variable of wave function Œ¶{œÜÔΩ•(r √óp)} in œÜ direction has angular momentum r √óp.   \\nAccordingly, the shift in coordinate msŒª change the angular momentum as follows: ml(h/2œÄ)‚Üí ml(h/2œÄ)+ms(h/2œÄ).                                   \\n\\n I\\'m sorry that I\\'m not good at English. So why do moons/stars spin backwards creating an angular problem? OMG, I\\'ve been struggling with these questions:  What is energy, what is charge?\\n\\nI\\'ve asked professors, I\\'ve asked physicists... nobody can give me an answer that doesn\\'t involve measurement as the basis of the definition. \"You came to a video expecting to be thought something about the topic at hand? No, here\\'s magnets. Now go teach each other\" Thank you for posting this video. Finally i understand what they mean when they say \"spin\\'\\'. I tottally agree, most analogys in quantum theory are more harmful than useful:  I love the part when you point out that every textbook  says \"think an electron spining...but don\\'t...it\\'s [not true]\".  By the way, spining up and down seems to me the worst name they could find for this phenomenom, because it makes one think that gravity has something to do with it. All the questions I could easily answer without google:\\n\\n2. I think a great example for this is gravity, Newton describes gravity as the gravitational constant times mass1 times mass2 over the distance between them squared. This is, of course, a mathematical equation that describes how gravity works, but not really why gravity is like that. Nobody knew what deeper mechanism was at play until Einstein came around with his theory of relativity. Now we understand that gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime. This is only one example among many of course but this is a recurring theme in science. If past results are indicate of anything, I would think that the same thing will happen for the examples you presented.\\n\\n5. I know lost of physicists describe bosons and fermions as having different measures of spin but honestly I learned them as fermions make up matter (and antimatter) while bosons mediate forces.\\n\\n11. What‚Äôs wrong with saying that an electron is infinitely small is that electrons have mass, and something with mass crunched into an infinitely small space is the definition of the singularity of a black hole. And, as we all know, the basic atomic particles are not proton, neutron, and black hole. The next part of this question, I do not know of any specific experiments though there almost certainly was one. Finally, protons CANNOT be infinitely small because they are composed of  quarks. How can something infinitely small be comprised of things that are smaller than infinitely small? Paradoxical. Thank you so much for trying to answer this question. This is like the ultimate question. What is Spin?????????? Even though you didn\\'t make it that far, at least you tried. Thank you for that. I also really like that you are trying to help push this question further along by recruiting people to start thinking about it. Thank you for that too. I really love your videos and all of your efforts to explain things in a way that makes sense. Cheers and Thanks! I love your presentation. It is so clear and wonderful to find someone asking for suggestions. I have thought a great deal about fundamental physics and have come to the conclusion that light is a wave disturbance of spacetime (similar to a gravitational wave) and that electrons (and protons and neutrons) are looped wave disturbances of spacetime.\\n\\nThinking of the electron as a looped wave disturbance of spacetime it is the wave variation in the time dimension which leads to electric charge. So the charge is distributed around the loop and the wave is travelling at the speed of light within the loop. This then gives the electron its magnetic properties since there is a circular movement of charge.\\n\\nhttps://www.academia.edu/5927513/The_Spacetime_Wave_Theory \\n\\nhttps://www.academia.edu/5038836/The_Unification_of_Physics\\n\\nRichard Can you put 3 Stern-Gerlach machines on all 3 axes (1 x, 1 y, and 1 z) with the same open space and put electrons or silver atoms or whatever in the middle? What would happen? \"Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment: silver atoms travel through an inhomogeneous magnetic field and are deflected up or down depending on their spin.\" What if the silver has something to do with the results of this experiment. Yes, silver is diamagnetic and shouldn\\'t be affected by the magnetic field, but what if the dielectric inertial plane (Bloch wall) of the magnet is causing the silver atoms to align up or down as it goes through the magnet. In this case, the electrons would be deflected the same amount every time as there would be no partial orientations. The bloch wall is the least understood part of a magnet, in fact, most people don\\'t even know about it. Some independent researchers, such as Ken Wheeler, refer to the bloch wall as the inertial plane of the magnet and is analogous to the fly wheel of a gyroscope. Let me ask you a question. What is the most important part of the magnet? You will likely say the poles. Now, what is the most important part of a gyroscope? What drives they gyroscope? What drives the magnet? No one (except maybe Wheeler) really knows how a magnet works. thank you soo much for this video <3 the meaning of spin become more and more  clear :D I wonder if we will ever find a Theory of Everything now...I was hopeful when string theory came out, we now are discovering that we have made errors in what we thought we already knew...ü§î your video reminded me of that... I call \"Spin\"  a quantized magnetic field and when it interacts will a classical magnetic field results in a force that my quantum magnetic force theory shows it to be the force we have been calling \"gravity.\" See  @ This is the first physics video, that is honest, that I\\'ve seen on YT.  Thank you for your honesty. As a pretty enthusiastic lay person, I\\'ve been waiting for this video for years. Thanks for clearing up that this isn\\'t at all cleared up :) I don\\'t understand spin but I love your voice, that\\'s something That\\'s an *Aussie* accent. I should know. I have the same accent. üòä true, really clear and confident tone :-) i don\\'t. she has so much vocal fry I have chips on the floor now. Corrina Clark Bloody hell you\\'ve been spouting an awful lot of nonsense! But even so, you\\'ve managed to stumble upon one truth that\\'s widely misunderstood- the moon indeed pulls at the whole earth, not just the water. It causes the globe to stretch, which cause displacement of water and leads to tides. \\nStill the rest of what you\\'re writing is utter whimsical garbage. You seem proud of your inquisitive mind yet you\\'ve managed to misunderstand and muddle up such a monumental amount of information. Also, just because you can\\'t do maths does not detract it from being the universal language of reality. The fact that \"simple equations\" have predicted bizarre states of matter that can barely be understood (and therefore initially rejected by the physicist), and then these things subsequently get discovered to be real, is mind blowing. Put down the zygotes, step away from your Jupiter theory, and do some real hard studying. + Corrina Clark \"Gravity is a weak force.\" Lol. I\\'m almost tempted to take this as a well-meant pun.\\nBut your statement got me to think that ultimately, Scientific research and reflection are all about dabbling in very narrowly defined fields: sometimes looking over the neighbour scientist\\'s field, sometimes plucking flowers from it, sometimes dumping compost in it. The arbitrary boundaries are \"non-existent\" in Nature itself, our minds only create them when attempting (and often failing) to understand.\\nStill it is fascinating to see that where Astrophysics end is where Classical Mechanics begin. And where Classical Mechanics end is where Quantum Mechanics begin. Et cetera... :) I really liked the video.\\nPlus, I think your attitude while explaining is just the best.\\nYou earned a subscriber. Sooooo awesome to hear this video in the voice in one of my countrymen!\\n\\nGreat video, clear and concise! THERE ISN\\'T EVEN ONE \"A\", N O R AN \"R\", IN THE WORD \"NO\". \\n\\nSay it! No. No. Try it. NOOAAR. This is fantastic! You\\'re the best Quantum Physics explainer on all of YouTube. Wow, thank you so much to everyone who\\'s participated! It\\'s been really fun to read and think about your comments. It was my birthday yesterday so I was doing things yesterday and will be doing things all of today. But after that, I\\'ll finally get around to answering everyone. Could you tell the source of the size of the electron you presented in 7:17? I\\'ve found some links that say an electron could be bigger than a proton, but regarding an atom, I\\'d like to know what atom and how large exactly. @Howard Malpas Particles don\\'t have spin... it is, Spin that has particles. An electron is not a solid, therefore the term spin is meaningless , the term spin as you call depends on the charge in the cloud or electon which is a wave function, therefore by measuring it changes its property or spin as you call it. Looking Glass Universe Email DraftScience - ds@draftphysics.com for a debate? He has over 6 years of science videos... Here\\'s his response to this video... https://youtu.be/9sHErolLX_s explaining Spin. Happy 2 year ago Birthday üòÄ. i love your voice, forget spin... I would say \\'charge\\' is like the momentum in a rolled up extra dimension! With lots of rolled up dimensions you get lots of types of charges.\\n\\nSpin is a weird thing! Really there are two kinds of electrons. Left-handed and right-handed. Kind of like how photons come in two polarisations. your voice sound like my English teacher\\'s :) Yay a video that actually attempts to explain spin! I\\'ve heard so many professors talk about it on youtube but the only explanation they ever give is that its a property of a particle. I realized they weren\\'t actually spinning around, but...\\n\\nNow I at least have some basic understanding of what spin... well not what it IS, but what it DOES I guess. Thank you! I understood the spin when my head spun while watching this video. 7:38 Haha this talks to me so much :D\\nYour explanations were outstanding in this video but the visual comic spin you gave it was better than ever also. I‚Äôm going to have to try again later. I find quantum stuff works best in small doses I\\'m lucky I watched this video! if not i would have misled by any \"I know all sources\". Thanks! This is the coolest and clear explanation os spin I\\'ve found so far! charge and energy were also my questions, i am so glade to  know some one in the physics world shares the same, looks like spin is going to be added to the list now. Thank you so much, nice videos keep up the good work you sound like you\\'re having a great time. I like that QFT makes many of those things logical and obvious. Like how the electron in really an excitation in a field. And how ist wavefunction can actually be larger than an atom. I research mri. \\nAll I know is we work with proton spins. In a strong mag field, a small part of them points antiparallel to the field. Never understood why. \\nShould all of them be pointed parallel, don\\'t? i think i am in love with your voice..  :) thank you for messing with the SPIN.. WOw. My head is spinning. Or rather it actually feels like it has a direction now! Ha. \\nI know so little of Physics, but it is one of my favourite hobbies (learning it). \\nThis was the best video I have ever seen, mostly because it really points out the problems of how we try to understand something that behaves in a way we really can\\'t quite agree on, or rather agree on explaining. Thank you soooo much :) 0:45 i was about say that we were kind of told electron spinning hence magnetism like moving charge,,, but i saw one another video before yours, found something else... i know what we were told was wrong... no way complaining about your video I just discovered your channel. I\\'m gladly subscibing! keep doing great stuff Thank you. This is very useful. I love how you leave an open question at the end. It makes me want to discover more. um waow, you have the loveliest voice :> OMG!!! those questions in the description made my head spin a lot faster than any spinning subatomic partical that iam aware ofüòµüòµüòµ I loved your depiction of this eerie phenomenon. I just got the hunch it (the spin \\'behaviour\\') might be the key to <how> we do not understand magnetism (rather than to how we could imagine an electron). Hope this triggers some. Thank you very much :o I\\'m writing a thesis on magnetic phenomens like superparamagnetism and I have to explain spin to college student :S. You really helped me with that video I was gonna write those blabla things in my thesis. I\\'ve just discovered this channel and it looks great :) Keep it up ! Hope u\\'ll read this message ',\n",

I was more impressed with the choir than some of the fashion by LV. It\\'s takes skill to appreciate true art I\\'VE SUNG FOR THAT SHOW! SO GRATEFUL TO NICOLAS GHESQUI√àRE, WOODKID, BRYCE DESSNER, MILENA CANONERO, CATHERINE SIMONPIETRI AND ALL FRIENDS FOR THE RIDE! Wow! That whole show must have required so much rehearsal! Music please thank u for the great show Louis Vuitton should stick to designing luggage and purses. Most of the clothes in this show are ugly or unwearable. Looks like those background people are from gucci collection and they are next to show after this louis vuittonüòÅ Spot on üòÑ Yes, and I was sooo looking forward to see their much more fun interesting outfits! They are mannequins Exactly Looooooooooool I\\'m such a sucker for historical fashion I was just waiting to see more details of the choir üò≠üò≠ I loved the dressed up choir, the singing and the music. \\n\\nWho they are and what was that piece of music? @Aladdine72  heyy can you suggest us  music for our fashion show The blue jeans at 6.36 is a scandle amongst so many beautiful things. @brenda haselden I don\\'t understand your answer. Free pornutube I love all.Haha~ OMG absolutely beautiful show @Th√©o Goldberg beautiful Thank you Alejandro I sung for it at the Louvre museum, unforgettable! Beautiful collection by Nicolas. He\\'s his best when he mixes period pieces with his idea of futuristic garments. He\\'s always pushing the industry forward. You must be joking.. Ru UK klm. ,&@Th√©o Goldberg cup drop GDP.. @Th√©o Goldbergh cry set      to @Th√©o Goldberg cb bio HTTPcup Fri cry cry-- Thank you Breathtaking. Nicolas Ghesquiere, you have done it again! Salute! You need to calm down For some reason I imagined Mr Bean falling on the spotlight in the middle of the show @ Anna Juli : The main choir is Sequenza 9.3 directed by Catherine Simonpietri, plus many choristers from other choirs and a few pro singers, plus many extras who weren\\'t singing. The music is \"Long lights\" by  Woodkid and Bryce Dessner, and it was composed for the event. Feels like I watched an opera. Sometimes it\\'s like the people in the back are the audiences and sometimes it\\'s like they\\'re performers. This is new and I like it. The perfect closing to Paris Fashion Week and to Fashion Month. I feel like I\\'m watching Les Miserables! I missed THIS Nicolas Ghesqui√®re who made me start to love fashion! My good old Ghesqui√®re! Amazing collection! 3:31 my favorite üî•üî•üíØ Only innovations are masterpieces. Ridiculous statement The model in 8:31 is in the movie, Love by Gaspar Noe. I had no idea this actress also modeled Real opera , stylish outfits, and organized event ... REAL ART Why is there no expression on their faces Woodkid just makes my heart flutter. He is a genius when it comes to music and vision. Love him One word: \"Exquisite\" This collection was absolutely exquisite!! Nicholas is a genius!! ‚ù§üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº The orchestras was phenomenal the ambulance Wow !!! Have to give it to the people who organized all of that... But the fashion I\\'m so sorry quiche this is something that has been done over and over... Where is the creativity and yet you charge your children\\'s hides if not their souls for this. And they knows what I mean by this....  \\nEither way it\\'s still very well done production. Louis Vuitton EVERYTHING is my favorite! In My Opinion The Choir Sounded So Good And The Collection Was Amazing As Well As The Models As Always I Am Still A Fan Of LV Work Of Art In Fashion Forever I Will Leave At That PEACE. such a creative idea of all the choir dressing as different era. iconic and impressive Is this years theme ugly and unwearable clothes for fashion? I loved the music but it makes it quite stressful. The clothes and music do not match. The mountain jackets are insaaaane üòç exactly how I would design them myself, looove Not exactly new. Definitely seen that look before. Creative and well done üëèüëèüëè looks like background are hosts from the past idea üòÇ 2:00 who is she? ü§©\\nEdit: Figured it out! Her name is Mika Schneiderüåü I wish I could collect all his collection since Callaghan to LV. ‚ù§Ô∏è him & his works. People who blurt out \"best show!\" Chances are they say that for every show. Me: wears plastic bag YES YES YES!!!!! innovative, modern, fun, clever, with interesting details, diverse, wearable.

A modern xv century . Bravo Nicolas !!! The music is beautiful! What‚Äôs the music starts at 6:35? Beautiful! Beautiful! Loved it Bess show!! üíØ Genius genius GENIUS! Watching the future fashioned Âè™ÊúâÊàëËßâÂæóÂêéÈù¢‰∏ÄÁæ§‰∫∫ÁöÑÁùÄË£ÖÊõ¥Â•ΩÁúãÔºü Magnificently crafted! I\\'m I the first to notice that the idea to have a chorus in the background dressed in historical costumes is not original?\\n None of the reviews seem to notice so I\\'m just going to assume this is really a fluke and copying something already done at the Metropolitan Opera over 10 years ago was an accident.\\nI literally just noticed a few hours ago when the Met made available the performance for free but the 2007 Mark Morris production of Orfeo ed Euridice (with costumes by Isacc Mizrahi) uses the chorus of that opera in quite a similar way to the one shown in this fashion show.\\n\\nIf this, however, wasn\\'t a fluke I find the fact that a show using music from a forgotten composer that lived centuries ago decided it was OK to ignore a more recent famous production as laughable as the silhouettes on parade in this show! Tremendous show and the mise en scene ..... sublime Bravo Wow Kris DeGirolamo at 6:23 such otherworldly androgynous beauty beyond comparison... Absolutely breathtaking. A brilliant collection and presentation. Thank you. Name of second to last model? Those clothes are so Beautiful i think some of the jackets look rlly cheap I am not even women and I could wear many of these pieces I wasn\\'t impressed. i didnt see the cohesion in the collection.

       " 'Canadian here, a parka is your heavy warm winter jacket (usually one including a hood with some fur around the edge) As a German, personally I associate \"Parka\" with an olive, military (style) jacket, as it was politically worn in the 60s or 80s, not made of synthetics, but cotton.\\nOfficially in our shops, every long jacket, winter jacket or raincoat can be a parka. Many of us would call a long weatherproof jacket an \"Anorak\" though. Brit here, a parka is exactly what you said (heavier coat, with fur rim round good). He held up a mac (most peeps in UK would say the same) Yess that‚Äôs what we call it in Scotland UK here yeah a parka is a big winter jacket @amazingabby25 left coast hehehe I feel like this has been causing Tan a lottttt of inner rage Tbh it has been for me lmaooo, even tho he did have a few of these wrong LOL he got so defensive after vest. What is called a cami in England, the American school system likes to call \"breaking our sexist dress code\". @laceyluzano INSPIRING STUFF Yesss! I\\'m a teacher, and I completely agree! I didn\\'t learn till I was an adult that we send the message to girls that it is their fault if boys are distracted. It also tells boys that if a girl is wearing certain clothes, she is asking for attention. We need to undo this! Until then, I refuse to enforce dress code rules that unfairly target girls. There are also rules that target Black students. We need to get rid of those, too. @Esme 404 You mean sixth grade? I dunno what your tryying to say aha In England schools, everyone has to wear a school uniform, except sixth form @Garret Van Wie Why thank you He didn\\'t say anything about trainers vs. sneakers. In England it is most definitely trainers and nothing else, in England @Granger Things we call jogging bottams joggers, well some people do in uk runners in canada californiahummus i call then shoes I live in Michigan and have never, ever said sneakers. Growing up, we called them tennis or gym shoes.  As an adult, I now say running shoes, because there are so many sport-specific shoes . We Brits call them Charity Shops usually - much more commonly used phrase than \"Second Hand Shops\".......and it\\'s \"a pair of trousers\" not \"a trouser\". Just like we say \"a pair of pants\",  and not \"a pant\". I think only the occasional fashion designers here says \"pant\" lol Scotland is the same charity shop not second hand shop I think he was referring more to the fabric? I‚Äôve heard a lot of fashion people refer to plural clothing as singular when referring to the cut or fabric @homie93 in the fashion industry, \"a pant\" or \"a trouser\" are commonly used. You will hear almost every designer or stylist say this. Its not a commons people term so thats why a lot of people are confused by it well in America we rarely say \"a pant\" but it isn\\'t incorrect. Im sure its the same in England. meanwhile in germany: rain shield, hand shoes, wind coat, etc hand shoes????? In Dutch we also call gloves \\'hand shoes\\'. (Handschoenen) @Caeilia Windjacke gibts wirklich aber Regenjacke ist nat√ºrlich h√§ufiger und auch windabweisend. HAND SHOES LOOOOOOL Lili ayyy yess German the only language to be more literal than America üòÇ this should be renamed: Tan France hating English clothing terms for 8 minutes He british but love america more English clothes terms are way better in my term, but that is probably because i am british, and i have only ever seen the american terms on cringe americans movies so whenever anyone says that, like sneakers in an american accent, it is just.... .. like if anyone ever said sneakers in england, they would put on an american accent, really exaggerated one, and say it to make people laugh. Bt im pretty sure other countries mock our accent too Here we are, in our pyjamas, on lockdown, learning how to pair our blazers with mini skirts and sneakers Cristina N. That‚Äôs what I gathered lol Tan with American terms: Makes sense.\\nTan with Brit terms: What was the reason?! A lot of the terms are Cockney, are they not? @Esme 404 It\\'s not boring to be a part of Harry Potter bro @Lucy Vue exactly, brit terms make sense. I mean cloakroom vs coatcheck. Yay coat check? BORING! Cloak room sounds like we are all harry potter wizards Marie G The reason? It‚Äôs more fun! LOL It‚Äôs not called a brolly in the UK, brolly is just short for umbrella @Lizzie x7 yes Sanguine Vastaya - we always call it a brolly ‚òîÔ∏èüá¨üáß @Elinor Vickers I remember that term - a gamp is always big and black. Its origin is a Dickens character. So pedantic lol In Newcastle it is called a gamp, or used to be. I feel like any Brit I know would have completely disregarded american terms and just said the UK is always better that‚Äôs what we do Lol America is overrated @Maya Seligman yes, he be a traitor Us Brits are very patriotic to people outside the UK, but not to people who are also British Ikr I feel like this is tan just betraying the uk big timeüòÇ Thomas Evans as an Indian I agree as well üá¨üáß > üá∫üá∏ He has no idea.... A parka is a padded winter jacket with a (fur trimmed) hood in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and most places in the world ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ Why is this guy standing in Janet\\'s void lol ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ @I Like Cats But I\\'m Allergic To Them it\\'s concluded When is that show coming back? ü•∫ Gen Wilson me too üò¢ I miss that show ü•∫ Im not gonna watch this video but I lived in England and I never once heard them say anything other than \"charity shop\" for a thrift store. That\\'s very true, but I think part of it is because most of our second hand shops are charity shops, however not all are. If they\\'re run by a charity then they\\'re a charity shop, if they\\'re just selling second stuff then they\\'re not Exactly!! Vintage shop in London, is exactly the same thing in the US As someone that lived there for half a year recently (and now I\\'m preparing for a long term visa there) you are correct. Thrift stores are the equivalent to charity shops. Someone in another section of the comments said that \"second hand store\" is supposed to be for used items but a step up in quality. Haha and he talks about vintage stores as though we don\\'t have them ourselves. I suppose he just wasn\\'t the type to go thrifting when he was in England. So many of these British ones are not accurate for 90% of the population üòÇ painnn Uh Tan, even as a fellow Yorkshire lad I have to disagree with you on some of these. You\\'ve spent too much time across the pond! @Peter Masefield defo Whole-heartedly agree with statement. Wellies is short for Wellington boots which were popularised by the Duke of Wellington. Wellies Glamour: Tan breaks down American/British fashion terms\\nScottish people:\\nIrish people:\\nWelsh people:\\n\\nTan: sO thAt\\'S wHaT wE sAy in EnGlaND Well if it makes you feel better, we hear British as English. We consider Scotland, Ireland, and Wales as their own separate places and cultures. @Dani Ayala so why is the video titles british and not english? I think about this sort of thing all the time. They want us to stay? Except we don‚Äôt say it in england either üòÇ \\u200b@S L Your occasional confusion is perfectly understandable but frankly for Tan himself (born in Yorkshire - England) to get this wrong is pretty insulting.  England is no more important or senior than Scotland, Wales or N. Ireland and although it\\'s been a common sloppy habit in the past (that only the English ever make by the way), in this day and age it should not be used to describe the whole country especially when the Union Jack is used as the symbolic flag here. \\nI\\'m English by the way but feel just as aggrieved as any Scot etc. because I\\'m also British. As a British person living in the UK I can confirm that where I live we call trenches trenches and the jacket he said was a parka is actually what we call a Mac and a parka is a heavy winter coat, usually with a fur trimmed collar! @Anya Wilkinson second hand shop just makes me think of a second hand car shop. So we have second hand car shops, and charity shops for everything else like clothes and kids toys etc. Definitely!! Also, second hand shop? Yeah some people say that, but I hear charity shop a lot more. And we definitely say umbrella as well as brolly ü§£ Different people call it different things, I call it a trench coat keeva_d thank youuu I don\\'t know where you got the British versions but I have never heard anyone call a raincoat , a raincheater and I\\'ve lived here my entire life He never said raincheater I‚Äôm in the South-East of England too. In the 70‚Äôs we had Windcheaters. You can‚Äôt be that old.  Just a spring chicken @amelia yeah, maybe it\\'s outdated because my parents use arachaic terms. Nice to see a fellow south-englander on YouTube though : ) @Affadoodle Tigress Joint Account oh I\\'m south east and never heard it, thought it could have  been like some scottish, welsh or other country kinda saying America: sweater\\nEngland: jumper\\nGermany: pullover I was about to say jumper made the most sense, but it doesn\\'t, pullover does. But jumper sounds the best. I mean, you pull a *jumper etc* over your head, so thats probs why. But that is so boring, are you gonna call socks \"pull on\" now? Lol\\nJumper sounds cool, but that is just because i grew up using that term All 4 in England. Just depends on where you are and who you ask. Some terms are more common to different regions. honestly pullover makes the most sense @Lindy Clarke in Spain too Anna M the netherlands: TRUI Hmmm. as a Brit, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever said windbreaker/ windcheater - looks like a cagoule to me He is just trying to be smart by knowing the proper name for things a cagoule? No, a cagoule is longer and drapes Also who calls trench coats trench? @DXRKE in my experience cagoule is any super light weight waterproof which you can throw easily over many layers and pack away tightly. Yep, that was definitely a cagoule Tan really said vintage shop instead of charity shop, my inner british heart crying üò¢ He hate British I hate when these influencers say ‚ÄúBlazer is so huge right now‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt blazer a timeless item which is always ‚Äúhuge‚Äù? üôÑ @A Floating Pineapple yup Just school uniform init American terms are very straight forward meanwhile British terms are more unique and creative. I prefer UK terms I prefer british terms too @JW McCabe erm no, they are creative and interesting. Cloakroom vs coatcheck. Obviously cloakroom is a lil bit more interesting, just one example No, British terms are more uniform\\nand non descriptor Why does one country get to say what is ‚Äúcorrect?‚Äù That‚Äôs absurd. I don‚Äôt tell French Canadians that their entire language is wrong. It is simply different. @extramedium1 wtf, not saying this to start an argument but did you seriously just say the typical arrogance of a BRIT not an american!? Lol that\\'s funny, almost thought you were serious for a second, good joke hahhahahah @extramedium1 what are you on abiut Elizabeth Robinson Tan certainly is multicultural however, he shows the typical arrogance of a Brit. Americans revolted. We are not a typical colony of your empire. American English is correct in its own right. It\\'s not because he\\'s British. It\\'s because he spent half his life in America and half his life in Britain and his ENTIRE life in the clothing/fashion industry I would hardly call Tan France \"one country,\" but okay üëå I dunno if this is just regional differences but, Tan, so many of those were wrong?? \\n\\n\\nThat trenchcoat is called a trenchcoat in the UK, a mac is a completely different material. It has a hood and (usually) a zip, and the classic \\'mac\\' is the yellow one Georgie wears in IT.\\nI guess the parker is technically right but I\\'d call that an anorak, because parkers are the ones with a fur-lined hood, and they\\'re usually lined on the inside as well. Parkers be thicc!\\nHe\\'s right about vintage store vs second hand stores, but second hand stores are called charity shops because the only shops where people can donate their clothes are owned by charities. Nobody calls it a second hand store.\\nTrousers are plural Tan! But so are pants, so I\\'ll let you off on that one...\\nBrolly is just short for umbrella, we know that\\'s what its name is. TAN: You guys are usually right in the US.. \\nME (a brit): Tan you traitor!!!\\n\\n\\n(Jokes, obviously love ya tan xx) I caught sarcasm in that comment, because you can never tell an American anything different that what they \\'know\\' in their world. ;) (Canadian here) TRAITOR! British terms are da best It‚Äôs called a sweater because it‚Äôs thick wool and makes you sweat...here in Canada a jumper is a sleeveless dress that you wear over a shirt, it‚Äôs more like something a toddler would wear. \"And makes you sweat\" \\nNot gonna lie, that is a bit gross that you named your version of a jumper after sweat, im never gonna look t someone saying sweater the sme way again lol @Katie Chambers Playsuits in the Uk is like a jumpsuit, but shorts on the bottom half instead of longer legs. The dress would be called a pinafore or dungaree dress. In Australia we called sweaters jumpers, whoa really? I\\'ve never heard that term before. Is it a region specific term (I live in eastern Ontario) or have I just been living under a rock lol. @Autmn Leaf Yes...though the use of \\'jumper\\' for girls pinafore dresses is probably decreasing due to the internet and increased global communication. \"A\" trouser? A pant? Seriously? I thought they come in pairs üòÑ Slacks , Jean\\'s, = pants short for pantaloons I had a typical American abroad moment when in London last year. I‚Äôll never forget the awkward look on the employee‚Äôs face at M&S when I told him I was looking to buy a few pairs of pants for my dad since he hadn‚Äôt bought any nice ones in a while üòÇ Yeah, well pants is underwear. I honestly don\\'t get it how americans decided pants was a good one to use Didn\\'t realise he stanned America so much, letting us down Ikr, i think the english terms make way more sense. Strange that playsuit/romper and sneakers/trainers weren‚Äôt included but diaper/nappy was??? Hmm I was waiting for the sneakers lol Is anyone else just watching youtube allll day while quarantined???\\n\\nAlso do any small youtubers want to be friends and support each other? ü•∞ absolutely Subscribe to sgfamilyfuntime JLe Vlogs me JLe Vlogs me I\\'m triggered by the fact that he literally said \"a trouser\" and I\\'m not even a native speaker. It sorta bothers me, when he says it\\'s \"universal\", as if the UK and the US are the whole universe @cincysbest But really, just because in your case it is not like that, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not like that at all. I had a friend who has been asked if we have roads in Europe . I am not accusing anybody in particular, but a lot of times people do think that other countries in the world are just less developed than the USA to a degree where they think we still live in the middle ages. But even just your use of the words \"you foreigners\" proves my point in a way. I am not saying all Americans are like that, but a lot of them are. @Ulaa YT No you people are just sensitive asf and just looking to be triggered. You do the same thing that you accused us in America of doing.  This particular video ISN\\'T about you . @Rainbow Ice cream You really don\\'t though lol. At least not in America you don\\'t. You foreigners are so sensitive it\\'s funny. @Aya Elizabeth I know what he meant I\\'m just saying he used the wrong word to describe it.... its because the two main types of english are british and american. so when he says universal he means in the english speaking world if that makes sense. hes not disregarding the rest of the world, hea just giving the universal english name as its called both in the two english‚Äôes‚Äô He has so little idea what he‚Äôs taking about that it‚Äôs painful to watch this. Made it to 3:40 and gave up. Bad call, algorithm. He seems rubbish at the ‚ÄòBritish‚Äô version of words.... and he was interchanging British, English and U.K. which are not all the same .... a disaster @Yigyigs Ohh ok its like kinda like calling usa the americas. But thank you it helped :)) aiemii i Britain is the name of the physical island mass, which contains the countries Scotland, England and Wales. Whereas the United Kingdom is given to the political union between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \\n\\nHowever, the problem with interchanging these terms  is that they‚Äôre clearly not all the same regions. And with all differences in regions, comes difference in culture and language. He should‚Äôve just said England!\\n\\nHope this helps :) What\\'s the difference of Britan vs Uk brolly= short for umbrella\\nwellies= short for wellingtons In Aus we call second-hand/thrift shops op shops. It\\'s short for opportunity shop. \\n\\nWe call them vintage stores if older pieces are curated together too. seeing the thumbnail: ITS A CHARITY SHOP The fact that that Burberry famously made the trench coat for British soldiers in ww1 and as a Brit I‚Äôve never heard it referred to as a Mac In the US we also call that a SHIRT. doctor: ‚Äúyou have 7 minutes and 54 seconds left to live‚Äù\\n\\n\\nme: My English teacher in 3rd grade: repeatedly screams: It\\'s always trouserS, just like glasses, you use the plural!!!1!!!1 I know in German we say \"eine Hose\" but they use the plural because it has two legs!!! (loosing his mind because 20 nine y/o just couldn\\'t grasp the concept) \\nTan France: A trouser, a pant ü§∑üèª\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è N. American English=pants.  UK English=trousers.  Fancy fashion speak=a pant, a trouser. I believe it is called a sweater as it became part of fashion when people started to exercise for fitness, wearing a long sleeved heavy a top that you would sweat in. That is a bit weird that you named a jumper after sweat. You could say that brits named jumper after exercise cos jumping is exercise, so i will say that for the purpose of this. Would you rather wear something named after jumping related to exercise, or sweating related to exercise. If you say sweater i will be a bit......\\nBut that\\'s cool lol, don\\'t want to start an argument about jumpers or sweaters lol In aus üá¶üá∫\\nRain boots / wellies = gum boots\\nCami/vest top / tank top = singlet\\nThrift store = op shop (opportunity shop)\\nPants/underpants = knickers/ underwear At least you don\\'t call trousers pants lol, what were Americans thinking Renee Noonan or undies Me being Australian and confused for 5 minutes When the captions say ‚Äú hello gramma  I am 10 France‚Äù the most obvious one is sneakers VS shoes.\\nAlso, a parka is a heavy coat with a faux fur/shearling lined hood, not that thin little jacket lol. You mean sneakers vs trainers?\\nShoes is the general term for all footwear Basically the reason why you guys have words that ‚Äúmake more sense‚Äù is because with the English language it has been developed for centuries, words mixed with Latin, French, old English (which is actually very different) so that‚Äôs why it just doesn‚Äôt sound right however America decided to change their English to be more simple so things like tyre became tire, colour- color, jumper-sweater, (I‚Äôm assuming pants is an abbreviation of the French word for trousers- pantalon). As an Australian, I am getting so confused with some of the terms that both America and England uses lol @ToriJaneIsAmazing lol @ToriJaneIsAmazing your not wrong there haha England and America: \\'proper\\' words for things\\nKiwis and Aussies: lets just shorten everything American here (Ohio/Midwest)\\nI always just thought a sweater was called that cause it makes you sweat. Lol When I call my sweaters jumper it makes me feel fancy af. üòÇ Esme 404 thats funny. I guess some people would. ü§î i cant help but sometimes say things in a very Oliver twist vibe lol If we say sweater or sneaker in England, it is only when we are doing that thing where we pit on an exaggerated american accent and say sweater and people laugh. But don\\'t foreigners do that about the english accent @Saint Artemis this made me chuckle Sapphire Blossom lol well yeah, if all your life you called it a sweater and then you switch it up to jumper people around you like friends and family would be like ‚Äúwhat are you talking about.‚Äù Idk thats just me. ü§∑üèΩ\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è Haha that\\'s crazy. Jumper is fancy?? üòÇ i thought he said hello grandma in the beginning I\\'m British and I\\'ve never heard most of the British terms üòÇ i thought thrift stores were called charity shops in england\\nthey‚Äôre called charity shops for me where i live-\\n\\n*just me? mk bye* Nope, everyone in england says charity shop i love how his accents gets more aggressive as the video goes on I love Tan he always tries to say his point of view in a calm way until he can‚Äôt handle it anymore, i noticed on the vest üòÇ That\\'s not a mac, a mac is a waterproof coat @Cutequeen oh ok lol @water pop tarts My Grandma says mac sometimes, but we mostly say waterproof, short for waterproof coat,\\n\\nalso a mac computer is short for Macintosh which is named after a waterproof coat called a Macintosh A Mac is a computer\\nAlso do people rlly say Mac I\\'ve never heard anyone say that before... i feel like you got really technical with some of the pants and shirts. also \"a pant\" lol I‚Äôm British, and the British version seems pretty inaccurate... üòÖ It‚Äôs a sweater because you sweat in them XD. Gross, well enjoy your nice jumpers, the sweaty version i mean\\n(Also, just saying i mean this comment as a joke, no offence intended) Love Tan, he is so wholesome! WHO ELSE HAS WATCHED *NEXT IN FASHION* ON NETFLIX?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust me? Ok... The Secret Doodler - Nope, I watched it & enjoyed it except I thought they did too many team challenges. To be clear, wellies are a staple in the UK and short for \\'Wellington boots\\' and I\\'ve never heard of goloshes All those brits are gonna freeze to death if that\\'s the \"parka\" they bring to Canada in the winter LOL Te amo,‚ù§Ô∏è eres lindo para explicar y hoy aprend√≠ algo nuevo, cu√≠date tuüòä also in England we say umbrella it\\'s just brolly is short for umbrella this video is so faulse us brits dont talk like that!!! Love you but The uk isn‚Äôt just England Tan! Scotland, Wales & northern Ireland ü•∞ I\\'ve lived in England for over 5 years and have never once heard an umbrella being called a \"brolly\" What a cute human he is! I love his light energy and his humour üòç‚ù§Ô∏è Is it me or this kind of stuff is recommended for me during quarantine Okay but why did he say the trench coat was called a Mack. A Mack (short for mackintosh) is a waterproof coat, preferably yellow. Something tells me there were Americans behind the cameraüòÇ Yes but WHY is a trench called a trench? If it is military inspired is \"trench\" referencing the trenches? Yes.  The design was used by British and French soldiers during WWI, which was mainly fought in trenches, so \"trench coat.\"  Some design elements that are still popular today were developed exclusively for military purposes, for example button-down shoulder tabs, which were used to hold things like gas masks, gloves, or epaulettes (shoulder pieces that demonstrate military rank). And in Australia we use all these words completely interchangeably. I have his autobio!! it‚Äôs so good, i totally recommend it ‚ù§Ô∏è\\n(Naturally Tan üòâ) Starting to question if I‚Äôm actually British *17 yo french girl* WHO WAS GOING TO TELL ME THAT SHIRT AND BUTTON UP ARE TWO WORDS FOR THE SAME THING I WAS SO CONFUSED FOR SO MANY YEARS I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS.\\nThe vest part is the highlight of this video\\nps. i live in Britain and we do use \"mac\" \"galoshes\" and second hand shops No, it is charity shop I thought a snood is like a decorative hair net/ covering Archergrl5 - my dad used to be a Civil War re-enactor when I was a kid & I used to go with.  Had the fill outfit including a snood for my hair.  Mine had a pretty bow & clipped in with a barrette so I could just put my hair in a ponytail & then stuff it in the hairnet & clip the barrette above the rubber band. Charity shops is what I‚Äôve heard them referred to in London. ‚ÄúI know that you call them tighty whities‚Äù üò≠üò≠uhh no I don‚Äôt I don\\'t think he was correct every time... \\nI LOVE his shirt, tho... Fancy shirt lol I\\'ve heard second hand shop before. Charity shop\\nCloak room\\nBam. Ive always called it a charity shop Yeah.. Yes and when I  was a kid we called the place to put our coats the coat closet. i\\'ve NEVER used the word parka lol, and i\\'m english Same, all those words, just mean coat to me. Just different types of coats Tan is adorable üòç Love how he just gets increasingly defensive about the British words throughout the video üòÇ ah. I just love Tan. America: sweater\\nBritain: jumper\\nSouth Africa: jersey It\\'s called a \"sweater\" because people used to wear it to make them sweat while working out, which they thought would help them lose even more weight. Obviously much logical than jumper! In Australia this woolen type is called a jumper, and the sweat pants fabric type a sloppy joe. @Boh ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£dude Although if you think about it jumping is also related to working out Why in the world am I watching this ? how does his hair look so good i mean keep your hair nice and healthy but like its gorgeous. its sad bc im not even talking about the video Actually, tighty-whities in U.S. are referred to as briefs. However, I do like the term Y-fronts. This video should\\'ve been referenced in the \"Next in Fashion\" Netflix show. I have never said button up in my life. Huh. I love you Tan.

Thank you so much and I wish everyone who is reading this has many blessingsüíï. Hi Justine,\\nI am in a moment in my life that I have to make important decisions about my career. I am not thaaaat young (33 yy) and I am already architect and urban designer. However I have never worked in my field of study (have been working as children\\'s teacher) because I couldn\\'t find a job. At the same time, I never really felt like really pushing myself to work with architecture and urban design. Recently I started to try different things that I always have been interested (painting, photography, cinema, fashion) in short courses, and by far when I did the short fashion course was the thing that I liked most and felt very inspired and connected. Meanwhile I was admitted to a master program in Sustainable Urban Design (which is something that I believe is very important for the future of the world, ett ett) but I can\\'t forget this will of studying and changing my career towards fashion design. I simply don\\'t know what to do, because if I decide to study fashion I will spend all my savings (I was researching schools and I was pretty satisfied with ESMOD, in Franca, but still not sure). I am really confused, I am just saying a lot of personal stuff for someone that I don\\'t even know hahhaah but I am feeling really lost :( i love your videos they\\'re very helpful thank you <3 It`s been a while since I was here. \\nJustine I wish to know if you know anything about the fashion school of design in Sweden named \"Beckmans\" design school? \\nDo you think its a good  school to go to? I think I can¬¥t afford Parsons or Saint Martins. And by the way.. Thank you so much for beeing generous and share some important knowledge of the Fashion industry. And right now youre my teacher. Thank you so much.

I\\'ve studied fashion designing complete 15 years back n after marriage whole knowledge went in vain... Now, due to some of the bad circumstances of my life I need to start my carrier in this line... Ur tutorials r very helpful but I don\\'t know where to go how shud I start my carrier in this line...plz guide me which books n tutorials can help me to start my carrier... Thanks are they questioning the school were you studied? Just study patterns. They\\'re very instructive. Start with the simple patterns and progress. Mix and match collars, sleeves, hemlines, etc. Sell in a few local stores and progress to larger stores. It doesn\\'t need to be complicated. really nice video \\nhi  Justine,  i have love for fashion design and love for textile making but am thinking of going to an institution to get better experience, d problem i have now is the schools here in Sweden  is said to feature on one but not both  so that means i rather study fashion or textile in different occasion and i don t know which to pick cos i have love for both. kindly advice me pls.\\nthanks  and best regards. +Justine Leconte officiel hmmmm... thanks a lot Justine I do understand all what u said and it make good sense to me i do apreciate. +mercy onyeukwu Hi! Difficult question indeed... Here is my personal opinion (others might disagree): I believe that fashion design gives a more global view & working on the entire process makes you become better creatively. And then you can take a few textile design classes on top, on the side.\\nIf you go directly into textile design, on the other hand, you might not know what textiles are used for or how the body works - there are fabrics that don\\'t work as soon as you try to drape them on a mannequin & then I always wonder what the point of such fabrics is...\\nSo to summarize, I would say that it is better to learn the entire process first (fashion) & then specialise into one area (textile, patternmaking...) at a later stage.  Fashion design also makes your profile more \"holistic\" so you would have more areas of the industry where you could get a job.\\nNow having said all that: if you think you still want to do textile, then go for it, be really good at it & you will have just as much fun! :-) Hello Justine! thank you for all these inspiring videos! \\nI would like to ask you if know some other way to take fashion design lessons,  meaning apart full time fashion school.\\nI have 2 reasons that i cannot attend a typical fashion: I dont have much spare time due to my day jod and i cannot afford at this period of my life to pay for a fashion school.\\nSo I was wondering, if there is some kind of open learning,distance learning, online courses/seminars etc. that i could attend?\\nThank you in advance for your time! +Katerina You should be able to find regular drawing classes in Athens where you learn how to draw people, then just adapt what you learn by making the proportions \"fashionable\" & by drawing poses. Since you are already in design and probably have a good eye, it will be easier for you  üòâ @Justine Leconte officiel Thank you Justine.\\nI live in Athens, in Greece and my bachelor studies were in the design field in general (product,industrial, interior and so on..) but always wanted to get involved into fashion...\\nSo anyway,..I am actually taking pattern making lessons, I am already in the 2nd year but I am searching also some kind of way to learn how to draw fashion sketches professionally, and why not even get some kind of certification on that...\\nThank you though for your time! +Katerina hi, I don\\'t know in which country & city you live but you could try to find sewing and pattern-making classes in your city, on evenings / week-ends. Technique classes are better taken \"live\", not online (in my opinion). Then you can learn fashion history by reading textbooks. Some universities (usually in larger cities) also offer evening classes for working people. As for real online courses, you need to google in your country, in the language you would prefer. It is very country-specific... I hope it helps! +Katerina hi, I don\\'t know in which country & city you live but you could try to find sewing and pattern-making classes in your city, on evenings / week-ends.

Before I went to AAU I read a lot of bad reviews online but don\\'t believe it because I saw it first hand...those people gave up easily and didn\\'t take AAU seriously. Have you been to any of the fashion show? I think there is one in May...you should go and see for yourself.\\nGladys Palmer works there too, she\\'s one of the best fashion illustrator in the industry and also Simon Ungless (sorry if I mispelled his name lol) I heard he is Alexander Mc Queen\\'s friend and they went to school together. hey it\\'s really good to see your video..it\\'s really to the point. can u suggest book to refer and study at home.

Wt should we study to become a fashion designer the video proved to be very helpful...thank you so much...\\ncan you please suggest good youtubers with sewing tutorials for beginners , üòï Hey, so i have a quick question. I am currently 16 and am planning on studying to become a fashion designer. The only thing is, i don\\'t know how to sew, and i don\\'t even have a sewing machine... Is it crucial to be able to sew, or can i design my garments, choose fabrics, cut out the fabrics, and then pay someone else to sew them??? Are there people who do that sort of thing? Same same Same I\\'m literally in the same situation,I\\'m the same age as you and I found out,especially this year that I\\'m really into fashion and I want it to become a part of my everyday routine but I have so much to learn and I don\\'t know what to do,I just started sketching some croquis but that\\' nothing... Hello Justine \\nI love your videos . \\nYour videos have inspired me a lot\\nI too want to become a fashion designer but I am just studying in school so can you give me some more helpful tips???\\nIt will be a great help +Shubhi Srivastava I did a video on how to start your own line üòâ I‚Äôm in love with ur thoughts and the way u say hi it‚Äôs Justine üòò Hey justine, is every fashion designer must know how to use sewing machine?  Hope you\\'re gonna answer my questionüôÇ Justine Leconte officiel thanks because answering my questionüíï I\\'d say yes.. You don\\'t have to be the best sewer but you need to understand what is doable and what not, when you design a garment (and where it will need seams, etc.) Do you have to train as a sewer to be a designer? you need to understand what is doable and what is not, so a minimum level of skills in sewing is required - in my opinion. Salut! Juste une question...vu que je n\\'ai pas la possibilit√© de fr√©quenter une √©cole de mode, pourrais-tu me conseiller un bon libre √† propos de ce sujet? Merci! I have a question if i graduated from any another field except fashion designing n only learning online then  is there any scope to become  a fashion designer +Justine Leconte ya thanku so much n ur videos r really very help full thx üòäüòä +Pradnya sonar hi! Fashion design is applied art... so you need to apply what you learn in order to know (and really experience) what works, what doesn\\'t work, and how to find solutions when you have a problem with the construction of a garment. You need to try fabrics, try sewing techniques etc... Try to get practice to complete what you are learning online! Good luck! Your videos  are great :D but i have a few questions, so i think maybe you will make a video in which you tell more about Parsons and life in New York, for example: How much it costs study at Parsons? How expensive is life in New York? Something about flats in New York and how much it costs to maintain itself there? What with work in New York? How looks education at Parsons? Yess!! We want one from you Justine, your personal advice. +Unio Sa you will find all that information on the Parsons website. It also provides you with a budget calculation, have a look there üòâ I won\\'t becone designer and I have never think of it. I find your tips very helpfull for all the office pople who want to have creative mind and want to remember who they really are :) You are wonderfull üòò +Emilia J thanks! hiee Justin\\nthanku you for this valuable video. \\nin the last couple of years , I have developed a keen interest in designing and pattern making. out of mere passion and interest I\\'ve learnt a lot of things from tutorials such as yours , books, internet illustrations etc. I can sew and make garments. but I don\\'t have a educational degree in fashion iv graduated from another field. I want to b in the fashion industry. could I get a start by doing a diploma in fashion designing? plzz help. Jessel Pires even I have the same question. Do let me know if you find an answer üòü Moreover, I cannot afford this course. This is helpfully so that people know what they are in for. You are right about drawing. I am learning that drawing is crucial skills that extend beyond art. Learning to be creative is essential. Many people never think much of art or drawing but now that I am learning it I am having ideas and it applies to everything not just art. I think it tap into other areas of the brain. +athena energy Shine Definitely. The more ideas you get, the more new ideas they create. So in creativity, \"more is more\". That\\'s why practicing is key, it trains the brain to see the world differently... thank you for the video.\\ni watch all your videos from the \"begginers part 1...and so on.\\ni would be happy if you keep on uploading your videos,\\nand we watch it.

I\\'ve always been watching your videos, and I always loved them! I\\'ve made many of these creations. I honestly think your channel is so underrated. Do about cats please i love them Its kirigami because you‚Äôre cutting the paper lol That isn\\'t true. Sometimes you need to cut paper to make sure you have to right shape. If you\\'re doing that, which is this case, it\\'s still origami. This is basically cutting the paper in half not because it\\'s part of the project, just so you can separate the pieces of paper since they\\'re models of their own now.

       " 'Ellen is that good friend that makes sure their quiet friend is always involved in the conversation memeimfurst I wish I had a friend like that, I‚Äôm mostly the one that always takes cares of my friends and makes sure there also getting attention üôÇ Agreed, although it might not be about being good friend but good host. I mean this is television we\\'re talking about, there\\'s no really place for awkwardness so Ellen was in fact trying to involve Jen but the mistake I think was on the girl, she kind of completely ignored Jen so instead of being a great segment, it is good but kind of awkward. Sandy Simon bruh she‚Äôs Jennifer Aniston. Everyone loves her whether she‚Äôs talking or not True, although didn\\'t seem to me that Jennifer Aniston really could do much in this segment and best she was quiet rather than attempting to grab any spotlight with what may have been inane commentary on her part üòï. She probably shouldn\\'t have even been included in this piece in the first place ü§∑ Rightey! U noticed tht too, ey? She is very considerate of n sensitive twds her ppl arnd her. üòò I\\'m watching this..Just cause there\\'s Jennifer Aniston Same PARTH GANVIR me yoo Same Same Same I think that Ayesha could have paid a little more attention to Jennifer. She‚Äôs constantly facing her body towards Ellen and talking to Ellen. By the expressions on Jennifer‚Äôs face, Jennifer is probably pretty left out and feeling pretty awkward. Then again, Ayesha is trying to fit in many recipes into 5 minutes and may not be able to converse that much. However, I feel that it would have been a lot better if she could at least make some eye contact with Jennifer. And Ellen did a great job trying to be inclusive. That\\'s so true The faces Jen makes during this segment are great . @THE BOSS You need glasses, Jennifer was not rude at all Honestly Ayesha didn‚Äôt talk to Jen or direct the convo to her . She barely looks at her .Also she doesn‚Äôt just stand in the middle she‚Äôs literally just right on top of Ellen . Ellen is the one that tries to include Jen . passive aggressiveness is not great i found it tacky It was kinda a strange. Not sure if she felt awkward, throwing shade, trying to be funny, or... I don‚Äôt even like cooking shows, but I love watching Jennifer Aniston‚Äôs reactions SO MUCH. Sarah M. Ik me to üòÇ Sarah M. Me tooüòÇüòÇ Jenn is like me when my friend invites her friend who i dont know and starts being awkward. Girrrrl, me too.  Me too.  Hashtag, me too. she should\\'ve at least pay a little attention to beautiful Jenni..she always look only to Ellen as if they are only two people there. good thing Ellen is a good host that she always include Jen. Good friend* Its soo awkward how shes only acknowledging ellen, you can tell ellen was trying to get jenn involved.. Jayy Abhdjdjdjd surely :) Cooking/food segments in talk shows are always so awkward cause theyre always rushing to fit everything in It must be hard to both talk and prepare the meal.

Same @NYCzora Bruce almighty, we are the Millers , horrible bosses are regarded as some of the funniest movies of this century. How is that forgetful ? @Jill Dewit He has 2 likes on his comment and I have 99. @NYCzora Really? Forgettable? Funny I still remember every movie she\\'s been in. Her movies are still popular. Eric Cartman She\\'s not a legend. She\\'s a mediocre actress who was in a popular TV show and a bunch of forgettable movies I think she would appreciate it if they keep it about her and not mention her husband Everytime she does a show or something on TV . William Murnan She never said that. William Murnan she never said that. It is scary how the internet can put words in someones mouth I think she could live with it. She even mentioned her brother in law who was in the picture which was flashed. That‚Äôs what marriage does anyways. @alma martinez  not really she has social media her own cookbook show and a deal with CoverGirl she would still be known she is under the radar for many people because they overlook her for her husband but she is successful by her self and known The only reason she\\'s famous is because of who her husband is... Look at JENs expressions üòÇüòú\\n\\n‚ÄúTypical Rachael Green ..

If I was Ayesha I would be \"Oh my god !! I would freak out !! It\\'s Jenn Aniston. HAHAHA. Jen\\'s face when Ayesha says \"equal parts sugar and water\". Let me  boil some water and give my whole attention to Jenifer Aniston . Felt kinda awkward at times Felt it. Ayesha kept ignoring Jennifer (unintentionally probably), that could be it. ELLEN kept trying to include Jennifer :-) I just think Ayesha was a little nervous. Please don\\'t touch my nose! Jennifer acting interested when this whole thing is so uncomfortable for some reason. Omg... Ayesha\\'s voice reminds me of Mila Kunis\\' voice!!!!! OMG YESS!!! Now that you said it... yeah it does. Ellie Iredale Ikr if she was in Family Guy no one would know the difference yes, she reminds me of Mila but without accent. Ellie Iredale so true ! *Not Jen\\'s greatest acting moment.* üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Ayesha needs to acknowledge Jennifer. Throughout the whole segment Jennifer is being so cute and trying to get involved and Ayesha right here is making no eye contact! Rude! ayeshas overrated anyways Red Stilletto Shut up @Where the light_Ends exactly!! Um no she doesn\\'t. This isn\\'t the Jennifer Aniston show. This is the Ellen show. Her attention was directed correctly. Ellen was dlingnyhr eight thing by including her in the conversation. Ayesha was there to cook. Give her a break! She definitely acknowledged Jennifer a couple times in this 5 min clip. Jennifer barely said anything at all. The most we got was the \"Woooow\"! When adding the cheese to the guac... I‚Äôm mexican and I just watched my culture been crushed with that guacamole i feel so sorry for jen but ellen is so good at involving herüíû Anyone else think Jen seemed annoyed in this segment? mm12345777 yea you can tell she did For a moment I thought Ayesha curry was the dish you guys were cooking ü§£ Hahahahaha Omg am crying Ayesha is dessert!!! Turdle Central hahahaha yaa m like where\\'s the curry üòÉ Ayesha was rude to Jen always given her back to her and not including her in the conversation not even giving her eye contact .

Aww I love Ayesha but I think she was a little nervous üò≠ Highly doubt it. Jen and ellen, we can tell the sarcasms hahahah This lady could easily do Meg\\'s voice in Family Guy, so so similar Mila Kunis is irreplacable Actually that\\'s so true. we should all be married to you ... lol @cynthia martinez she looks like hahaha bearded dude jen gave her the attention she‚Äôs been wanting The fact that the chef mostly talked to Ellen, an payed no attention to Jenny, I could litterly feel how Jen feels, so relatable üò≠ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è She\\'s a cook and she\\'s got Curry in her nameüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ...

Thats Mexican classic tf bruh I can‚Äôt watch this she wasn‚Äôt paying any attention to Jen my queen Chips and guac mexican classic I was just thinking that...not from U.S.A. hon You got Jennifer Anniston standing next to you, and this lady doesn\\'t even look at her. Steph could\\'ve done better. Easy now...  In all honesty, I don\\'t think she was being like that towards Jen intentionally.  Ayesha looked pretty nervous - there was a lot going on, and they were pressed for time.  Plus there were times where you could actually see Ayesha\\'s hands visibly shaking.  When in doubt, it is always better to give people the benefit of the doubt.

I guess she wanted to remind us how to notice being angry feels like ü§£ Hi More like 12:21 @Cucumzebrillionthe fact that your comment makes me angry- I live in a prison of rage. Pray for me to be freed! @steven oliver I\\'m not even religious nor do I pray much but \"I don\\'t know you so \"\"can\\'t\"\" pray for you.\" Is an awful thing to say. You should leave the prayers to people who do care. @steven oliver God bless u but we don\\'t need to know the person to pray for them we are all love all one on same journey in. Life I\\'ll pray for him God bless u I feel same so many harmed me thru out my life I\\'m so angry inside at those who destroyed my life going to start journaling to see will that help release the anger @DON ROGERS bless your heart and thank you so much! What an amazing person you must be to feel free enough to bare your most inner soul.  I\\'m not sure if you are the one with an anger issue - or if you are the unfortunate loved one of an angry person.  Either way - I\\'ve said a prayer for you.  \\nWhat courage you\\'ve displayed to seek help anywhere it might be found.  \\nFools often ignore sources too deep, and too hard to understand, when facing problems they can\\'t solve.  Wisdom is found of her children - and her children seek her everywhere they go.  \\nGood luck and God bless you in your search for freedom. I believe you\\'ll find it.  Many have, with the help of the unseen world, and an open mind.  \\nWe\\'re all connected in some way.  \\nAgain, Good luck and God bless.  (research your favorite color - your favorite animal - look into numerology) - you\\'ll find a lot of answers in them that will help you put the teachings of the Bible and other books of wisdom and guidance into proper perspective for your own personal life.  (color psychology is not mythical - nor is numerology for anyone who\\'s ever examined it.  Animal birth zodiac is also very revealing.  \\nThe month you were born played a very vital part in the world you know and the way you find true peace and understanding.  All a spiritual thing - that many will sadly ignore).  \\nJesus was the Lion of the tribe of Judah.  No one better to seek in prayer.  \\nWisdom is found of her children. \"Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die\" \\n‚Äì Buddha. @Red Glory Nosce te ipsum. But no one tells you how to not hold on, so I became a stuffer, people pleaser, who eventually would erupt, after that proverbial straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. @I D How, where, why ? @Rubim Ellmelech I would like to subscribe to your newsletter So the solution is to make your enemies angry...ü§î I‚Äôm definitely more of an erupter, I feel like this wasn‚Äôt for me @Aniruddha Keskar I think it could also stem from a need for justice. Over the years, I\\'ve been jaded by people\\'s duplicitous nature, everyone taking advantage of you or nice people  and by just the world in general. I\\'m becoming less and less tolerant and sometimes more and more irritable and angry. I don\\'t think ego is necessarily the root of it. This video is categorically not aimed at erupters -  it\\'s aimed at those who rise above us... or something... @MonteCristo this is me. It\\'s a thing? The older i get, the worse it gets. Im starting to feel hopeless @Aniruddha Keskar Like folks who suppress anger tend to be people-pleasers? The main problem with us is our egoistic thinking patterns that need to be changed 1.25x speed... is the best option to reduce your anger!!! this is impatience not anger It sounds like she‚Äôs talking on a reality TV show at that speed. 1.5x always I do it with every single video üòÇ their speaking speeds make me really angry Sumit Paul 4X for me :) \"anger reveals boundaries. Anger heals trauma. Anger inspires action. Crystal anger puts others in icu. And me in front of a judge. @kept hahaha well said true this. anger inspires me to hit a wall not to act rationally... Dear those who are so very impatient for having to listen to her story: I think that if you\\'re here, it\\'s because you have a problem with anger, or are feeling angry right now. The fact that you\\'re here shows that you want to act on it, and the advice of others has failed for you. Listening to her story is not useless, because she provides the context to understand what she then says. If you really want to change your relationship with anger, please open your ears and not leave an angry comment and leave. That only hurts you. Thank you for this comment. I think that a lot of people that are refusing to deal with their anger need to hear this. Or they and the people around them just need to accept that they really don\\'t want to get better. @DON ROGERS Yes, that was very insightful, thank you so much! \\nAbout your vision, I think that thay it is true that you\\'re an instrument of delivery to some rrelief, but I think angry people wouldn\\'t do that on purpose. When it is channeled like that, unconciously.\\nI used to be someone who would never get angry, just profoundly sad. When I learned to heal the expressing channel of anger, I seemed to get angry at many things which I wasn\\'t able to change, or small details or meaningless things that happened and I became overwhelmed by it very easily.\\n It seems like it\\'s easy to reach the extreme, but never the center, and that\\'s what I\\'m trying to move towards slowly @Andrea Albert   Sometimes people live in a silent rage that has no trigger and no purpose - other than to alleviate the inner storm that races through their mind.  \\nNo matter what you do - no matter what you say or how much you plead - and no matter how much you know - or learn - nothing will halt or hinder the raging torment that blasts from the minds of some angry people.\\nIt\\'s never you when a narcissist - or someone with an unsolvable inner issue - lets their inner rage loose on those around them. \\nThey\\'re simply taking a drug - a narcotic - and it\\'s called anger.  \\nThey inject it - smoke it - or snort it - using you as the instrument of delivery.  \\nThey\\'re not concerned with you at all - they simply need a hit of rage - and your the one that provides it.  \\nThey aren\\'t always bad people - and they aren\\'t always good people.\\nThey are just people consumed with the need for anger in order to release the unseen pressures they can\\'t deal with. I believe she is responding to some people who lacked the wisdom to understand the greater depths of what was being expressed in the video.   \\nI don\\'t believe this video was meant for shallow people or for those terminally unhappy.  \\nIt is more geared to help those motivated to know the truths behind angry people, and for those who have been adversely affected by them. \\nSome thoughtless folks made mention of video being less interesting than they should have.  \\nFor any intelligent and mindful person looking to make the world a better place - this video was invaluable.  \\nA lot of good thinking and ideas went into the teaching she\\'s presented. Thank you for saying it. Ppl are impatient. But the context to anger is the most important part. Breath.\\nName it.\\nDo it differently.\\nInquire. This is applied to people who know how to control their anger Thank you! i believe that this is what a person who is cool with all his emotions and know he is not them does Naturally. With some intention we can all get there. First of all, it\\'s OKAY to be angry, don\\'t ever let anyone tell you \"you shouldn\\'t be mad\" about something. The main takeaways are that 1) ANGER, like all emotions, is COMMUNICATION - it creates a physiological reaction to tell you something is wrong. If you can acknowledge in your own body what happens, then you\\'re a step closer to getting back in the driver\\'s seat; 2) ANGER IS YOUR ALLY; it doesn\\'t hesitate to tell you that either your boundaries have been crossed or something is wrong/unjust; 3) ANGER CANNOT BE CONTROLLED OR IGNORED! It persists until you do something about the situation that caused it. Emotions occur in your body, YOU are not emotions; think of them as friends coming to visit you, although you may not always appreciate their visitation, they usually have something very important to tell you. One thing this woman failed to mention is that THIS IS NOT EASY, it takes many many times going through these sort of steps (breathing, naming, etc.) before you are able to become friends with your anger rather than resorting to old habits (so have some compassion for yourself, it\\'ll take time). The greatest advice I\\'ve been given regards all emotions: allow them in, let yourself feel every part of it, don\\'t judge them or yourself, don\\'t react on them, ask them what is it that\\'s causing the commotion, and trust that deep down you know the answer. If anything you will gain more understanding about yourself. And please remember that if you turn your back on your emotions, you\\'re only turning your back on yourself, which is the greatest mistake you could make. Thank you. Agreed, thank you for this comment Well said, thank you AWESOME. when in a rage, you have to do these steps SO FAST, right in the moment or you get owned. Breathe (regain balance);  \"Name it\"/feel it/hear it -  gives respect to your anger, it then will answer, & if you listen, you can choose to give it what it wants...which will be something opposite of the desire to destroy.   Anger even rage are like the rites of passage to compassion, forgiveness, repentance (change) peace, understanding, Love.  GREAT, if people will practice, this goes to the core & heart of the matter, the relief & resolution you are seeking. thank you, we are so trained to supress our anger it s like ridiculous. Yes we are, aren\\'t we? Thank you for this. My grandpa beat my dad his whole life so no surprise as my dad also beat me growing up too. (Im sure I deserved some of them but not all). I come from a family of anger and i am no better. My son doesn\\'t have to worry about me striking him as I never have and will never but having him see me upset all the time isn\\'t any better. Am i doomed to always be this way or does anyone ever really change? I don\\'t think you can ever be a perfect parent. But what I really missed from my dad is being able to talk about what made him the way he is, what happens in the moments when he acts like that and to be able to share the struggle in dealing with emotions and learning from each other and past mistakes.  The only way to break the cycle is to be honest and share the struggle. If you let your child see you they will learn being flawed is ok, and that\\'s such an important lesson! Honesty about painful things can only bring you closer. Good luck! Do seek professional help. We need proper guidance to be better Same Feel you mate, realizing your problem is the first step towards fixing it I would say. When ever i get mad MURDER goes through my mind..i feel like harming people...the feel good harm\\n\\nKnow what i mean? My anger is focused at people and things out of my reach and control. Not sure how to remedy that without becoming an assassin of the 1%. Join the assassins\\' guild today! @Caio LopesI went Vegan 4 years ago.

If you can get the English to acknowledge their legacies on my country and their continued self priority in running it. Then I\\'l deal with the eco system up here. but until those blood drenched freeloader come clean. nothing will change.

(I think that was in this video - but maybe not). \\nI\\'m finding more and more that the perception I have of myself is the real reason the actions of a few others have a devastating effect on my thinking (and life).  \\nWhy should I put any value in the words and actions of others who don\\'t live in MY head?  \\nIf they are not physically attacking me - then they have no true power over me - except what I allow them to have.  \\nSomething like that - anyway.  \\nThis video was great for me.  I got to ask my anger and aggravations who they were and what they were here for.  It was a very eye-opening experience.\\nHousebound during COVID  - trying to learn things.   lol Dawson Davis me too, and I just can‚Äôt let go.

Searched \"anger management\" while experiencing an \"anger attack\" or whatever this is that I\\'m feeling. Now, I just want to cry. Thank you for this. I sometimes get really angry because people get annoying and stubborn so there is a fight.... I got angry when she said to breath Same Minute? Good one. üëç This changed my life I finally see the light for so long I let anger took over but now everybody loves me Sounds like that meeting with a shaman helped at the end :) \\'realised that my values were out of integrity with my soul\\' wow that really hit home I used to be  an anger stuffer and lately I became anger erupter Furui Ren Therapy is a SCAM it‚Äôs a Business. @Maggie May Have you tried therapy? I will give it a go...

I feel angry. \"I feel tension in my shoulders.\"\\n13:22 Do It differently- Try feeling compassion. Say \"I\\'m hurting. How can i be kinder to those around me\" \\n13:48 Feel the anger in your body- clench your fists and bare your fangs and growl. Say No.\\n14:21 Inquire. Your anger is trying to tell you something. With curiosity. ask your anger \"What action do I need to take. What do I need to see that Im unwilling to face.\"\\n14:49 Easy Way to remember all the above: When you flip your lid, there are 4 fingers of your prefrontal cortex that need to come back online: Breath, Name it, Do it Differently, Inquire The presentation was very \"acting\"...not naturally delivered...made me more angry watching... I almost want to rewatch this. It hit home for sure. I really appreciate this approach to anger management. It\\'s easy to talk about how to fix issues. But, to have a simplified, tangible 4 step process makes it a tool that I can use on the fly, and gives me a higher chance of success, than failure. \\n\\n\\nThanks for this presentation Juna! Very very very lovely and effective ... Thank you for sharing your gift with the world üíó I\\'m not quite sure if what I feel it\\'s anger or rather rage, I don\\'t know the word that could possibly describe this emotion but it feel like it poisons my entire self, I feel a latent repulsion towards everything and everyone, and it feels like my body BURNS from anger, my blood pressure gets really high, my strength increases, and can take injuries like it\\'s not a big of a deal, but also my mind gets foggy, can\\'t think straight, can\\'t think about anything else other than what\\'s causing my anger to overtake my mind. I\\'ve been like this for almost my entire life and it\\'s really difficult to overcome this issue, although I try to be calm all the time when my anger awakes it\\'s really, and I mean it, REALLY difficult to let that pass. I\\'ve been trying almost the impossible to overcome this problem but everything has failed for me. So, no, this video doesn\\'t really help me at all, it could help other people, but in my particular case it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nBtw, sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language. Thank you! This helps confirm my intuition and welcomes my will to improve with my anger, not without it. 12:21\\n\\nWhat you came for. You‚Äôre welcome. I just looked at the title waiting for my Sith master to preach. Great Ted talk. Why does it have so fewer views? I understand and I can relate to so much of this. I think the woman speaking is so brave and smart and i appreciate this speech! I really appreciated this message, and its simple and powerful presentation . \\n\\nThat\\'s not the way to make a fist, though, you can break your thumb! But its not for punching. Only presentational 7:23 Reminds me Al Pacino\\'s speech in Scent of a Woman Very educational and intelligent. Thank you for the insight. Words of Wisdom to share! OMG. This resonated with me to the core. I\\'ve been treating my anxiety and troubled psychie as depression now for 6 months. Last week at the weekly meeting workshop. I said I\\'m not depressed I\\'m fcuking angry and need anger management. Listening to this hit the nail on the head. I\\'ve been barking mad up the wrong tree. I see the light. Thank you Have you ever heard that depression is anger turned inward? So grateful this resonated Hudson, thank you so much for sharing this. Love it. I used to be anger stuff, but no more. Thank you..After 10 months of going down the list of addictions and emotions that I needed to address to improve my life , I finally got to Anger. I realized now , that I should have started with this one. Loved This, It really helped me. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve watched this video When I was in my teens, that movie Anger Management (one with Adam Sandler) kinda helped me understand that anger is not to be suppressed instead, be released in a healthy way. I can\\'t say I am successful at this every time, but at least I knew what I should be doing instead Thank you for such an insightful talk. Wow amazing thank you so much!!!!!i really helps I remember in elementary school I had a way to deal with anger or being angry at someone to be specific.\\n\\nI\\'d say it\\'s a somewhat healthy way rather than punching someone.\\nI remember if someone made me mad, I\\'d draw them tied up in chains crying, their mouth glued with hot glue and then taped with duct tape.\\nA bit psychopathic for a 10-year-old, but at least no one got hurt I called it that she was gonna say \\'I saw myself\\' Watching this video made me so angry, I punched my television. It\\'s okay, I get it. I hope u didn\\'t hurt yourself She recited my exact, raw life story! And now I know what can be done next, thank you! Lots of gratitude and good fortune to come across this. ‚ù§Ô∏è So happy to hear this Anahita According to abraham twerski write an anger journal. Look for that youtube video Thank you, I needed this so badly right now as my anger has come up through studying to become a hypnotherapist. ‚ù§Ô∏è She has such a soothing voiceüòç Wow! This was awesome! Very captivating and educating. Thank you, great work Keep them coming ;-) My story; Born in a violent household, violated by my parents 24 years, Married another abusive/controlling husband, rejected by my three children for divorcing my toxic ex. Violated by my ex 13 years after the divorce. These experience has made me hid my true feelings, I do anger internally within myself, but outside of myself I don\\'t. If someone upset me I write them as I don\\'t cope with confrontation as I afraid of being hit, this is from decades of violence I was tortured by. So My internal anger is justifiable and not poison like these people that have commented here. Bad parents cause the issue that why adults turn into horrible people or withdrawn like me.  There are about millions of adults who have been abused in childhood then never had a voice and even now these scars never heal. For the first time, I spoke to my anger.  In just minutes while pausing this video - I learned my anger was given to me just as my flesh and bones were, from my parents.  \\nMy father was a very angry man (unable to accept some war-related horrors)- and thanks to this video - I know he passed a twisted understanding of who I am, off to me, along with his anger in life.  \\nThe video was very eye-opening for me.  I\\'m excited about the prospect of learning to make anger an ally instead of a toy for the echoes of my youth.  Good Video. Yes brother, wisdom is justified of her children. Keep looking up, He\\'s coming suddenly. John 14:6 \\nKing Jesus üëë Powerful, thanks for sharing Don. Had to listen to this one again.

I\\'ll give my best kindness to anyone but when they start showing their attitude I burst out my anger. The lack of a letter ‚ÄúR‚Äù in her second name angers me This makes me laugh... thank you. They used to call me Juna Mustard in school  ;) Amazing. Thank you. i clean the whole house when i got angry, sometime my manipulative and lazy husband use it as a tool to just CLEAN the whole bunch of latenight beer bottles Omg that made me cry. Well delivered. Thank you Amazing! Thank you for share this! 12:00 4:46 is that a sneeze?! Yep, someone sneezed in the audience ;) The video that i was looking for for years, I just realized  a lot of things that i have note realized before, thank youuuuu So happy the video resonates Mohamed :) Great Ted Talk. Currently in an anger management class and this was a great listen to compare with my notes! Brilliant, wise, funny, and touching! Juna is pioneering the world of mindful anger. Love how she invites us to befriend our anger and use it for true good! Thanks for recommending this video! It wasn\\'t what I expected and exactly what I needed! Thank you. Felt like someone was telling my story. Can it be that I just saw you, Juna Mustad, breathe by lifting your shoulders and filling your chest and not your stomach with air??? Thank you, it helped a lot. This is glorious, been searching for \"what are the stages of anger?\" for a while now, and I think this has helped. You ever tried - Meyaarn Unprecedented Magic - (Have a quick look on google cant remember the place now ) ? It is a smashing exclusive guide for discovering how to get rid of your anger issues without the normal expense. Ive heard some amazing things about it and my friend got great results with it. Anger is a messenger. Thirst is to drinking, hunger is to eating, anger is to listen to the self and advocate in healthy ways and be your own social worker.\\nIt‚Äôs powerful though, it‚Äôs backed with action hormones (fight or flight) that once aroused needs to be calmed back down before listened to clearly and actioned upon rationally.\\nI used to be a bottler. I learnt that it was safer around my mother.\\nThen I became an exploder.\\nAnd now I call time out when I feel the anger hormones preparing me for fight and I take myself off.. I calm down.. then I figure out what was really going on and I listen and advocate. When I get angry I never hurt anyone, I just let it put quietly or start doing physical work twice the speed I usually do. Anger is energy, whether you use it for good or bad depends on you Thanks for this information. I am going to apply these tools. music too loud, speech too soft. My entire life I was a stuffer.  Then in my 40s I turned into an erupter.  I‚Äôm 48 now. Listening to find that middle ground:) Omg I hope my girl dosint do that Im only angry when im provoked\\n\\nSome say its because im 29 Best speech that I heard of on ted Appreciate it im good i can feel her angry thru the screen im out she got too much stress going on with her life! lmao im out! lmao the volume on this video needs to be turned UP 9:34 Go to Minute 12 and listen to minute 17.

That is the way we use the alt tag.\\r\\n\\r\\nI personally prefer the 2nd statement. I also know both are correct in their point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\n Now please tell me which one more correct and Why? 2nd one Awesome video About Black Hat SEO, is it negative to hide the main H1 with a screen-reader-only CSS?

As they bring more in they need to release more. That\\'s how \"saving a population works. You don\\'t keep breeding and keeping all of them,  that\\'s stupid. The stupid one is you. They have succesfully released 9 pandas since the re-wild program was initiated but there\\'s a process into selecting which ones are ready to go. They can\\'t just release  captive-born animals at the same rate they breed because not all of them will have developed the skills to survive in the wild. Are you seriously suggesting that if they are able to birth 15 pandas a year, they should release 15 other pandas into the wild to make it even? That\\'s not how it works. You have no common sense. Do some research before making dumb comments on issues that require a little thinking. If I was in a cage with people peering at me & inhibiting my choices of partner & privacy, I would not be able to \\'mate\\' either...and these people are SOOOOOOOOO noisy, too. It is disgusting. So what are you suggesting? They release 15 captive-born females into the wild so they are spoiled for choice and can do it in privacy then expect the ill-equipped pandas to make their way back to the reserve in 3 days? Your level of stupid is more disgusting.

Just to clarify, it‚Äôs very normal to grab cubs of all species by their necks , lions, dogs, cats, they all carry their cubs this way. Also, panda cubs are very durable, especially due to their habit of falling while climbing bamboo. Anna Mizzi this is bullshit! I am so sick of you ignorant saints. You thinks you know more and are holier anyone else. Put away your arrogance and educate yourself in pandas. Maybe you won‚Äôt be so ignorant, Throwing around unjust judgements and be condescending to the people who are professionals and actually saving the animal. Pandas are meant to be carried by grabbing their back skin. They are bears, that‚Äôs how their mother handles their cubs. You have to remember that this is in a VERY different country. \\n\\nAlthough they care for their Panda‚Äôs, they don‚Äôt treat them as well as other developed countries. Chancey Cattleman me too that was sad Not good for the visually impaired, subtitles don‚Äôt work. Bye bye It is very nice And I want  any panda is o hug Boring, if they can\\'t mate, their extinction clock is near, let hem be, the ccp should give the ppl political choice, not focusing on stupid panda are they forcing pandas to mate... They are an endangered species and time is running out.. you have to do what you have to do in order to save them. It would be beyond sad for them to go extinct and future generations to never witness the beauty of them. A lot of animals facing extinction have breeding programs. they would do better in the wild not behind bars being watched by everyone...horrible..who can mate like that? yes they are not very well treated..theyshould leave them ALONE.. in the nature...horrible place..like a jail They are endangered species time is there they are trying to keep them alive and help them reproduce and help them out would you rather them go extinct Maria DOLORES Rodriguez Ferrere de MERCADO pandas literally poop in front of your face. They don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt know about mating though. But I don‚Äôt think you should project human emotions to animal behaviors to derive answers. There are many possible reasons why captive mating may be better than mating in the wild, like budget, ease of observation for studying the behavior, etc. shame on them. They have imprisoned poor animals. They are endangered if they are not there to help then those gergous creature and the species can be no more I don\\'t want them to go extinct How do you expect that female to mate again she was terrified. Raped and attacked I‚Äôm no panda expert but mating her again will be hard to impossible. @Doppelganger D true they know what there doing I would rather let them do there thing then let them go Extinct bannane girl no you, they are right A W I agree really @KylePH and @A W\\nOk congrats thanks for noticing perfectionnists , I never asked to look all smarty-ass perfectionnist or so I just went based on my values , I‚Äôm not gonna argue on something that will lead me to nowhere : great y‚Äôall are educated in animals , pets or whatev congrats , don‚Äôt take me wrong I was just following my values and emotions so whatttt ????
