       " 'Amazon, the largest, the Nile the longest. @marj marj nope its nile mow Nile is the longest not amazon What\\'s the difference between the longest and the largest..? 9 Apparently the 2007 finding that the Amazon was longer than the Nile was overturned in 2009, or at least that\\'s what this website says:  https://triponzy.com/blog/longest-river-in-the-world/ The Nile is longer than the Amazon. Its actually true Ya Exactly....................☝☝☝☝ @Froilan Crisostomo That\\'s a very insightful explanation, I never knew that! In one single stretch Nile is longer than the Amazon. But Amazon has so many tributaries. I think it is included in the count. That\\'s  why in this video Amazon is the longest. Back then when I was in elementary I have a book The Book of Knowledge and World atlas. F i\\'m not mistaken Nile was consider the longest river. I thought the Nile is in 2 sections, \\nBlue Nile and White Nile. I live in Brazil, I know that Amazon is the largest river and Nile is the longest . Please , you should correct it. @Tarugo Zaka-Moko When you say larger is what river is wider. Amazon is far wider than Nile.Tho Nile stretches farther,  You can fit 2 Nile rivers inside the Amazon. The Amazon is not the largest; the Nile is the longest by 225 miles; but aren\\'t you confusing largest with longest..? Largest how...! No, the longest river in the world is the Nilo. The Amazonas is the largest. I\\'ve never heard of Don Juan pond. I figured he was my neighbors pool cleaner. Strange answer . Sounds like a trick question ! How is it the saltiest ?Have you tasted it ? Ha ha ha ! Don Juan Pond is part of the Antarctic Dry Valleys.  Kind of an esoteric question in my opinion. Lol this deserves 6k at least lmao 1:50 The first supercontinent was Rodinia. Pangaea came later. It\\'s called the Grand Canyon, no one had ever said \"the grand canyon of colorado\" The Amazon River is the widest, the Nile the longest No no no . Too many vague and poorly worded questions. Thumb down . Get it right and try again. Thank you The longest river is the Nile, Amazon is the richest in water! Palestine is in the near east?? Did you ever heard of the middle east countries?? Agreed ! What area constitutes the Near East ? Not generally recognised as an area ! @donremi76 According to the National Geographic Society, the terms Near East and Middle East denote the same territories... \\nhttps://sites.google.com/a/ngs.org/ngs-style-manual/home/M/middle-east-west-asia Geographically it\\'s near East.\\nIn Italy we call the countries from Syria to Saudi Arabia \"Medio Oriente\" too, but it\\'s not correct. As an israeli I\\'m surprised Middle East essentially supplanted Near East in the early 20th century, although the two are now used interchangeably among English speakers. So, for all intents and purposes, Middle East and Near East refer to the same region when used today. Nile is 6,650 Kms long\\n\\nAmazon is 6,400 Kms long.\\n\\nYour call.\\n\\nGoogle is soooooo difficult isn’t it ! Pangaea is spelled wrong and the Nile is longer than the Amazon. 19 The Nile is longer than the Amazon river the Amazon river has a bigger volume and the Nile is longer Latest measurements put Amazon as the longest.I just watch a month ago on National Geographic. Eddie Winxs1 yeah lake Victoria, but other rivers go into there aswell, but even taking the length of lake Victoria to the the Nile delta it’s still longer It all depends on who you talk to.   Some count either or both the Blue Nile and the White Nile for total length, but no one is really sure of the exact source of the White Nile since it emanates within a lake. Jetech U are right \"Yourupe\" 16 I\\'m delighted with that and even guessed a few Nile is longer than Amazon. Yakuta Senpai Nah Nile is longer Amazon is the largest Amazon îs the longer but Nile is the largest Nope Wow - let’s pray no one takes this as fact! Several of these are either wrong or somewhat askew! Saudi Arabia also dont have any river FYI:  While you most likely is telling the United Nations to FO.  Myanmar is the official name for the old country of Burma.  I believe its been this way for about 25 years, If your not able to get name of places correct.  Then your so call quiz also should be in question. Although the official name is Myanmar, the Burmese people I have spoken with have no issue with people calling their country Burma. The majority ethnic group of the country is the Bamar people, hence the name Burma. Most fun quiz I\\'ve done yet!!! Missed a few but a great learning experience. Yeahhh true...i even ended up I ended up checking the political map of the world, to remember some states I had forgoten...loved it learned lot 😊...I got 15/30 not bad I gues 😊 Thank you! :) All \"near eastern\" countries are still considered middle east. great quiz ! but, wait a minute, i know Canary Islands, and i knew that are 7 islands...\\nmaybe you mean 8 because you consider the lobos island as an another island , but isn\\'t it part of Fuerteventura?\\nlet me know, i\\'m curious @FunnyFriQuiz ah !! la Graciosa ! i heard something about it , but i forgot after :)\\nthank you for the information ! Before there were 7, but since last year the island La Graciosa is already considered as a main island, so now there are 8 Canary islands. I went back to the test to check on one of my answers.\\nWhen I said Amazon, I was sure I was right because the test said so, but, something is eating at my brain so, I\\'m going to check it out. A good quiz . Got 6 wrong :( pot is legal here in canada . My excuse :) Q14 \"Palestine\": Depends on where you look from. What you in the US call the Middle East is in Europe called Near East. @Michael Iversen \"I am from Denmark.  We call it Middle East\"\\nUnderstandable. Denmark is so much more distant from Palestine than Germany ;-). I am from Denmark.  We call it Middle East Exactly.I am European and we call it Near East. I answered 29/30 correctly,I didn\\'t know about the saltiest lake and I still think Nile is the longest river in the world although there are currently new measurements that says the Amazon is a bit longer now... Good questions and most of them were average but good job doing this channel. I have checked about the lake and it seems there is one in Ethiopia which is saltier with 43 % salinity - Gaet\\'ale Pond. More and more geography videos like this and I\\'ll  become a big fan of your channel. 5 wrong answers is not a bad result, but when it\\'s about Geography, I always aim for a perfect outcome. If you could also make more history quiz videos it would be great. Thank you, good one, I enjoyed it. However the guy made a quiz with a lot of mistakes in it ok It has only been since 2007 that the Amazon has been considered the\\xa0longest river in the world. \\nBecause rivers are constantly seeing changes with waterflow and seasons, it can be extremely difficult to get accurate surveys on length and distance. It wasn’t until this century that researchers had enough technology with GPS to make more accurate estimates on actual river lengths. Upon further research with these innovative technologies, scientists discovered that in actual area coverage, the Amazon is slightly longer at 4,345 miles to the Nile’s 4,258.\\nCopypaste:))from google :)) 10:05  they\\'re all nordic emeraldsroses it’s still not Nordic , I know Denmark owns Greenland but it’s still not Nordic @Ghost Data  Greenland is not an independent nation. It\\'s a part of Denmark, therefore it is a Nordic country by default even if it is located in the North American continental area. Greenland is not Nordic lol 17 alright 👍 Nile! 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️ Good quiz, otherwise. Pacific ocean Yes! 24 out of 30. That comment is true Nile is longer amazon is only 6437 km long The Amazon is the largest and the Nile is the longest, and you made some mistakes mister smarty pants. Longest River? Amazon\\n\\nGoogle: Nile\\n\\nbruhh by 225 miles..!! Colony???? The Germans would kill you  :)  Köln or in english Cologne.\\nNile is longer --\\nThe idea is good but you need to verify your data before putting out there. Its the NILE RIVER does he know that the Nile is the longest river in the world? anyway i got a questions correct I got 26 out of 30. It\\'s actually 27 if not to Amazon being the longest, I though twas Nile. Anyway, I love the quiz. You\\'re not wrong Nile is the longest and the amazon is the largest OMG! how bad I am at geography, I got 11 wrongs Nile is the longest river and Amazon is the largest river you should correct it \"The Nordic countries are generally considered to refer to Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands and the Åland Islands). ... Unlike \"the Nordic countries\", the term Norden is in the singular.\"\\nquoted form Wiki. \\n\\nThink the other comments have everything else covered. what about it Iguazu waterfalls is is a tri-border area along the junction of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil Beiging Shangkai what kind of pronunciation is that Usa have a 52 state omg why the answer is 50 hahahaha Nile- 6,650 km Amazon- 6,400 km. I searched it in google 22/30 ..i thought Nile is the longest river..also i dont know about Near East north hemisphere Stay at home,help will come 25 out of 30 20/30 you mispelled tajikistan You didn\\'t  know about the longest River . Geography is my favorite subject and I got most of the questions correct.  The quiz wasn\\'t that bad and the questions weren\\'t that bad.  Some of the questions I had to think about for a minute.  I surprized myself after being out of high school for about 4 1/2  decades. Surprise Amazon is about 6,400 km while Nile in 6,650 km Mong research ye facts u melon Australia? Kate Topp it is a continent, otherwise north+South America would be an island Pls easy pls :( Q.3 Atlantic Ocean My score 14/30 Very easy. 30 out of 30. The Nice is longer than the Amazon and I asked 20 questions . Q.2 tokyo Palestine is in the  Middle East !!!!!!!\\nY Near east? The Amazon and the Nile are both the longest river in the world. It just depends on who you ask, what sources you use and how you measure it. That is why if you make a Kahoot about it you should marc them both as correct or only include one of them. Good test, very informative, I luckily only missed 6..... 26/30 so where is Don Juon Pond?  i thought crater lake was the deepest.never heard of Baikil? as for the Amazon  vs Nile it depends on the book your reading. Q. Where is *Don Juan Pond* ? \\nAns: *Antarctica* looks like none of u guys are happy with the quiz Aren\\'t Near East and Middle East the same? 28 of 30. Nice quiz! 14 out of 30 I git 19 correct answers lol 29/30,no bad. Nile: 4,132 miles.\\nAmazon: 4,000 miles.\\nYangtze: 3,915 miles.\\n(The\\xa0Amazon\\xa0is considered the world\\'s largest\\xa0river\\xa0by volume, but scientists have believed it is slightly shorter than Africa\\'s\\xa0Nile. The Brazilian scientists\\' 14-day expedition extended the\\xa0Amazon\\'s\\xa0length by about 176 miles (284 kilometers), making it 65 miles (105 kilometers)\\xa0longer\\xa0than the\\xa0Nile.Jun 18, 2007. 17/30.. ;-; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni\\'m a dumbass Amazon The Nile is longer than Amazon 50 states But the longest river is Nile about 6,650 km My score is 55 Nile is the longest river! Where in Europe is the city colony located? I know all european cities over 100k population and never heard of it I only got 16 out of 30. Very poor in geography though 23/29*\\n\\n*I don\\'t consider the disputed question about the longest river. Never heard of a country called Tajistan 7:54 *Tajikistan* (not Tajistan) I Guess it\\'s okay,I got only 22/30 and I thought Nile is the longest river... You were correct- it Is!!! I dunno, ask the video creator But why Amazon is the correct answer... It is the longest river How is the Amazon longer than the Nile? The Nile is the longest river, not the Amazon river Terrible quiz: poorly written (It is not the Grand Canyon of Colorado - simply the Grand Canyon), wrong answers (The Nile is the longest river in the world at 4,135 miles; the Amazon is the most voluminous).  I could not finish watching this poorly produced video, filled with wrong information.  Please stop polluting the internet w/ your stupidity. Actually In accordance with the latest measurements,Amazon is the longest.Stop being nasty. That was a tough one I got 19/30 got lucky on a couple I was not lucky😞 Grenland IS one of the nordic countries!  And Nile is longer than Amazon! @AFCA 1900 Don\\'t say that to the Greenlanders. They will feel offended. greenland is danish  territory Question 2 should be Guangzhou.. I am going to read the comments Mariana trench is in pacific ocean Nice video finally a nice comment near east and middle east are the same thing Nile is longest rivet in world ',\n",
       " 'I’m so sorry to anyone who has lost someone to this💙 @SeedPlanter - You could be right, but why chance it?  I fear that the worst is yet to come. Delayed cadaver disposal comes with horrific consequences. It\\'s all made up! To just the virus itself and without any pre existing condition or dying of something else already? That would be about 1/4  of the deaths. In other words...this is and never was a pandemic ! some serious stuff I pray for the less unfortunate and those who didn\\'t make it through the virus you know that you know I pray for their family and that they will heal from grieving God is good You don\\'t know what the curve is, until all this is over. My son used to have a wicked curve. It would be coming straight at a right handed batter and he would think he was going to hit him and then it would break over the plate for a strike. Classic #facts\\n Truer words have never been spoken The curve is still exponentially rising with no end in sight. This virus will wipe all of us out. @not alejandro https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/tokyo-governor-tells-residents-to-stay-home-to-avoid-coronavirus-explosion?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15868328473174&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal-development%2F2020%2Fmar%2F26%2Ftokyo-governor-tells-residents-to-stay-home-to-avoid-coronavirus-explosion @Mark Hanson as soon as we stop washing are hands and grabbing are balls. it\\'s not over yet @Freddy Gibson 😘 @Chase Mcdude You are actually braindead. No its just starting in the us. Theres others smaller cities towns and rural areas. @Onan Smith what\\'s wrong with my pic? Chase Mcdude glad u showed herlol If true curb flattens at 800 deaths a day, and keeps that number daily, that\\'s not good news! Get rid of that pleage the TRUMPAVIRUS !! @Flashy Paws Thank you so much for this description! You were really smart to keep moving and off your back during the pneumonia part of the ordeal. Good advice for everyone! Thank you. bless fyah    I’m sorry, there is plenty of that.  But, I care what happens to others .  If no one cared, then why would all of the nurses, doctors,  secretaries and janitors  get up every day and go help people fight a virus that can infect everyone and kills randomly.  Why would the officers try to help citizens by delivering groceries and meds to people at risk? why would the truck driver go out on a route for 2000 miles with very little food and no shelter available to ensure you have food on the table for your children.  People everywhere care and they want to help. They want to know they did something important to contribute. As horrific and sad everything is surrounding this virus, the first thing I see is the care people are giving behind the lines........What about The commander who sacrificed his entire career to help the people he swore to lead and protect.  The nursing assistant who stayed for hours and held the hand of a man she didn’t even know to calm his fears as he died.  The people of the entire world are at equal risk.  Everyone, all over the world is having to drastically change their life as well as aspects of their entire culture to help save people. We are seeing huge random acts of kindness and bitter corporate enemies joining forces to find answers.  Horrible things are happening. But, this virus is also showing how much people care for others across the world. @Flashy Paws I\\'ll just smoke weed and drink monsters to stay awake when I get it then “Thank you”to all first responders,health care workers and all essential workers! I stay home for you guys! Not even close to  solving the problem. @ars660 there\\'s 1 coming out by may.but i wont take it. Exactly. It\\'s refreshing to see someone on here has common sense. As a biochemist, I can say we are about 18 MONTHS away from having a \"solution\". The bottom line is everyone is going to come in contact with this virus and if you\\'re in good health it may be best so your body can go ahead and create the antibodies. For those who are vulnerable, we don\\'t have a solution quite yet other than avoiding people. Unfortunately, more people will die. This happens every century. It\\'s part of science. Trump be like: lol there won\\'t be a problem to solve if u all die Poor Fauci, I think he got bullied into pulling back on his statement. Just my opinion btw @Ritchie P. 😁😁😁 @Ritchie P. well I enjoyed chatting with you.. have a good night, heading to sleep 😁 @Ritchie P. lol @Ritchie P. haha..hey at least we had a laugh tonight which is better than the alternative @Ritchie P. no..it was an absolute necessity for you to know the ipsy magic lol..tee hee Dr. Fauci: You don\\'t make the timeline, the virus does. What happens when everyone comes out?the virus is still there, I guess round two. @Tammy Forbes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Round 2 of the death plague. @Tammy Forbes keeping distance is not fool proof just stay inside more this year.  The virus can float around especially indoors( elevators are the most dangerous it was how the SARS super spreader infected a entire hotel in 2003) which make social distancing very ineffective. Ya after we open up the economy we\\'ll still have social distancing regulations in place Trayohesuea Vanderbilt nope we know to keep our distance now i agree with Bill about keeping the school closed as needed @Michael Burke    Michael, this will strengthen you:\\nhttps://youtu.be/YpeU6PcJd_w @Lisa Fleury im only thinking this way Lisa Fleury because im currently in quarentine the last 2 n half weeks with serious respitory problems with nothing remotely like flu symptoms God bless @Michael Burke You are 100% right. @Michael Burke ever hear of coincidence there are plenty that don\\'t have 5g that are getting virus now I\\'m not saying 5g is totally safe but it isn\\'t causing coronavirus  these types of viruses have been around since before even phones look at Spanish flu black plague ect it is just ppl are looking to blame things that they never except the easiest of explanation @Shirley Mccrindle please watch(guy who qiut from installing 5g towers)a fellow american These are difficult times that we will have to overcome, amid many problems that the global pandemic has brought us. \\nGood luck to everyone @Janice McKeethanks .

It just takes another wave 🌊 and then the numbers double schools run here in NY until June 21st so lets make it July 1st. I mean why cover 4 garunteed months of UC benefits for everyone if you\\'re only using half of it? They might wanna keep some harder hit states at 30% capacity until June 1st SHUT DOWN NY..QUARANTINE THE WHOLE STATE ALREADY!!! @Leesa Lovely i also believe there should be atleast 2 week break every year that would be the real \"earth day\" Kelsey K,😂😂😂😂. It\\'s sad...but I\\'m looking at this as the earth cleansing itself. Have you seen the YT videos about how nature is responding to the now quiet streets of generally bustling cities?!? They\\'re  quite telling....\\nHumankind needs to give the earth a break for a full month every year. Kenny Michael Alanya, not in Maryland....I keep trying to figure out where all the people on the roads are going!!!! There\\'s STILL too much traffic! I agree. USA cases is way to high @Copernico Felinis yeah corona is serious The dumbest person happens to be one of the the most powerful men on earth. 🤦\\u200d♂️ You must be talking about Biden! So true. And we know he’s dumb because he’s too stupid to even know it. I’m not sharpest knife in the drawer either but I will tell you exactly what I can’t do or what my weak areas are. Good Christ Trump is stupid 🖕 Without widespread testing, contact tracing, and quarantine, it\\'s all wishful thinking, not science. @CC Ryder you could test people morecthan once Einstein. Martin Brodie this what our public ed has produced @CC Ryder Donnie doesn\\'t understand per capita either..lol..sound of dueling banjos!!! You\\'re 100% correct. @CC Ryder pay your mom a little rent and then educate yourself. May the Lord welcome these 10,000 to heaven and comfort their family and friends and keep them healthy and safe. @ARJUN BROOKLYN seeing is believing I guess.  And this fact alone is why the pandemic will continue to exist in USA and I have a feeling USA will be the last country (western world) to have this disease. \\n     I already witness evil itself and it\\'s scary.    What I witness was like a scene out of a horror film but I did deserve it because I did bad things (not life threatening though) @Kenny Michael Alanya I prefer to read my fantastical, mythical, fictional stories through books like Harry Potter, Games of thrones or Marvels Comics. @ARJUN BROOKLYN Psalm 91 actually specifically speaks about Pestilences.\\n  Keep your guard up.  Prayers do work and some DID in fact got better through prayer alone.\\n    But believe what you wish to believe ARJUN BROOKLYN look how it brings people to work together and look out for one another during a time of crisis. Your imaginary deity supposedly has loved to inflict plagues upon humanity since biblical times. New cases and active cases still too high. NBC is censoring comments that go against the official narrative! Why? Look up the word planning. Please do not let ur guard down, the virus is still out there spreading @Bryan Rogers thats my fear. Once we reopem things there could be a second outbreak Yup and it’s not going away anytime soon. They’re gonna reopen the country at some point but it’d be such a terrible idea to just get back out there and have it spread all over again Bc it’ll still be out here!! As long as there is ONE case out there nothing is safe. I don’t know how they are gonna even think of starting up business but they must have an idea of how to handle it I guess. trust that! How is the curve flattening!!!!? I’m legit keeping up with worldometer 😂😂😂😂. Wtf is going on? 😂 joe momma this is how I know you’re too stupid to know anything. Worldometer info is a live update website that links credible resources such as the CDC count of each state and county. You’re too stupid to know that so I’ll let that pass Do you verify the stories they tell..or just run with the headline of their amazing stories? @edmundo oliver yeah that what I meant... studious thieves. we have a 2K year old temple sculpture depicting that @Fire Ice active total cases continue to rise but the speed at which they are rising is lower. \\n\\nIf there are 5000 new cases per day in 3 weeks then most of the original people today will have been recovered already or have died, lowering the total active cases. \\n\\nI do see your point though. \\n\\nThere are a TONNE of Active cases which are unresolved which will either result in death or recovery. This isn\\'t even close to over Flattening when new cases are the same or lowering.  You have to imagine the graph with the same data points (cases) every day instead of going up, then that\\'s flattening.  It doesn\\'t mean there are no more new cases.  Deaths is a separate curve/graph from confirmed cases. Money before everything else. What’s new? You are really selfish because people still need to eat. Only self centered people with food at home would say that. the big buisness are getting most of the stimulus and are going to buy the whole country because people can\\'t afford to keep their piece of the pie. the longer we are waiting the less we can hold on. Its not that cut and dry.. Imagine how many business owners will lose their businesses over this. In areas that arent even really affected. It is not the place of the government to place restrictions on its people. Check out the constitution. I miss the theme intro song. It\\'s so dramatic. And now I\\'d like to hear again from all those who said the seasonal flu was worse than the \"hoax\" covid19. Over 144 Ameican children died from the flu this year. We have no official Covid only child deaths in America. New York inflated Covid deaths without even positive tests. 500-700 DEATH A DAY.. CURVE FLATTENING?? THE ONLY CURVE FLATTENING ARE THE STOCK MARKET!! @SeedPlanter u do realize it is killing some healthy  young people  too Day death? @SeedPlanter it\\'s not all about you.. there is a reason why they are talking about EVERYONE staying at home, not only sick &/or the elderly bcs you can be healthy & spread the virus to others who then spreds it futher.. you stay home to not risk carrying the infection to others..\\nYou still get infected no matter your age or health status, so you can very possibly still get sick, just not as sick that you\\'ll need a ventilator.. There is still a huge risk that even you can catch this & that you will get more severe symtoms of the infection.. it\\'s not at all that black or white.. and this \"im healthy & young, I\\'m not in risk of cathing it\" - attitude is killing people and just wishful thinking from your part.. sadly the virus dosen\\'t obey your wishful thinking.. @JHOSTIN TOLA And what\\'s the problem? If your not healthy stay home! Us healthy people dont fear this disease because its been proven statisticaly not to be deadly to us! So excuse me .I have to help my country get back to normal. We will let you know when it\\'s safe. Dude...this isnt and never was a pandemic! This is war on your freedom. Get grandma her beer !!! Rules and Laws of God?\\nhttps://youtu.be/oDpMTnIF_M8 Leave them school close before you have more death on your hand especially children Mrs. Jmw Stoooopid @Stacey Mair I work in a high school,  and as of right now in NY, we are closed till the 29th. We don6know what comes after Yep..here in Atlanta schools remain closed for the rest of the school year.. \"its just the flu\". If you REALLY felt that way, believed it, and went around spewing it like truth ...YOU. ARE. SHEEP. We need you guys to WAKE UP. Did anyone catch how he said that she said she lost her own life ... meaning The girl that worked at the nursing home Valeria ... how can she say she lost her own life when she’s dead... smh at the news ... 3:40 Nice chest and tats, A. A - \"The family\" said. Trump: \"The States are on their own\".\\nStates: \"Fine, then don\\'t tell us what we can or can not do\"... @Mark Kountz Who\\'s Will? How did he get into  the conversation? @SeedPlanter As you said: You can\\'t debate with ignorance.\\nAnd I say: Will then stop using your Ignorance as you try to debate. SeedPlanter It\\'s a Very simple question, What has Trump done during his time in the White House?\\nYou can lash out at me as much as you would like, but that doesn\\'t answer the question. @Mark Kountz I cant debate with ignorance. You have to be educated in the subject matter in order for me to properly school you. Ya dig? I can assure you of one thing though. Fear is how they control you and truth is what they fear...Got truth? https://youtu.be/GYX7kR0_ZRI @Almir Júnior\" they dont want me they want you\" President Trump...Just the fact that he still stands for our constitution and the people makes him the greatest president since JFK! Period!  He is the only thing that stands between the democratic new world order takeover and our freedom. You will be a slave in your own country and never even realize it! Those who dont move dont see their chains! https://youtu.be/GYX7kR0_ZRI So as long as everyone hides under their bed everything is fine.  Got it. @Jan J I don\\'t drink but that glass of wine doesn\\'t sound bad at all. Jan J, turn up some Eric Benet w that glass of 🍷 and enjoy it.. Kim Sassman - lol. Steven Skaggs - In defense of the new shutins, liquor stores are essential. When you tire of those 4 walls, YouTube and quite possibly those you\\'re trapped w, you\\'ll need a glass of Merlot. @Tani Lee in communist countries. Not here. I don\\'t think. My opinion. The government tracks our every move. Meaning they know how many people are really sick from this virus. We democrats need to VOTE in November to “change the channel.” the president thinks he\\'s god 🤦\\u200d♀️ Aangel Phillips what would you do if you were President? He is in a no win situation. He will get blamed for deaths or he will get blamed for the bad economy. Just admit that no matter what he does you people would never be happy!!! Boom! the virus will disappear like a miracle! Bang! the sound of economy collapsing and not coming back! \"20 year old said she lost her life a week after getting sick\" what?? Sirena Chantal they must not have a lot of editors in their team 😂 Kiddinggg Agreed, that was confusing. It sounded like she spoke after she died. Poorly written! @Old Account I think you missed the point.  The article says her family said it.  \"20 year old said she lost her life a week after getting sick\" It’s true! I’m from Riverside. There’s a press enterprise article about it. https://www.pe.com/2020/04/13/woman-20-who-worked-at-riverside-nursing-home-with-outbreak-dies-from-coronavirus/amp/ LOL.  Maybe fake news.  Maybe not. I agree with governor Cuomo \\'s advice good idea to close schools and helping to flattening the curve It\\'s important to our sense of peace to have our children close, and children certainly need their parents right now. Cuomo told DeBlasio that he can\\'t decide that Schools will stay closed on his own....but Cuomo can\\'t make the call on when it would be safe and functional to be able to open. More curve flattening BS I need another beer...... @Leudwig vonshwartsenhelm The thought process here is probably \"Can\\'t die from COVID19 if I die of liver failure first!\" Save some beer,  the supplies are gonna be short soon Have one for me please So do I, but you should know that alcohol weakens your immune system....... do you? im in It\\'s over restart the economy now, enough with this drama Stay positive and Stay Healthy. “But Curve Is Flatening”, I can only see humans flattening at a grave scale\\nHospitalizations are low becoz::\\n1.) 130 millions do not have healthcare \\n2.) Over 60 millions are underinsured.\\n3.) 17 millions have lost their jobs, so does healthcare insurance \\nNow, 130 + 60 + 17 = 207 million\\nOut of 330 million population 207 million cannot go to “For profit Healthcare” system until they have Life Death situation.\\nSo it is totally False for “For Profit Media” to say number of Hospitalizations are Low and not disclosing the real fact why? Absolutely, that\\'s what it is And they are not testing Guess who owns Smithfield  China. @Janice McKee lol smh The Chinese do love their pork. Domestically, their pigs are quickly dying off. Seems like it\\'s one scourge after another for China. @Di&Ce -  Everyone needs to take care of their own pork belly. According to health experts, a pork belly has a limited future. Janice McKee invest in pork belly futures. Stands to reason. Pork is a favored meat in China and their own livestock has been rapidly dying. This is going to start all over again if they open on may 1...be ready This sucks I will lay the money down for a front row seat to the first sporting event to return to my town!  AMERICA STRONG! Close Smithfield Foods Also GE and AMC theaters So when it was time to shut everything down, it was the states’ decision; when it comes to reopening its Trump’s decision? Everyone is paying a price including the school children, I am sure they can make it up with some extra time!! Dr. Fauci please stay strong, take good care of yourself. Freedom isn\\'t free it is actually about 2.2 trillion dollars and your grandpa 🛂🚯🎭👻 Welp.  Guess that means this virus will stay with us for awhile😓 Your grandpa not mine. Love how the Dr. neatly sidesteps Bozobrain. He is a true gentleman! Stop it. The curve is not flattening. \\n\\n1.) ICU beds are down because they’re dying \\n2.) reporting of cases is down because they have literally stopped testing people Shahin thank you for pointing it out! \"Hi, I\\'m a reporter.  Hi, I have no idea how to wear this face mask\" the tonkin war was based on lies \\nthe war in iraq was based on lies\\n911 was done by our government \\nwho do we trust.\\nthey lied about weapon of mass destruction in iraq. media is always lying. who do we trust?\\n they spray chemtrails in the skies for us to breathe in.... who do we believe? leaders only wanr to protect their position \"someone ate a bat and now i\\'m unemployed.\" - 2020 It is starting to be admitted this virus was bioengineered. Don’t believe the bat propaganda. Heck yeah Grandma We both want or need more Beer🍺💪🏾💯💯🍻🍻🍻😁😁😁 Ben Franklin \\nyou know what i want?\\n\\n\\n\\n🚀 The peak \" this week will be the peak\" groundhog day in real life 🤦\\u200d♂️🤦\\u200d♂️ That ICU nurse is very cute and sweet though. Bare down for the Long haul keep pushing....I will pray....we can do this... Curve flattening? But everyday you have 30000 more new cases, how is that flattening the curve? For one thing, people are dying so fast I guess they are not running out of respirators like they had expected to do. @joann Loves CountryLife You must be getting your \"news\" from Fox-the-fake-news-channel and/or from conspiracy theorists. I\\'ve heard no \"experts\" saying that Covid-19 is lab created. It\\'s just people like yourself who I\\'ve seen claiming such things. Covid-19 supposedly originated in bats and possibly moved into civet cats and then to humans, was what I heard \"experts\" saying.\\n\\nThe problem with any new virus is that people have never encountered it and thus have no immunity to it. Or so it\\'s believed. It was previously thought that humans had no immunity to diseases such as the Black Plague of centuries past, nor to HIV/Aids, which sprang up with a vengeance in the 1980s. But it turns out that a few people DID possess immunity for some reason, even to HIV/AIDS.\\n\\nMaybe immunity is the reason that Covid-19 produces no symptoms in some people, mild symptoms in others, and a more severe disease in others. And why for a percentage of people, including otherwise healthy people, Covid-19 causes death. Maybe those with severe illness from Covid-19 have no immunity to it, while others may have something that gives them the ability to avoid some or all of the symptoms of the disease.\\n\\nI may have caught Covid-19 a few weeks ago but there were no tests being done, so who knows. For several days, I had fever, a sore throat, and a dry cough, with symptoms being sporadic. I had a headache at times and one day of cold-like symptoms (a runny nose) and a very bad cough that day, which prevented me from being able to talk for a while. After several more days, I felt OK but now, weeks later, my asthma seems a little worse than normal.\\n\\nWas it Covid-19? Who knows, without testing. But I had only one day of feeling really bad and it was NOT a cold, so I HOPE it was Covid-19 and I breezed through it. Hopefully I now have immunity, but there is no way to know because they are not doing enough testing, dammit. And its also not clear whether having the virus produces immunity or not. @Shie H. cases are stabilizing because test is limited.you can test that many, you get that many cases. @Synthia Pyre that\\'s their only defense @Synthia Pyre that is their only defense 2 more weeks and we should go back to work. I need to go to with even with a mask and glove are fine There is confirmed cases in every state Trump to States Governors \"\" your on your own but we\\'ll try to help\"\" . 4:24 \"better days ahead\" You have no idea what\\'s coming. It\\'s not going to be better. And, no. I\\'m not referring to COVID-19. \\u200b@joann Loves CountryLife In a manner of speaking. Jesus called it a great tribulation that had never occurred since the world\\'s beginning. (Matthew 24:21) One of those freedoms that will go away will be religion when it subjected to a systemic attack by the world\\'s governments, including the United States. (Revelation 17:16) Agree..goodbye freefom Government Power Grab !\\nExplained By Politics !\\nMitigation ! Im glad to hear curve is flattening and hoping it will go down as cases go down soon. Lol.  It\\'s not * not tested and admitted I hope so too. But don\\'t be too optimistic about it. People with heavy symptoms are dying, people with mild symptoms are tested and admitted. Also, most people are staying at home. Thus the number will go down temporarily. The virus is within the population, and virus can mutate. If they did mutate, we will looking at second wave coming at us, even the ones who has recovered might get re-infected. Get ready for your forced traceable vaccine Amin! After this calamity, I am sure everybody will withdraw their money at the bank. Recession is inevitable. How come the states were on their own dealing with the virus but now he\\'s the one in charge of reopening the states.he\\'s the backup...remember We need Fauci, without him it would be 100% circus.  Thank you Dr for eating your true words.   you sacrificed your integrity for the sanity of the USA.  All if forgiven Sara before you praise Fauci you need to study his back ground.  He is the wizard behind the curtain playing Trump like a piano. I drove north on 99 from Bakersfield to Lodi CA today. Traffic was moderate to slightly heavy some of the way and 75% of the people are without mask. Very little social distancing too. Oh my God the sky is falling the sky is falling. I know it’s TRUE I heard on the news Keep all those beds and vents ready for 2nd wave once the country starts moving around. Get the PPE stocked up \\nNEVER AGAIN!! The planet hates us right now, but we aren\\'t helping by not having uniform closures nationwide. God Bless You All!!!! @Janice McKee Thank you love!!! Thank you, Aquarian23! Blessings on you and yours as well! Thank you everyone in the world staying at home do all the pre-caution all measure to fight this virus. ‼️😢‼️ 2:06 He looks like an enlightened being. They killing ppl Aww I like how a 90 year old Korean Veteran got a nice Birthday Keeping up the scaremongering agenda!!!! @ 3:38, Sincerest Condolences to the parents of the 20-year old nursing home employee. Wait a minute trying to work with maskes Al day 8 hours wat happens when you sweat and slips down or off  so your not all safe  to work I rather wait out for the cure . People help me out here  should we fight trump on this we think about our lives and family trump wants money to line his pockets. Fauci finds that the constant media attention/fawning admiration can be intoxicating. LuRes Art I am sure he is wishing it is all over as much as we do. He was on this job since 1984. I love social distancing! More ps4 time and all these great games coming out! Pull together people to do your part, as a world we should tow the load together. Put aside differences, for grems have no sides. Devil\\'s can\\'t even show emotions when they love one dies. Renae Broome you said a mouth full.   You are a very intuitive person always follow that The worse is not over. MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING. THIS SHOULD BE THE FOCUS. HOW DO WE PREVENT THIS? @Vox Seven how? @The Blue Wave more then you can ever know.  He is. God isnt helping. Curve not flattening\\nJust federal funding for testing was stopped this week what !!? 10k in New York City, or New York State? can the news be more specific for those who think New York is just a city? Hard to imagine the number is only the 1% of the whole picture I am not the nurse “ but I would like to go there to helping anything If I can Lisa Dao - Bless your sweet soul!  You must be self protective first.\\nChecking in on a neighbor or two will be deeply appreciated  at this time. Many of our elderly folks are lonesome,\\n frightened,  and would find comfort in a phone call or a wave from across the street. The Navy sailor that died was part of the NJ National Guard and an \"older crew member\" 10 effing THOUSAND!!! In one state!! Most of those under 60 people that died more than likely had problems before the virus There are more states with 20k infected but there is no way of telling with no testing. infected  630,000?😱😱😱😭😭😭 Why would you want to reopen the most populated and hardest hit states first?

       " 'I\\'m here to see Carmelo Anthony go ham 👌🏼 Yup, came to see what people meant by \"olympic Melo\".  He actually had some athleticism back then, and could catch and shoot with ease. Lebrun looks so scary with that hairline  @Goatbe Bryant nah he got a hair transplant. he looks like the Predator alien from the movie hahah Yooooooo lmao Lmfao he gets it painted now wow 2019s usa team was so bad youtube had to recommend me 2012s usa team highlights It amazed me how people actually though team usa had a chance this year....literally blew my mind @P. Dot Hey P. Dot , how\\'s it going ? keeping up with the news yet ? sad but true @P. Dot no one\\'s predicting anything here. All I am saying is the facts the previous teams are better. They can still win the FIBA. But obviously you are a deluded fan who resorted to calling names to anyone who disagreed with u. So good day, may the best team wins. @Chris Redfield lol u must be slow or something talking as if you can predict the future...nobody knows who will win what... but u talk as if you do already.. If u havent lost in a long time of course your first couple of losses will seem like the sky is falling to people who don\\'t know basketball. Kobe faked me with that ball fake 😂😂 Abhay kobe is a passer... stop disrespecting my nicca 💯😴 @Abhay 5 asst career wise proves different Abhay I was about to comment that lmao He didnt get me.cause I know he doesn\\'t pass 😂 Andrija Stepanenko Me too😂😂😂 \"Durant from his OKC teammate, Westbrook\" *TRIGGERED* @Brett Facts. It would\\'ve been more embarrassing if he stayed in Boston and became in Tatum\\'s shadow though. Plus I don\\'t think it\\'s gonna be the same KD after his last injury. @Nor Priest I think its funny how Kyrie left Lebron\\'s shadow just to be in kd\\'s shadow lol @Brett what about new duo kd and Kyrie? I felt that in my chest Who remembers this Deron Williams😢 I remember him, my friend used to be his fan, making me to be interested in NBA, so I never forget his name, he used to be soooo good... BBert yuh injuries killed his career Yes he used to be so good allen jizzinrogon bruh your second name 😂😂😂 allen jizzinrogon you act like hes dead...the only thing dead is his career Damn if we would\\'ve had this Deron Williams the Cavs might\\'ve had a chance lmao . Rollin\\' Up Bruh the nigga played trash. So did Korver, Shumpert TT and Frye.🤷🏾\\u200d♂️ Rollin\\' Up LMAAO!! That\\'s what I was thinking 😂 Its not fair lol No one cares about that tho. Even Jordan and Legends Team of Fiba 1992. Holy Hairline Batman!!! Guess the equipment manager forgot to bring Lebron\\'s patented triple wide head band.... @Jiggy Bah hurt bronsexual 😭 Underpantsniper L Underpantsniper lmfaooo Pan African Toad hair transplant lol @Underpantsniper it\\'s gotten better tho 5:22 Don\\'t do em like that Bronny That makes good for a street ball move +King Jojo Lol, that was dirty \"The Durantula extending those tentacles\" Now I see why he hated that name @Antoine baller finally Also anatomically inaccurate Mason Hamilton This comment is disturbing The passing of these guys is actually impressive. So fun watching perfectly played basketball You mean SUPED UP JUSTICE LEAGUE Basketball! LOL! GBR was like: \"Let\\'s never host the Olympics ever again or play basketball.\" safe in what University are u skunked(I’m from the UK too) SirTizz since when 🤨(I’m from the UK too) @Jack Redfearn well it doesnt, boxing cricket rugby football and others are more popular, its rare you even play basketball in p.e jack red basketball is probably close to the least played sport in the UK jack red nowhere near as in America or football in Britain This 8 mins highlight is much more watchable than 2019s usa team 22 mins game highlight You thought you appreciated this then until you watch it now almost 8 years ago. Free shooting and warm up game for usa Lebron before he got bosley Man this game looked fun, and crazy part is this is USA just playing around. Imagine if they actually tried. Lol Great Britain had no business being on the same floor with this team. no team did... Melo that dude!. Best Team ever only missing Dwyane Wade. This team was ..okay. Imagine spending 4 years qualifying for the Olympics only to realize that second place is the best you can do with team USA in the tournament. The last exciting Olympics was in 2004 Kobe and James harden is better at this point Chocolate Crypto no it’s 2008 2012 2004 (without the gold) then dream team ....dream team best team...then the others. 2:16-2:33 at 1/4 speed....damn Travelled doe Team USA 2012 would beat dream team @RetroMamba Definitely plus I believe you had the better versions of Lebron and Melo at that time as well Chris Cao 2012 team USA was very similar 08 redeem except they upgraded KD,  and had a better bench @RetroMamba But Boozer and Prince weren\\'t scrubs back then they were pretty nice but yeah probably werent as stacked as 2012 Yasin Ali 2012 had Kobe and Kobe was still nice af and they had heat lebron who on another level plus KD and harden. 08 also had Carlos boozer and tayshaun prince on their team lol, 2012 had no scrub on their team \\'08 had prime Dwight Howard a prime kobe and a hairlined lebron. I dont know butttt it made me laugh when the announcer said CARMELO with a GREAT DEFENSE. . Ü Jhay Monroe Ikr Pesos Coróña this is the weirdest video I’ve seen, especially when Kobe passed to melo, then melo passed it too 😱 that hairline looks gr8 who\\'s here after USA lose?? Not worried. If were our best players, then I\\'d be concerned. the UK has a national team in the basketball? Lol @Jadon McCullough theyre the same thing -_- Raphael Romulo no Britain does LeBron forgot to paint his hairline😂😂 Whos here after Team USA lose to France in FIBA 2019 ? lol Who\\'s here after USA lost to France? Duranchula extending with those tenticles 😂😂😂 Imagine all these people playing straight in there primes Scary. That hairline 😂😂 Dunk, three, dunk, dunk, three, dunk,dunk,dunk, three ...was that training? dunk party hahaahah If drose wouldn\\'t have got hurt I wonder if he woulda been on the squad. Would have been awesome Bruh imagine curry and klay shooting in this court 😓😓 Deancy Woodside they are trash. Don’t ruin this team \"No Shot Blocker\" Anthony Davis🤔 Back when KD was likable like Kawhi because he was a silent dude and a straight killer @Mitesh Kumar lmao catch me in miami where you from @MoobTubeTV come fight me once you finish puberty @Mitesh Kumar your the biggest L of 2019 I understand kd,being a silent person sucks, unfortunately I can relate 🤣🤣🤣 he\\'s still likeable, you\\'re just too much of a bitch Defacto point guard. Just getting practice in 7 years early whos here after Australia beat USA? Can someone explain to me why is basketball so low quality in Great Britain?? I mean, they certainly have a lot of tall, athletic guys, but why no interest in basketball at all? King Of Everything they cut funding basketball. Basketball is growing in uk.  Third most popular sport among 14-27years old. Probably football people don\\'t want competition I couldn\\'t watch all of it bc I\\'d try this the next time I played basketball and tear my acl They look so good man that\\'s fun to see When deron Williams is good... There was an agreement before the game. If the the US does not win by 70, Great Britain wins! GB went off! So sad seeing one team messing up the whole world AD\\'s game is so perfect to complement all these playmaking scorers in the nba Lebron needed this Deron Williams in the Finals. We miss you Kobe. USA team were playing with kids😂🤣😁 I like watching this cause the nba players play real defense When yo try to finish fast a domination game in 2k so you put full court pressure from the very beginning dunk fest. get rekt brit Teams should just recruit American rejects. So good players that aren\\'t good enough to make the USA team Tim Clark if they do that and 20 years later you\\'ll be like they come from some other country, don\\'t even speak the same English and they are stealing our jobs. Lol what Excellent job with the audio track. Kudos. pray for kobe😢 Ahhhhh good times, I was at this game. I fell down a bunch of steps and hit my head, but I got to whiteness Kobe and brothas doing their thing. So all good 😊 🏀 Only Team that can beat Golden State Emend18 not any more OMG, that carmelo is goddddddd Back then when the USA team was actually relevant Lol, Team USA is still very relevant. Can\\'t win every game. every be comparing the redeem team to the dream team....how bout THIS squad? babanks2 I kinda feel that. I love the MJ era but the thing everyone glosses over about that team is they didn’t have Larry bird. They had Larry birds corpse. Had they added shaq instead of laetener maybe. Jerediah Jedi This team is the better comparison and would probably win. 4 diff MVP’s, Young AD, Iggy, Kobe. The 3 point snipers alone. D Will in his prime. Tyson Chandler well above average defensive big. somehow i was expecting a step back 3 by Harden :D somehow the algorithm led me here Camp supposed consumer switch painful tradition stupid. Miss you Kobe!!!!!!!!!!!!! @7:24 🚀 🚀 Would love to see this intensity on an all star game Not sure why the defender bit that ball fake from Kobe. Of course he wouldn\\'t pass that ball 😂 2012 usa team will destory the 1992 dream team @PiloFried too early for some of them to get inducted anyways not a good point Tyron Evans well until that happens or if if all of the players on that roster gets inducted then your point is irrelevant PiloFried umm ok and soon all the players on the 2012 team will be in the hall of fame too umm no! everyone on the 1992 team is in the hall of fame! your delirous! lol Huh 8:01 Andrew Wiggins sniffing something back there. 1:30 \"no real shot blockers\" wtf Anthony Davis is in the team he joined the USA team before starting his NBA career.... of course he\\'s not considered a real shot blocker at that time, no matter how good he was in his college time. Old thunder teammate 😢😢 つよっ！ Why is it just the u.s highlights? Because gb doesn\\'t worth to be watch 🤣🤣🤣 Take that UK \"Boy they get to the other end real quick\" I don\\'t know why that\\'s funny to me lol I felt bad for Great Britain this game i see why .. Nah, British people doesn\\'t give a shit about basketball. When melo was actually good unfair hahaha FIBA Street 😂🤣👌🏾 That D tho. 3:46 When you’re scouting the comments for wafflers that say something like: nO oNe IN tHE uK pLaYs BaSkEtBaLl(It’s a lie btw) Love AD Those were days when melo was healthy 😢 Good times this USA team was stacked! Back when everything was simple Weak English farts!! This is how the revolutionary war started. The commentor just said 59 degrees. Great game💪🏀🙏 damn i miss daron williams.. Crazy finish AD!! About politician technology interesting automobile chairman This is just sad to watch 118 - 78 Deron williams where the hell were you on that cavs team lol Best national team played ever 🙄 This is hard to watch Melo the goat ',\n",

If not for that game succeeding in the west there would be no Dark Souls fromsoftwares magnum opus, for sure This is what Donald Trump watches every morning to get himself motivated for work. @Echo SD oh my god I heard it in his voice I can just picture him, looking himself in the mirror, pointing, and saying over and over again \"You\\'re the president of the great United States of America!\" Why did Michael cross the road?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n...because he is the president of the great United States of America It\\'s amazing how a Japanese dev, an outsider, managed to capture all the complex intricacies of American patriotism. @Dripik shut up @Dripik amen There also this manga called \"billy bat\" and it captured the american history perfectly. Really? This is basically whats on social media 24/7 the \"great\" united states and the ass kicking president and guns and explosions... Earthbound? I love how the voice actors are not taking their jobs seriously once so ever. Makes the game 10 times better. The girl just doesn’t give a fucc, while the VA for the President is trying way too hard and the contrast is hilarious I like how they\\'re clearly reading all the lines on the screen separately. I think just like EDF, japanese version is pretty serious. I like that despite how evil Richard is, he sounds a little clueless and very goofy. \"I\\'ll hug you to death!\" No one even mention that Richard was driving a white Shagohod at the end? “Richard!”\\n\\n“Michael.”\\n\\n“Richard.”\\n\\n“Michael!”\\n\\n\\n\\n*”Spongebob”* Hotel? Robert! No! This is  P A T R I C K \"Dragonzord!\" SHREK I’ve never heard something more American than someone repeating something someone smarter than them said and then saying wait let me switch to the grenade launcher imagine how hard Dunkey would\\'ve laughed if he took his blindfold off \"They shouldn\\'t call it white house, they should call it fight house\" \\nJodie have to be relative of Gex. I can\\'t wait for the VaatiVidya episode detailing how this fits in with the greater From Software lore. This is what the age of dark looks like This is set roughly 2000 years after the events of Dark Souls 3, in this timeline the ashen one became the president of the united states. You knows it’s a damn good game when you hear Dunkey choke on his own laughter. This game really makes you feel like the President of the great United States of America.\\n\\n9.6/10 a little something for everyone @Unedited Childbirth ahh @CJ_ghost no lol I meant the super overplayed \"this game really makes you feel like...\" joke that plagues every comment section of every game related video. Flying Gorrila @Unedited Childbirth and the reason is.... Debatable Imagine how good this could have been if it was made with From Software\\'s current quality and full effort. E3 2021: \"Metal Wolf Chaos: Remastered\" They did, but not this silly, check out their Armored Core series Better have the same voice acting or else I\\'m not putting down a single cent I\\'ll pay 60$ for the trailer The most American game ever made.\\nReleased only in Japan. It recently was released in the US for some odd reason I remember when I stopped by Grand Canyon here in Florida because I had to do a recount and an attack helicopter piloted by an alligator started attacking and the President of the United States drop kicked it out the sky and saved my Publix chicken tender sub but sadly I lost count and accidentally elected Richard as VP, sorry guys. At least you saved the chicken tender sub. It\\'s the most desired item here. Happens to the best of us When dunkey laughs this hard on a videogame\\n\\n\\nYou know is gonna be on his top ten of the year To everyone not living in America:\\n\\nThis is exactly what happens everyday. Ya\\'ll shut up i know Aliens are a normal thing in New York. Texan.  Can confirm. @Aylali Please come to Texas first.   🤠🤗🍔🌮🌯 @MrMango Good...RICHAAAAAARRRDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!! I can vouch for this comment 1:40 he’s saying “stoke up the barbecue” A game from the same guys who brought us Sekiro, Bloodborne and Dark Souls.\\nSeriously. seriously wtf. They should have directed the resources for this trash to sekiro DLC This game is literally trump after losing to biden. He gets to his transformer and kill the entire usa army. why am i just now, 8 months and multiple views later hearing “so long gay bowser” at 4:56 I smashed the like button faster than a Florida Recount @Bloody Jacket _Every party needs a pooper, that\\'s why they invited you~_\\n\\n_Party pooper~_\\n\\n_Party pooper~_ God damn cringe. I imagine the creator fapping over his algorithms beeing like. \"AMERICAAAAA\" And the reason is... *Because I’m the president of the great United States of America* I like how much this feels like a Devolver Digital game even though it was originally developed by From Software, A.K.A. the Darks Souls people There’s a reason Devolver decided to pick it up and release it in the west. It really fits their brand. @Kevin I know. I\\'m just saying they dont seem like they were made by the same studio You know Dark Souls came out 7 years after this game . Yeah and the rerelease was published by devolver As an proud American living in the greatest country in the world I can confirm all of this as being an accurate representation of our lives in The Great United States Of America. \"You really FEEL like the President of the United States.\" - IGN \"I\\'ll smash it faster than a Florida recount.\"\\n\\nHoly shit that one hurts \"This game really makes you feel like the you\\'re the president of the United States of America\"\\n\\n-IGN Disliked: It should make you feel like you\\'re the President of the *GREAT* United States of America! @Gemini *BECAUSE I\\'M THE GREAT PRESIDENT OF THE GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA* And the reason is... @Panda Panda They wont stop circlejerking. ok i wish this same exact joke stops getting used every single fucking video in the comment section it was funny for a little while but it\\'s just annoying at this point \"ill smash it faster than a florida recount\" hahahahahahahahaha \"Richard!\"\\n\"Michael!\"\\n\"Richard!\"\\n\"Michael!\"\\n\"Plankton!\"\\n\"Krabs!\"\\n\"Spongebob!\" MARIO! TETSUOOO! PIT! DONKEY! DIO The protagonist of the game says \\n\"I AM  THE PRESIDENT OF THE GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" every time he tries poop hard \"How about a reward to show my appreciation\"\\n\\n\"Oh a reward!!! OK I\\'ll take it\"\\n\\n\\n\"Poison gas will annihilate the city in 5 minutes\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"thank you\" Of course the antagonist is the Vice President. The only country strong enough to fight America... *is AMERICA* @Furry Destroyer haha, the tyrannical government was definitely South Vietnam. Ngo Dinh Diem was an absolute bastard and a tyrant, but the USA propped him up because he was anti-communist. Even after he was assassinated by his own generals, the South Vietnamese government continued to grow more corrupt and tyrannical every year. If there was a single \"bad guy\" of the entire war, it was the government of South Vietnam. @Từ Duy Ngọ \\nThey invaded to help the Southern Vietnamese who were fighting against a tyrannical government. The civillian losses were due to the Vietcong\\'s shitty tactics of dressing up as civillians which confused Amercian soldiers into who was or wasn\\'t a Vietcong soldier. @Furry Destroyer an invading army killing millions innocent civilians. I see what\\'s you\\'re proud of. Is that how American \"perform justice, spread freedom and protect human rights\"? well obviously, just look at the current administration. @Mr Obscene The fact that your country lost a war to Vietnamese farmers? This game is still the source of my favorite quote from ANYTHING: \"I\\'m gonna step into outer space. See you soon.\" \"I can\\'t turn my back on a friend. And the reason is... I\\'m the President of the United States of America\" This line has not aged well Nice web \" AND THE REASON IS, IM THE PRESIDENT OF THE GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\" When you can\\'t remember the name of the game so you type in \"I\\'m the president of the great United States of America\" This game is perfect. You are nitpicking and communist I win bye bye Schmidty030 ikr Can\\'t wait to starve to death The reason this game is perfect is because....\\n\\nI\\'m the President of the United States of America!! Don’t worry, he had his blindfold on, and his brother took the controller. Capitalism is not good as communism, capitalism has gold for rich only communism gets everyone has gold. I win bye bye. This is the Dark Souls of President Simulators I love the delivery on the \"Hello Michael, how\\'s life treating you\".\\nHe sounds like he\\'s the kinda man that could cause allot of damage, saw a boat in half and sell me the tape to fix it all. Really under appreciated editing at the end where Dunkey’s dying high pitched squeaks of laughter seemingly transitions into the fiddle notes in the credits song. Nice touch. When Michael Bay ain’t enough. This feels like a cross between Metal Gear Solid and Sonic Adventure. Thats why its so good and armored core Yeah no, this is game is literally if Team America was an Armored Core game Exactly @Studder solidus?! “It really makes you feel like the U.S. president”\\n2.1/10 \"I saved the grand canyon........you\\'re welcome Florida\" I honestly cant believe that there was a time where fromsoft just released shit like this. I love this video. \\n\\nAnd the reason is, \\n\\n\\nI\\'m the president of the united states of America. Bill Clinton: I did not have sexual relations with that woman and that’s because I’m the president of this great United States *of America @Storm Blessed this is like an OneyPlays comment @Meester Writer but hillary is not president AND NOW I\\'M GONNA TAKE AMERICA BACK. You had a golden comment and then you fucked it up by not using the right line. This feels like a Shadow the Hedgehog spin-off where you play as the president of the United States. I feel ashamed of myself for instantly thinking that. Whenever someone asks me why I\\'m doing something in the future, I\\'m gonna respond \"The reason is, I am the president of the Great United States of America!!\" “Michael!”\\n\\n“Richard!”\\n\\n“MICHAEL!!”\\n\\n “RICHARD!!”\\n\\n“SASUUUKE!-“\\n\\nWait- PLUS ULTRA!!! ALL MIGHT!! ROBEEEEEEEERT LLLIQUIIIID!! KANEDA When I was a little kid and heard about Metal Gear Solid for the first time, this is literally the game I imagined Thanks! As a European, I always wondered what America was like. Very Educational! It\\'s not entirely accurate. Our water has far less reflections than that. That water was too realistic. As a Canadian, I will now live in constant terror for our landmarks and giant robots. @The Man Emperor of Mankind Ah yes. The Alcatraz Canon. One of my most fondly remembered orchestral pieces. I remember buying the CD for it. Still have it to this very day. It was all covered in dust at the back of the rack, and the expiration date was still good. Dolphin H \\nJust the other day Michael flew over my house in his mech suit and blew up Richard again. It was cool the first 270 times, but now I hardly notice it. Good thing Michael has the Alcatraz cannon to stop Richard every time. \"I clearly didnt break the law because I am the president of this great United states of America \" Trump Think he’s saying “stoke up the barbecue” and “nice landing” \"in this game, the president is evil\"\\nhow? he seems to just be doing regular president stuff to me WOAH! You can’t just reupload the news! Someone’s going to get sued over this! Terrible voice acting, bad plot, terrible gameplay.\\n\\nAltogether I give it an 9.7/10. Has a little something for everyone! R I C H A R D @Weizi Its like that on porpouse though. 93% out of 5 and the Golden Trump Award This is the quintessential definition of \"so bad it\\'s good.\" Ign infiltration Easily one of the best videos on the entire internet right now. So what if it\\'s been posted months ago, very relevant game right here. A gem. Hands down worth subscribing to your channel after this. Big ups! I gotta find the voice actor and give *him* the Medal of Honor \"My heart and actions are utterly unclouded...they are all those of [JUSTICE].\" Ah Metal Wolf, the video game equivalent to \"The Room\" Nah man. The game is genuinely good. It just has cheesy dialogue. Damn. Good to see a powerful, independent black woman such as dunkey become the president of the great United States of America. Actually, Dunkey is of Puerto Rican descent, so he\\'s Latino. @Your Irrelevant wrong *you\\'re @Your Irrelevant are you dumb or are you dumb? Gay grandma* Grandma* 5:37 me running from my date when I realize she\\'s vegan. \"I\\'ll smash it faster than a Florida recount!\"\\nAs a Floridian, I can confirm that we have fast recounts Especially in 2000 This is the 2019 Remaster, let that sink in. (Yes I know this was made in 2004 originally) WW3 is trending right now and we still dont have this guy as the president. Dunkey on Twitter:\\n\\n\"Today\\'s video might get a little political guys.\" Good thing Dunkey isn\\'t or Peurto Rican descent Because I’m the president of the great United States of America I forgive you @GalacticHasYoutube because I\\'m the president of America and I\\'m sorry 機器人 why would you do that. Cable cars are a symbol of this great American City!!! \\n*proceeds to blow it with nukes* 2:26 The Flor disappearedー now it\\'s just Ida! This is the most accurate depiction of American life I\\'ve ever seen in any form of media \"Sorry I\\'m gonna have to cancel, I got to save America\" The president: Video games cause violence\\n\\nAlso the president: Yeah, blowing up cable cars in San Fran that is the symbol of this great American city. He\\'s trying to hide his identity as *The President of the great United States.* Soon his identity will be revealed & he will liberate us all by declaring war on the US military in a mech suit. @Floshjix02 he said it a year ago after parkland and again a month ago after the mass shootings I dont remember him saying that perhaps we should send him a copy of this game :P might change his mind. This game makes you really *feel* like Micheal The sexual tension between Michael and Richard really tied this story together! \"this game really makes you FEEL like Kramer\" - *Michael Richards* Every time he says \"AND THE REASON IS...\" I know I\\'m about to be on the ground laughing dog \"It has a little something for everybody\"\\n-IGN @Mega Zeta calm yourself, at least it\\'s not a dumbass youtube drama comment. \"0/10\" It really MAKES YOU FEEL like the president. -IGN And the reason is Everyone who makes this comment on one of dunkey\\'s videos and everyone who votes it up should be culled from YouTube for life President Evil : Strand Type Edition The michael richard thing is like a less epic “LIQUID “ screem from mgs4 I only clicked because Gundam was the thumbnail Never cringed and laughed so hard in my life Me at a party: \"Nah I don\\'t want to get political\"\\n\\nMe after 11 drinks: Turns out this game was funded by North Korea.

What\\'s fun is how the NYPD handle traffic tickets and illegal parking in NYC when the UN diplomats start getting too bad with it.  They just start towing all the cars. @Gods Bloody Hammer no u @Gods Bloody Hammer funny joke lmao \"Simp tax, which is what a premium Snapchat subscription is called\"\\n\\nMy lungsss 😂 @Francisco Manuel Sánchez Rubio S I M P @?????? They collapsed into a black hole as they compressed after all the air escaped from them via laughter. could be worse. you could be paying patreon of a dude who\\'s drawing thicc anime titties characters. you\\'re least with snapchat/onlyfans hour paying an actual woman, even if she\\'s a thot. not that I\\'d ever pay neither of these situations, but still. Or a Curiosity Stream/Nebula subscription. Onlyfans* The UK: You have to pay the taxes I want you to pay!\\nThe US: Didn\\'t we have this argument before? @Dan Sands No. They voted for statehood last time. The Republicans keep blocking them. @JSD Puerto Rico doesn\\'t pay taxes except programs like Medicare @JSD They pay very few US federal taxes, such as import duties. They do not pay income tax, which is the bulk of US tax burden. Also I do not see how that isn\\'t the point. They can vote themselves representation at any time, or vote themselves independence at any time. They choose to avoid both financial and electoral  participation while enjoying US protection. @Dan Sands That\\'s not the point. The Falklands are a UK territory, and voted to remain as such, they don\\'t pay UK taxes. Likewise the problem with Puerto Rico is not that they can\\'t vote, it\\'s that they can\\'t vote AND they pay taxes. It\\'s taxation without representation, which the US claims to oppose @JSD Puerto Ricans are free to vote for independence or statehood whenever they wish, and have, several times. They choose to remain a territory. Like the US diplomat whose wife killed a teenager here in the Uk last year by wreck less driving and scurried back to the US and claimed she had “immunity”... Imagine walking away from a mass shooting with your diplomatic passport. They do have immunity every diplomat does 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 @Abcde Fghij Please, do not feed the troll. Bruh, that reminds me of the story of the Canadian diplomat’s 14-16 year old son who lied to her about going to the movie theater with his little brother, and instead, had his little brother hop into the driver’s seat of their mom’s car (which had the consulate plates on it) and had him drive up to a drug dealer’s apartment. The dude then hopped out, ran up the stairs, and then runs out five minutes later covered in blood and gunshot wounds with a pistol in his hand, yelling at his horribly terrified and traumatized brother to drive as fucking fast a possible. I think the teen died from blood loss, but I can’t remember. This was like three years ago here in Florida. Think the guy purposely took the consulate car to claim diplomatic immunity if he was caught. To be fair the us doesnt waive  it because the like her, they do it to prevent a precedence, that would make diplomatic  immunity useless. \"it\\'s like charging someone for basic healthcare!\"\\n\\n\\nWe Americans be like:\\n\\nUncool. More like, we pay for better specialist care. @Guardian dude.uncool Yup, There’s a tax for that When people look up passive aggressive on the internet, there’s a picture of this channel. @Captain Dead420 Watch the video. Please elaborate 4:01 Including driving on the wrong side of the road, killing a teenager, then fleeing back to the US apparently. @Gods Bloody Hammer wrong @sean1 the1 ha Gods Bloody Hammer shut up. It’s only the UK. Come get her if you want her Gods Bloody Hammer shut up Showmakers is coming back?! Why didn\\'t you lead with that! One of my favorite podcasts as I was getting started, you always get such awesome guests \"The first time that the US and UK has ever gotten into a dispute about taxes\"\\n\\nBoston tea party: *Are we a joke to you* why do i feel anxiety when the rhyming continues @Vigilant Cosmic Penguin That video will be the one about bricks. Idk After 30 seconds passed I was half expecting the entire video to become a poem Someday, HAI will have a video that\\'s entirely in rhyming verse. THAT will be scary. Because you\\'re worried theres a small chance it might never end and you will be left wondering what on earth you just listened to if the whole video has rhymes Why is nobody talking about the fact that we can get a 40 minute special about bricks if we sign up for curiositystream I came looking for this, is the long awaited special on bricks really on Nebula? Can any curiosityStream subscriber vouch for this? “That would be like charging people for sunshine or air or basic healthcare, who would do that?” Nice @Matti L Sounds like California TBH AcridWhistle oh jeez I didn’t realize that was actually a thing lmao \"That would be like charging people for sunshine or air\"....Yeah about that\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_tax\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDjYQ1AE-kY\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlpdKatqB08 moshe gelt also. You don’t. Know how much 200K is... that is what my family spent trying to provide for my grandmother.. a cancer patient. Either 200K is not enough for you.. or your lucky and don’t get any bad diaseases \"Who would make you pay for basic healthcare\"\\n*Cries in American* @M B Damn, you must be really rich to pay this much taxes. Perturabo you are but it’s cheaper @Dan Sands Indeed, private sector doctors do get paid more than public ones, and usually have better work benefits as well. In addition to that, the private health care provider takes a premium for providing the service. That\\'s the whole reason to be a private entity after all. The public doesn\\'t have that cost at all, and it\\'s exactly that profit margin that private companies usually have to deduce from to compete with prepaid health care. Meaning that the consumer has a better deal all in all. A person in the US just paid 10k for a Covid test in the US. That would never happen in a universal health care country. Never. @Matti This may surprise you to hear, but healthcare professionals are fairly well paid. Healthcare professionals with the experience and skill to work at private providers much more so. Keeping prices of private care low enough to compete with free healthcare is largely pointless, so they rely on patients who don\\'t have financial considerations. I challenge you to sell an £800 blood test to anyone besides an oil baron. @Dan Sands That\\'s literally a price competitive edge when you can offer something that has been already paid for vs expensive. The  private health care provider does not only have to provide a good service, but also a. service that is not *so* expensive as to make others reconsider and remain with the public health care provider.\\n\\nThe gap between price and quality/attainability of service has to maintain a reasonable distance, or otherwise people will stay with the public option.  In a well managed public system attainability is moderated based on need and to a degree price, and quality is good. In a well managed  private service attainability is moderated by price and quality really heavily depends on price as well. The public option is still a price. competitor, price is just not the only factor in the equation. I live in DC and diplomats always break traffic laws, it\\'s really annoying @Gods Bloody Hammer nobody asked Gods Bloody Hammer The US? The US never conquered/taxed India like the British did. The reason why US, UK owes India $10 Trillion   https://youtu.be/ixJgY2VSct0 🤣 \"Simp tax\" you mean pokimane twitch sub? @damnLad bro..... did you just SPEAK????? to that FEMALE??????

Glad to meet a fellow watcher. @Z Shieh it\\'s harder to see if someone is sarcastic when they write than when they talk. And yes, i watch Oversimplified “The United Kingdom is suing the United States in international court over unpaid parking tickets” @Sam Sitar agreed, except for the fact that the US does not acknowledge the international court so they will still refuse to pay and then the option would be war... For not paying parket tickets :D yes UK should sue the US for that. \"Simp tax\"\\nJesus dude, you just freakin killed him!

Pure genius! 4:05 what if they committed vehicular homicide while in the foreign country? like say the United Kingdom? Well, as it stands only Sweden has paid the USA back for both lend-lease & post WW2 aid.  So the Brits could just deduct it from what they owe the USA from the 1940s. Pretty sure the UK made their final repayment in 2006.

As soon as you mentioned the Congestion Charge I knew where you\\'d be going with this video, but the beautiful wordplay at the start more than makes up for it 😁 Your timings of the congestion charge were different to the image of the congestion charge sign you showed. This was because the timings you provided on the audio were the new “post covid” timings while the sign pictures are the usual times before covid Mistake at 0:20\\nThe British ceded Florida to the Spanish after the American Revolution. There was never a time in history where the US was independent and Florida was British. You lied their is still no 40 minutes special on about bricks on nebula (T_T) @jur4x omg I didn\\'t know ! jur4x 😂, now i have to see it @Sharp Pig well, it is a documentary about how Sam was arrested for disclosing secret information  after feds figured out how he hides it behind 30 seconds of talking about bricks. Legal Eagle is his attorney, they also provide evidence that other creators on platform create videos about bricks, and only bricks. @jur4x wait is there actually one, if there is i will get nebula via the link in the desc lmao Yes, you are correct. The Brick Facade is only 38 min and 55 sec long, not 40 minutes Damn, my boy got the unreleased Hamilton songs up in here I\\'d like to think it\\'s the interest on all that tea we dumped Josh 256m not relevant in Britain? @Josh 256m I\\'m Asian and i know that reference.... The reason why US, UK owes India $10 Trillion   https://youtu.be/ixJgY2VSct0 Makes sense. WilliamPAshworth I know what it is. But don’t expect others too. It isn’t relevant anywhere else except the US Correction it wasn\\'t our government who created the Congestion Charge it was the Mayor of London. \"It\\'s like charging people for healthcare\"\\nI got that This came up in my recommended feed..\\n\\n..of Soundcloud\\'s thiccest hiphop lyrics of 2020. Unlike Byron Russel, I enjoyed the crossover. When I saw this, I thought it  was going to be all about Parking Tickets, and it wasnt but also it was...sorta. Provided, \\'ed\\' is HAI\\'s most favourite ending of every word. Undoubted. 😂😂😂 I looked like 4:42 when I found out I have diplostatic retoonity in this comment section. 😂 Bro you on point, that SIMP tax snapchat joke genuinely had me dead \"SIMP TAX\" 😂😂😂😂 dead lol 1:28 missed out on the ohare pun there poor nations need this type of capital city driving charges to help their economy without needing to export anything The rhyming 😂😂😂 Why am I just hearing a nursery rhyme?\\n Because this is how to jump from kindergarten to high school HAI: The government funding healthcare succs\\nAlso HAI: educates us with this \"Why would London charge people to drive on its roads? That\\'s what roads are for! That would be like charging people for sunshine, or fresh air, or basic healthcare!\"\\n\\n*Laughs in American* Is no one gonna comment on the background music, it really bothers me That intro just kept going... it just kept going, \\nYou probably thought, if I was clever, I would come up with a rhyme now... and no... why i hearing sooo much \"DED\" Bro I uncontrollably laughed so hard at the \"simp tax\" part \"simp tax\"\\nOh you meant taxing dating apps?\\nWe don\\'t do that here Great vid as always, HAI! FYI, The flag you used as \"London\" is actually the flag for the City of London, 2 completley different things. Whilst the Congestion Charge is in the City of London, the majority of it is just in London. London, surprisingly enough, doesn\\'t have a flag. The UK\\'s still trying to get their $4 million from the US for their tea taxes somehow. Eminem’s been pretty quite sense that intro... The thumbnail looks like that of Chopin Institute Home Recitals’ 😂 3:42: London doesent have a flag\\nThe city of london has a flag but “the city of london” is diffrent then “london” (complicated but watch tge cgp gray video on it) \"simp tax\" lol @Gods Bloody Hammer ok👍🏻 The reason why US, UK owes India $10 Trillion   https://youtu.be/ixJgY2VSct0 So American diplomats can run people over and not pay charges All diplomats can Most diplomats in many countries I think you have to know about the history between the US and Britain to get a lot of these jokes😂😂 Lol the US really said “No ❤️” HAI: 14 dollars ain\\'t that much\\nMe with literally just enough to exist: Sure Jan Fun fact US has the largest debt about \\'21\\' trillion dollars However, around $14-$19 trillion dollars comes from the government itself. The rest is foreign debt. It\\'s not the largest as a percentage of GDP Majority of that debt is to the US government, the fed, and US investors who have bought into the bond market. @Yellow Penguin lol Actually, $26,743,153,951,328 give or take, but it\\'ll be more by the time you read this. Notification message cut off at £1. Would\\'ve been more weird imo The transitions between video and Curiosity Stream ad is always so silky smooth that I can never tell where one ends and the other begins. 😜 \"if what ICJ said actually mattered.\" Does anybody\\xa0even cares about ICJ? Yes!  Finally a reason for the UK to invade and Make America Great Britain Again! L AxxL I don’t know what’s worse: reading that or getting shot in the fucking head. The reason why US, UK owes India $10 Trillion   https://youtu.be/ixJgY2VSct0 @AxxL oh no, not this guy again @Doejaan That\\'s canon now. 3:55 Or a diplomat\\'s wife could drive like a blind badger with a learning disorder, cause a crash in which someones son dies and then piss off to America pretending that her husband\\'s diplomatic immunity covers her and so she never gets brought to justice for reckless driving and man slaughter. Cant tell you how much I loved the \"Seinfeld vs Friends\" line. Brilliant! ',\n",
       " 'The world\\'s biggest living fish is a shark. What intrigues you the most about these amazing creatures? @allan dave arranchado Whales are mammals Bdbgzffe oh i never new that The Megalodon is king of the sharks\\nit can........... Obliterate a T rex sorry if ur a dino lover. Sharks are my most favorite animal and my most favorite shark is the bull shark We gotta appreciate the people recording these sharks. nqnguyen2008 sharks aren’t likely to attack divers Orion 242 most drones arent used for recording like this, it’s most likely underwater videographers @Jorgeanne R 🤷😂😂 Jorgeanne Reyes so you have a phone number orrrrrrrrrrrr Bruce Wayne I appreciate it 😅 Most sharks: Do not come near me or i will crush your head with my terrifying jaw.\\nWhale sharks: hello pal, nice to meet you, wanna be friends? 😤😤😤😤 😆 Usually sharks only eat fish they are still nice but nice thinking lol nice to meet you where you been? i could show you incredible things (lol) @ct20101 chill yall, im talking about the appearence and it was ONLY a joke. I didnt expect that so many people would be mad at me because of a silly caricature about sharks Forgot to mention the Shark pledge: I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food. Lol \"finding nemo\" lol Aidan Rogers underrated comment Sharks are Scary but are magnificent Very true Yes they are true dat there is a word such as\\n\\'humans kill sharks more than sharks kill human\\' save the earth! Exactly! @The Spirit No your right bro, they don\\'t attack instantly on sight, most the time they\\'ll observe for a lil bit, not every shark is out to eat you as soon your spotted, they may not even be hungry, you are right because sharks are probably some of the lowest estimations to kill people a year. Yes bro there are more fish in the sea, but what I\\'m saying bro is people are eating seafood every day, but this don\\'t affect the numbers in sealife at all because the amount of times fish are getting marketed into stores, it not enough to tank the numbers and growing population of all the fish in the sea, we only fishing about 4% of the sealife outta the 96% of the rest of the ocean, and we\\'re only around the coastlines, the ocean is much larger than the land and take up like 80% of the Earth while 20% of the land, the sealife probably inevitable but you never know, maybe I might get proven wrong someday bro @Isa the Rebel but most of time they dont even  attack that much people ,   sharks are estimated to kill 6 people a year , do 100 million  sharks really attack  on sight? Though I get what your point is aren\\'t there more fish in the sea? @King Ghidorah Yes bro fair point,  but that\\'s only if we\\'re hunting, fisherman ain\\'t gonna catch every shark in the sea, like I said this go back to the food chain discussion, the dodo was hunted for a long time, the Blue Macaw is now extinct because it was constantly being hunted which caused endangerment and led to this because of the ignorance of people bro Isa the Rebel We are literally doing that.🤦🏾. People use them as medicine (which is false) creatures can definitely be hunted into extinction like the dodo. Killer whales: exists\\nGreat whites: Why do I hear boss music? ko ll @John Mairs weyhvvvf Killer whales can sing? Thanks dude 😂 I love this narrator\\'s voice. Angeli Gabriel’s voice is amazing Simp Me too @code 23Hyper ggh she kinda sounds lie siri and alexa together The gigantic beauty of ocean. Please save them. Wow, spiral -shaped shark eggs. Can\\'t be comfortable to lay those. I used to pick those eggs up off the beach all the time. Those sharks got screwed really good. You went in really deep 😜 Hi nat geo\\nInteresting details about sharks..\\n101 videos are always interesting to watch..\\nThanks for the video..🙏👍😊 Hknn Sharks : largest sea predators \\nOrcas :  hold my beer... Abishek Acharya Whale sharks and basking sharks are bigger then orcas @wil brander b @wil brander LOL Sharks never stop growing anyways. @Abishek Acharya technically not as sharks make up more of the food chain. i think human beings deserve to be extinct in order for this wonderful world to recover itself quickly. yeah including me include you? \\nI know what you wanna say, but all of us can\\'t be free from destroying of earth.\\nOur economic system can\\'t be stopped and\\xa0we are going to death slowly. Sharks are powerful and beautiful So true Dolphins They are cute but a lot of people think they kill humans and are dangerous Yup Human: shark are scary \\nAlso human: kill shark\\nMe:I think some human is more scary than shark 🤦 You forgot to mention that barnicle\\'s can\\'t stick to shark skin, and the navy has been trying to replicate this on their ships for over 50 years.\\nThey still can\\'t do this. Sharks rule all and they\\'ll continue long after we vanish from the planet. has anyone seen the movie \"the meg\" ??? @WaxthatFled lmao Shut up meg Wow that is a good thing that they are being protected Yeah I dont think it works good Is it just me or does the narrator always say “however”🤨 I never realized they had scales. Their skin looks so smooth I finally found a recent comment We must stop killing sharks. They are so peaceful- I am very sad they are dying. \\n\\nThey are biting people because they are threatened.  Also who thinks we should stop killing them.\\n\\n👇🏻 they’re also biting out of curiosity and when people cage dive and chum for them they start associating people with food It is interesting that quite a few species of sharks give birth to live young. Sharks are terrifying, but they’re so cool! Whenever I’m at the beach, I’m always kind of scared that there are sharks. (Where I live, there are seals at beaches, which also means sharks sometimes 😂) I love dolphins I love sharks lol Im here just to watch Gawr gura Live in sea. Sharks are graceful and truly misunderstood😔 Agreed thanks to steven spielberg You have to realize these beautiful creatures are dying. :( Yo DaD Along with rhinos. This is horrible. It is estimated the year 2040 they will go extinct because of how much they get killed every year All I know, is they attack us when they feel threatened. Human is the most terrifying animal who is the only reason for the lost  many species of each & every animal. Wow, sharks be participating in natural selection before they even born Oldest creatures on the planet. 400 millions years will give a race a lot of time to mix thing sup. Sharks are predators of the sea. I can\\'t forget that excitement when I watch movies or videos about sharks. I remember going to the aquarium last year to see the ironclad shark. It wasn\\'t a scary-looking shark I knew and I thought it was rather cute. I want to see sharks even in the real sea. This helps me sleep I use to be scared of sharks when I was a kid but when I got older I discovered they are awesome fish! Asian countries are over fishing, dumping giant amounts of plastic in the ocean.....uhguguuhh i kinda agree. but we are all equally responsible for all the problems other living beings are suffering. USA withdrawed from the paris agreement despite being the most developed country in the world lol. And yet whites are blaming asians again. They never mention about nebraskan wolves or dodo birds which whites led to extinction. @Christina Fernandez lol. Ur joking right? Look at your sky @Da Wootzi tbh India is also part of Asia in case you didnt realize. Btw ask Japan to stop eating sharks and whales @ItchyPilauBoto808 research it, didn\\'t say only ones, but research it To the person who narrated this video I like your voice Some casual guy: What is the most scariest animal? \\nMe: Us we kill everything Animals: do something to survive\\n\\nHumans: *WOW* Hahahah yeah so how many times we gotta tell ya Meg\\'s were thought to be 60ft not 80ft not 100ft but 60ft Sixty! I would love to film for national geographic 🤙🏻 At around 3:20 ish I got curious and wanted to look up “baby sharks” then I realized that’s not a good idea lol adrw baby shark doo do did do do dooo duu Shark : Hello hooman, want you to be my friend? \\n\\nHuman : nope, i just want your fin. \\n\\n🦈 : :\"((((((((( Who wants to eat shark fins anyway???? @MIKASA  hi It isn\\'t joke, it sarcas for people who still unloved with shark. N sea creature @Viktoriya Stogniy then don\"t respond and move on :) AS Lestari so stupid your\" humor\" crazy how you have to fight off your siblings to be born Props to all these brave cameramans When I lined my wetsuit around the arms and ankles,with neodymium magnets not shark would come 3 feet to me,even with chum in my hands,take the idea I don\\'t care,save people\\'s lives... Shark : Sry I bit u, I thought ur a seal\\nHuman : I know wut u r, and Imma not sry for killing u now\\nShark : *gulp* Did you know that the 2nd largest fish is also a shark called the basking shark DA idot Dear NatGeo,\\nat the 5:16 footage is not in Indonesia and in thus footage they are not Indonesian. Please do more careful on putting title during editing process before upload and publish it. Thanks Can you give me more information about it? Thank you ^^ *Called sax*\\n\\n\\nMe: Um o-ok... China can make all animal extinct with they \"cure\" drug Sharks 101: stay away! Speaking of Sharks,  i have a game on my Ipad called Hungry Shark Evolution and it supports Bluetooth gamepads 😉 the fact that they eat their siblings make them so much scary! just imagine in human life if we had to do that too ( SPARTA way) narrator: most sharks give birth to live young\\n\\n\\nthen a remora appears lol Narrator: Sharks have limitless teeth\\nMe: I heard there was this boy who has 200 teeth and kept on doing surgery to lose those 200 teeth @Matthew Halili correct! Jessica Soho Brothers and sisters we are united once more by youtube\\'s recommendation algorithm haha Even with all the movies that gives this beautiful creature a bad rep. I couldn\\'t and still can see the as villains Did you also know that the basking shark got its name because it swims so close to the ocean surface Looking for plankton which it got the illusion of basking in the sun Its great that this video is showing the importance and beauty of sharks instead of malinging them and spreading fear Sharks: fish is food\\nSharks from Nemo: fish are friends not food Great footage, lots of info, and a succinct summary of conservation threats all packed into a short video. Outstanding. Lmao my brother is out fishing and caught a shark.( he released it) Tiger sharks teeth are horrifying. @Stephanie S agreed, hehe. @Ja Biezel lol true. But if I had to choose I\\'d hate to get bit by that one Are any Sharks teeth Not horrifying, lol??!!?!! @Diego Manzo Yeah whatever one has the teeth going in all kinds of directions. The sand shark? Sharks protect oxygen. My Asian classmates told me they tried shark fins and enjoyed it. Really sad 0:07min  those guys balls of steel! Why are people saying sharks are scary? I\\'ve always found them cute.\\nI\\'ll be more terrified by a clown tbh Yo DaD no not that type of clown XD Michael Ragusa you’re scared of Alex wassabi? I hate clowns I get scared when I see one coming to me I dont f****** understand why people disliking this video!!!! Attention seekers Some people just hate sharks and want them to be gone thinking that it will be better for humans. Here in the Philippines that large shark is called \"butanding\" 😁😄 Hi, the documentary is amazing, can I use part of this video for non-commercial used video? Thank you for making these videos~I\\'m getting more information about sharks and I got a dream called biologist!! *Megalodon could’ve reached 80 feet long and weighted 70 tons*\\n\\nWell that’s debatable. It couldn’t have grown bigger than 57-60 feet and probably weighed maybe 50 tons at most. That would make it the same size as Livyatan and the same size as an average sperm whale and smaller than the biggest sperm whales @Ash Price that\\'s the medium size @Eren jeager 50 feet* Megalodon is 20 meters long and 60 tons but maybe it could grow up more 🤔 Wow! I was very interested in this video when it was shown in my online classes 4:09 is DEFINITLY NOT BALI, you can see a flag and it\\'s not an Indonesian flag. @GitarrenJonny I know bruh I\\'m Indonesian myself. What I\\'m saying is the flag is not Indonesian flag therefore thats definitly not Bali. Zincelec Bali is part of Indonesia 🤦🏼\\u200d♂️ The fact that people cut off sharks fins off is so sad, I’m glad their being protected. I maybe scared of sharks but I would never in my life would grab a shark out of the water and cut off its fin! That’s just cruel. 3:06 let\\'s kill this love Sharks are so underrated.  Remember when kids had that shark/dinosaur/lion phase???  BRING IT BACK animals are so freaking cool Johanna Chesshir I still love sharks and Dinosaurs, Lions are cool tho. only watching this to get over my fear of sharks lmao Shoutout to Ms McLeod the best marine science teacher Yeah Shark week @National Geographic please do dolphins 101 Seen on television,\\nWhat The Shark? \\nSharks dominante the oceans before the dinosaurus.\\nOne thing,\\nThere is no shark that dares to approach a killer whale! How would a hard-bone shark weigh that much more than a cartilage shark when they are neutrally buoyant in water?  If they stop swimming, they will slowly sink, but a small bladder would be all that is needed (as for a marlin).  I held up a 500# shark in waist-deep water with ease, but I could have never lifted him out of the water.  Just curious. 🤔 I think no one eats Shark Fins in India? they eat roti with anything in balti Evey creature made for the reasons with so many capacity to live in, thanks for crater OMG IS VERY VERY IMPRECIONANT OMGGG aah, what a refreshing video! 1:28 is that the shark equivalent of milk coming out of your nose? Please dont kill sharks. Love nature Wildlife SRILANKA!!!! @wildlifepremium We have a million sustainable foods yet humans still need to fish until extinction. Good on you! Like Agent Smith said in the Matrix...humans are a virus. SHARKS ???!! SOUNDS LIKE A BIG FISH STORY TO ME NATGEO. ... LOL 😂 This is my 4th grade teacher seriously Given the importance of such an institution like National Geographic, with it\\'s world-wide name recognition... Is it to much to ask for the metric system in your scientific videos? Thank you very much. Yes and they\\'re being hunted to extinction by both accident and on purpose, mostly for their fins. We have to help save them not endanger them. Because they help the sea to not be over populated Liliana C why? If we can control the populations of other fish why are sharks important? Sharks are one of my favorite creatures I\\'ve seen a real whale shark in Osaka (Japan) Sharks teeth remind me of a full magazine in a gun. Lose a couple to kill something. Reload and repeat lol I love it V.nice  -\\nSuper ,\\nThanks for Video. See I told u I was lying ',\n",

Then he compliments him a few times, talks about how he’s not allowed on Ems radio station?\\nYou got to realise em has been doing this for 20 years and to only come up with that is incredibly weak \\nIt was clear em had more thought to this than kells did even the title killshot is incredibly clever because \"Killshot\" is a film in which the Targets of a murder are the Colson family, and what’s kells real name? Colson. - so think about that for a second. Eminem has so many hidden meanings in his raps that every single one of his lines can be translated into a paragraph.\\nDon’t confuse the beat and overall catchiness of the songs as one being better than the other, this is a rap battle, not a Christmas jingle.\\nEminem disses had much more off an impact than kells did and hit much harder and plus mgk stated that he had another diss ready for ems diss why not release it? He said he could kill eminem if it had been released so why not after killshot was released kells had soo much hate and was constantly being told that he lost so if he gad a oppertunity to destroy em why didnt he.\\nBut at the end of the day i tip my hat off for mgk his doing incredibly well rn and im a huge fan off his but just because his song is more catchy and sonically sounds better dosent mean he won. @Kershaw Tha savage mgk complimented eminem half the track and also what did he really say that was an effective diss?

       " 'Thanks to the can and his wonderful work.please take care of that microphone you are using let all put on masks when using it to avoid contamination through saliva to the mick Thank you KTN for your consistency in your updates on you tube! \\n\\nThank you, Meble following from Kasikeu DIY hand sanitizer idea to fight covid19\\r\\n👇👇👇\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/XX4sSE_u1Qc  ✍✍✍🙋 Instead of buying more masks and give out freely...you bought many body bags..Village need food n water We don\\'t have enough PPE in hospitals as well Magoha tells us those who are not accessing online education what should they do Mtasikia ugonjwa kesho imepotea hehehe, sio kwa ubaya lakini mimi huwa siamini serikali. Korona ipotee kwa Imani na hayo ndio maombi yetu kila mara.  Mungu yuko nasi 😂😂 Thank you Prof. Magoha for using the mask correctly and insisting that others do the same!! Charge any reporters not wearing a mask. We have video evidence. About mass testing i prefer they do just like general voting have people with some civic education going round testing and still being sensitive about life Mr Cs please be an example to kenyans .wear your mask even when updating us.corona is not your friend confirm copied ..... And kenyans watch other international news. To learn whats is going . Dont be vixed on home news only. We arr doomed. Hiki Government haiwafikirii wanyonge haki. Sijui kama wanajua kunabadhi ya wanafunzi mashambani wazazi wao hawana radio au simu mbali na laptops???. Mimi haki sielewi maana ya: \"They have a history of Traveling\". Sasa history of training ya mwaka gani na saa hii hakuna usafiri wowote??? Ama bado wanasafiri??? I think they had travelled, self quarantined and still things were not negative for them. This press lady is given audience without masks in a public place allowed to address Kenyans in broad daylight breaking the law?\\nShe ought to have been denied the chance to ask questions and get arrested and charged to be a lesson.\\nThe press are advancing gvt regulations to Kenyans and are doing the opposite and above all even The cs for health himself is  not on mask.Hon Kagwe remember we learn from you as u speak.\\nKudos Prof Magoha for taking note of that \\nLet\\'s all be serious. @ANITA GATHONI Kwani  magoha ameadress aje? Wasn\\'t his mouth covered? Ignorance leads to failure! They should walk the talk. How do you ask questions with mouth covered??? Remember minister u hv forgot to wear masks $ also remember ur the first one to show those samples,whe is ur masks ahead minister charity begging at home. This guy \\'mutahi\\' is more audible, coherent, articulate and you get more anxious to hear whatever he is addressing than the other lady who sometimes give the update.The lady is boring when giving update. Thank you Mr. Kagwe for giving us hopes in line with cautions and responsibility. I wonder how people \"say that if get a job in the government i will help people and do justice\"...but once someone gets that job he is ambushed with fear and all he thinks of is his stomach and the stomach of his family. These people here have the ability to talk on how those people who dont have jobs for now how do they get help from the government? Ubaya yenyu hamtoi hesabu ya wale wlipona na wale walikufa, bado mnaongezea tu hesabu Listen to Dane Callaway on this topic 🙏🏼🙏🏼 How about casuals in Industrial area? 😔😔scared and sad How are pubs been monitored? Nani huyo wakuvalia mask kwa shingo kama scarf  ya kukinga baridi?😂😂... \\nHaya maisha ya korona jo... ishindwe kwa damu ya Yesu Chtisto Where is your mask Mr. Kagwe. Please give Kenyans hope on this platform. I\\'m beginning not to like watching you because its too much doom. I mean pls don\\'t despair. Old don\\'t despair. Nothing lasts forever. All this will be history. ,don\\'t  be partacy Jefferson These journalists are too close.... Do they have ears really? I want to address this particular media station for airing particular transmission s that showed barbaric killings of  domestic animals in so called cultural documentaries ,over the Easter season!!!!!!\\nWhat happened to the requirements of prior warnings to sensitive people or the young, within the watershed hours.......!!!!!!\\nAll media houses should be ordered to do so as a matter of safeguards to mental health of us all, !!!!\\nMany members of my family now need therapy over this \\nAct on this immediately I\\n, failure to which I will sue whoever puts me through this ever again!!!!!!!! DIY hand sanitizer idea to fight covid19\\r\\n👇👇👇\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/XX4sSE_u1Qc  ✍✍✍🙋 Online studies Kenya imeendelea .....wewe Sawa tumewaelewa lkn kumbukeni taifa la kesho ni vijana wasome kwa bidii wakikaa sana watapoteza memory wengine hawana uwezo huwo mnao sema kuwaelewa tumewaelewa.lkn hamtembei kuona majanja ya maisha ya watu uko vijijini mnaona tu yakaribu yenu mkiona hivyo ndio hilivyo.tembeheni mjione vijijini acheni urban area.😭😭😭😭 This is not my real name.  Hon CS you are doing a good job keep up. Please assist me here. I work in one of the Ministries (NOT one of those that are offers what we would call critical services at the moment like security or medical services) and I happen to have a pre-existing medical condition. According to the recent government directives such a person should either work at home or take leave because the immunity is compromised. I applied for leave soon after this announcement  by the president but my immediate boss told me he cannot approve such leave. So what I do and why are some people violating such directives? As I write this comment am in the office. I feel so bad because I know am risking my health and the same time being \"forced\" to violate one of the government directive.s. Please help. Just make your boss understand humbly ur situation. In case he refuses ask him whether you can work from home and give you assignment CS Kagwe, this is not the time to self praise and send praises to the President. He was not doing anything extraordinary, other than the call of his duty as president. It’s also not civil o sugar coat Raila’s mistake in sending the food donations contributed by BIDCO, KAPA, Wanjigi and others to Kibra where he knew very well the poverty levels are very high and the foods were nothing much compared to their needs. Prof. Maghoha is quickly getting into the system of deceit and lies. Honestly, many children from the poor communities are not in a position to get online education. There is no mechanisms that is currently addressing this economic disparities. Truth be told, Prof. Maghoha, you have lied to Kenyans on this count. On the mask issues, CS Kagwe is guilty of ignoring his own call for use of masks. His mask is now like a note book, he carries and places on the podium as he talks. That Mandera Governor, has a mask but it’s hanging on his chin like a neck lace. Similarly, CS Mucheru comes to the microphone and then drop off his mask like a neck lace. This is a show of how the cabinet is not adhering to the corona protection protocol. How do they expect the public to behave when they see you guys being delinquent? Forget to add this point why can\\'t Kenyan government not provide for people who lost their jobs and they are always paying taxes where does the taxpayer money go if they can\\'t help poor Kenyans at this trying difficult time, every other country is doing it . Wear mask that microphone is already contaminated too much spitting on it. Right on bro...Absolutely truthful! ',\n",

Thank you so much and you too Thank u Agreed After loosing my dad to a brain illness and later Scuicide,I have not been able to sleep. I\\'m horrible in school and always so tired and drag myself along. Then, we had an earthquake (in Alaska) and my entire school just collapsed. A desk fell on my a nearly crushed my spine. I felt like I was going to die. Everyone was screaming and crying and wanting to get out of this living nightmare. I was scared, but I was ready to die. I didn\\'t want to solve the problems like my dad did, by taking my own life. I couldn\\'t do it to my mom or to my pets, friends, and family. As I laid there on the ground, every thing not blurry and foggy and I saw a man- very similar looking to my father- standing there. As he got closer I realized it was him and he helped me up and bandaged my cuts, scrapes, and brusises. I was crying. I had missed him and hugged him, until he faded and I woke up, free on the collapsed desk on my bad and bandaged up. I haven\\'t seen him since but I know wherever he is, my dad is safe with the Lord.💛💛💛 i love this you truly are amazing and your father is looking down on you so proud of what an amazing person you became, keep everything up we have our ups and downs but their isn’t anything the lord can’t heal with a prayer if you ever are feeling down or anything feel free to try and get in touch with me and we’ll pray together Remember no one is perfect but God and Lord is\\r\\nNo one is more beautiful than nature .He is always with you in a every point of life. \\r\\nThere is so much pain in life...but u have to face every battle of life with a huge smile.

And his daughter (who had a really bad life) she had to move from one house to the other and she kept switching so she got so sick of it she cut hers left first and then committed suicide in my step aunts house by hanging.

Picture yourself doing what you want to do, what you want to have. Let\\'s make this beautiful planet full positive thoughts! Positive minds. God bless everyone 🙏.  We are thoughts (souls) our bodies are here temporary. Sending positive vibes everyone. You need emotions to do that lol. 🙏🏽thank you ImSoH1gh1 the world is cursed by the fallen and evil lurks everywhere.. yesGod allows things to happen and he only knows the answer why our job is to just trust him. Religion is man made doctrine built ion scare tactics and lies. God gave his only son so that we could have a relationship with him. Seek and you’ll find. Ask and the answer will be revealed to you. Don’t lose hope or faith.. reach out one more time. Take care Amen brother. Gotta stay positive and keep your head up. Thank you.... Worrying is like a rocking chair. You can go back and forth all day but your still gonna be in the same place you began. Oh my god that is so true I get anxiety when i take tests worried facts but corona got me wooried and stressed and tense Guys he got that from National Lampoon\\'s Van Wilder movie he’s not fucking mark twain In the midst of all the outbreak, shelter in place news...I still have faith that everything is going to be okay. There\\'s so much negativity out there...lets do a collective positive vibes...sending good thoughts to everyone out there...The universe has our back! Everything is going to be fine lots of love is here and everywhere..hugs and love to you and all here For anyone going through major anxiety and not able to sleep, I fully recommend Sleepytime Extra tea. Get a good size mug and put 2 bags of the herbs in there. After drinking it hot, wait about 30 minutes. It helps reduce anxiety, reduce high blood pressure, and helps you relax overall. I definitely recommend. You\\'re not alone guys! I am suffering anxiety and depersonalisation it scares me but thanks for the suggestion The pandemic has brought me here. May god be with us all. ❤️ This is the awakening. 2020 is the year of global  consciousness. Never let the media scare you it\\'s meant to block our awareness  of now. We are all connected to eachother  and the universe. Weather u believe  in God or source  just know we are all one and will be most powerful  when we act as one. Love everyone  live  as if they are you and you them. Focus  on your inner continuous channel you energy into prosperity  and growth in mind,body,and soul. Receive  what u desire as if you already  have it feel the emotions  in your heart  as if its already  there. Because  it is source and the unlimited  power is always  in us. Channel it feel it and spread the word of positivity  and law of attraction. Knowledge  is meaningless if it is not shared\\n Love you all and may we all prosper and grow together  as one just like the great ones before us.this material  world means nothing focus on grasping the real thought that is you and dont listen to the negative  voice in your head. stay aware in the now that is key we run on autopilot  99 percent  of the day. Take time to meditate  think what you want right now and receive it as if it already  here. and may we all meet in the 4th dimension as well as in the present by way of oneness.and always remember you source that is the soul inside you has unlimited  power never percieve  loss of energy for you are limitless. Peace and love to us all. nice to see all these comments so positive and friendly with eachother wish the whole world could just be this way. Sereisly!? Well pepole dont want to make other pepole mad😇 E ME TOO 👁👄👁 Life isn\\'t always easy. I hope whatever you\\'re currently going through has a solution and you get past whatever is bothering you.

This one is a keeper. To quote John Lennon \"Everything will be OK in the end, if everything isn\\'t OK, it\\'s not that end\" hope this helps anyone who needs it Thanks for this🔴🍒 Came here after having a mental breakdown over a math exam review packet, it’s done after 3 hours now 👍 we are all here for one purpose in life and only one purpose \\nthe purpose is to serve god,\\nso what ever you go trough take a deep breath and think that you are now in a place where God wants u to be \\nhe is with u going trough this rough times and he also has a end to it \\nanother perspective is that he doesn\\'t give challenges to a person only if he can take it \\nso relax u have the strength to push it trough,\\none day you will shine, there is always a end to every dark tunnel \\ni\\'m writing this in one of my toughest times Seek God. Pray, conversate with him, Jesus got me out of my depression. Give yourself a chance to believe in something greater than yourself Yess you are right!! I am a Muslim and Allah got me out of my depression La La La policía un La policía \\nEl presidente Beneficencia Look, if you feel like your life is going \"back\", imagine it like a bow, and you are the arrow. The life will pull you back, but you will get a great launch and be sucsessfull. If you are in (high)school, and you, for example have a project, don\\'t stress and just \"explode\", don\\'t eve think in the future, because it will seem really, really complicated. The easiest thing is to give up, but don\\'t, because that\\'s the bow and arrow. The point in life, like many others, is to not give up, don\\'t stress and don\\'t give up up on your dreams. I\\'m just 15, and I go in a constructional technicial high, and feel like I\\'ll blow. I have to do 3 projects because I injured my ligament really bad, and had to skip school. All the stuff sumed up and I had to do it. But never forget, you aren\\'t alone ❤ don\\'t stress and don\\'t give up 💪🏻, and forget your past (if it is painfull) because that will pull you back, but not in a good way. I love all of you❤, have a great time, travel cuz the money will come back, but your time won\\'t, go say I love you to your parents, grandparents, and spend some quality time together. Good night/morning to all of you❤ So much anger, hatred and violence from the protests and riots all around the world. I pray that people see the light and learn to let go of what angers them, what makes them dread living, what makes them terribly depressed. Hatred is a disease. The only cure for it is relief and happiness one can receive from listening to videos like this. God bless you all and thank you for reading. For anyone recently watching I wanna let u know that u got this okay. Wether u say u can or can’t u are right. So think positive and focus u got this These are trying times😔\\nThese are the days the bible was talking about\\nWe are in the last days\\nPrepare for his return \\nStay safe out there✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 The ppl in this comment section r beautiful.

I have been dealing with this for only a week and I’m miserable so I can ONLY imagine how some of you chronic sufferers must feel. I hope we can all achieve some comfort for this soon. I wish you all the best! I’m sorry you’re in a hard place right now. ❤️ I have Bipolar Disorder, and it can be quite a journey. One thing I have learned is the complete truth of the saying, “This too shall pass.”  What you are feeling right now will not last forever. Brightness will come again. Hang on tight until it does. May you be blessed! I am healing and it really hurts, we may feel hopeless but good thing is god will show us a way. He will heal you soon. Believe in god. Sending kind regards your way.\\n\\nI know how you feel, two years ago my whole world crumbled to the floor in one day.

I lost a friend a few weeks ago and that has made me feel depressed and stressed because he used to be the best and made me feel stable. God bless everyone. Eric Hernandez-Mejias- time heals. But always focus on school. I wish I would’ve taken it more seriously. I really hope you’re okay, my boyfriend’s mom passed away and it really affected me mentally, I write letters for her here and there just to let things out.  She was like my mom after 3 years.

Thank you 😊 Can someone give me some advice\\n\\nMy anxiety is this, everytime i close my eyes my mind thinks that there is an earthquake. My feet started to chill and my heart beats faster and im sweating. Having hard time sleeping. Sometimes, i am over reacting. Even its just a normal chest pain, my mind goes crazy thinking that its a covid. I am over thinking. I been drinking all night just get some sleep but it becomes worst. Ive been an alchocol dependent just to get through this. This day is the worst, im lack of sleep and i need to work.  During my break i tried to get some sleep and look for anxiety meditation and i found this. I got some sleep while listening to his voice even its just a couple of minutes. I found a relief. I hope that i can overcome my anxiety from this day on. Help me god I have narcalepsy. This really helps me to sleep with  less frequent interrupted sleep patterns at night. I wake up in a good mood instead of groggy, tired and  confused. When I awake in the middle of the night, I hear the music and fall back to sleep. Thanks.... I\\'m trying to let someone go...

If you are then school has failed you. @skullking119 Eh?  You have to be insane if you believe that.  Scotland has punched above its weight in Union since 1707. It’s funny how some Scots think the UK would be better if being ruled by then when we’ve already seen the UK under Scottish rule . Gordon Brown was the PM of the UK and he is SCOTTISH if you take a look at the state of the UK during his time you can see he didn’t do a very good job .\\n\\nWhether the UK is better under Scottish or English leadership depends on the leader . @Mathew Wells- If you’re talking about Charles the first he actually did visit Scotland . The Scots and English have been attacking each other since at least the battle of Brunanburh but I think the Anglo Saxons and Scots fought each before England and Scotland even EXISTED as independent countries . \\n\\nDon’t do the typical Scottish nationalist thing where you believe the English are the evil invaders and act like the Scots have never done the same because if you actually look at history you can see that the Scots have invaded England just as many times as England has invaded Scotland . 5:20 that translates to \"France has entered the cat\" :p\\n\"Tchat\" is French for chat, and \"chat\" is French for cat.

Unimpressed knight does not care for your empire. Da Red Gobbo ☝️☝️ Unimpressed longbowman puts up his archery fingers There’s a cool semi-historical show called “The Last Kingdom” about wessex in the viking century. It’s getting a fourth season soon (26April) and it’s amazing. Really recommend if you like that era. I wouldn\\'t call that semi-historical as it pretty much bastardises history... Thank you for this! Since seeing this comment I am now hooked on Last Kingdom First 2 seasons on BBC were great but I think it went downhill when Netflix picked it up. @Telsion lol, true, but I would point out how that show is much more clearly basing itself in the sagas, which blur history and myth. While I am not sure where they pull the last kingdoms history from it does seem to try using real history more, which is why I poke fun at it when it gets stuff wrong.\\n\\nAll that said the shield thing is just that way for the audience members who are not familiar enough with the period to readily tell the difference between a Norse viking and Anglo-Saxon warrior. Which, I get. Still gonna make fun though. @csec95 it is still a whole lot better than Vikings Could we get History Summarized: Wales please? Yes, I want blue getting his tongue a crash course in gymnastics because of the pronunciation HAHAHAHA Dwi\\'n cytuno! “I don’t care about kings. Royal gymnastics is boring”.\\nI’m glad we disagree on something. @Nikhil Iyengar Some of us don\\'t care about genealogies. I\\'m more into individual battles and the cultures behind it. I care not a whiff about most of the \"major players\" instead caring about the plays. They still matter when you go into detail about the chain of events, but I\\'m a micro guy. Always been more impressed by stutter steps than massing units. I also disagree with the notion that these conflicts were unimportant, or can be safely ignored when attempting to truly understand the development of Britain/England as a state. Summaries are useful heuristics when introducing a topic for a ten minute video, but not for expounding on that topic in detail. I\\'m honestly surprised that a medieval history enthusiast can be uninterested in conflicts between kings and civil wars, because that\\'s basically the grill in the burger for me. To each his own, I guess. \"the surprise guest appearance of plague\"\\n\\n\\nI can relate Corona Yup, true dat. We can learn from history all we can, but it repeats itself anyway.\\nAlso, I made your 666th Like of your comment.\\n\\\\m/ nowadays... We can all relate these days! Hey! Think on the bright side, the last four generations (us included) had to go through history classes not understanding the depth of a plague, kids now will ask how long the soldiers stayed in quarantgine and what games the played inside their tents! I\\'m actually a little disappointed that Alfred the Great didn\\'t get a name drop, just \"the King of Wessex.\" While I know it\\'s a summary, not even mentioning Alfred in a history of England is like leaving Julius Caesar out of a discussion about the Roman Empire. Sure, he was never technically King of England, but he laid the groundwork and set a gold standard for every single English King that came after him. @freakymoejoe2 It\\'ll probably play out in a boring game with an extremely loose grasp of history and a stupid time travel story nobody cares about, like every Assassin\\'s Creed. I wonder how that\\'s gonna play out in the next assasin\\'s creed, where Alfred is like the main antagonist. Very true. But we come here for the pretty pictures, high production value and funny goofs. He quite literally covers centuries of history in 10 minutes, its hard to expect much in the way of complexity and completeness.

Very handy, and I can now rattle all the kings and queens off the top of my head, in order. With a little context about each one. Technically it doesn’t stop with James I, as Great Britain didn’t come into being until the Act of Union in 1707, a good *century* after you stopped. So you’ve gone and skipped over the Stuart dynasty and all of the juicy bits like the colonization of the Americas and the English Civil War.

But now that I\\'ve been told the political side of things it makes a lot more sense. @Nahele Shiriki search for the \"Darien scheme\" One of the major reasons for Scotland joining the union is all the money they lost trying to found their own new world colony and the English agreeing to wipe the entire sottish national debt and stabilise the economy with a large cash subsidy. @Dan Ghostman Ohhh, makes sense.

Churchill actually resigned from government and served on the Western Front as an officer after he blamed himself for Gallipoli.\\nThe Treaty of Versaille didn\\'t \"persecute the Germans\" it crippled them economically and militarily so they couldn\\'t cause another conflict like what was seen on the Western and Eastern fronts in WWI.

I’m not gonna say that they didn’t do anything bad, because they have. But, that said, SO HAS EVERYBODY ELSE. England wasn’t alone in warring with its neighbours, England wasn’t alone in colonising, England wasn’t alone in participating in the slave trade – both Spain and Portugal were involved in the Transatlantic Slave Trade for a full century before England even got involved. The world of the past was a very messy and violent place, England isn’t an exception to that nature.\\r\\nWith this said I do want to correct you on a few things, because it is clear that you don’t really have much of an understanding with a lot of England’s history.\\r\\n1)\\tThe Annexation of Wales was not illegal – it occurred as a result of the Laws in Wales Acts of 1535 and 1542. Wales had been conquered by the Normans and the Plantagenets throughout a period beginning in 1071 and 1283 – by 1525 Wales had been under English rule for 250 years. Saying that it was illegal for a country to enact a law over territory which it has ruled for two and a half centuries is just plain ludicrous.\\r\\n\\r\\n2)\\tThe Hundred Years War was a succession crisis, England – through its King Edward III – had as much a claim to the French throne than the King of France, King Philip VI, had. Edward III’s mother was Isabella Capet, the so-called She-Wolf of France. Isabella was the daughter of King Philip IV of France, known as Philip the Fair / Philip the Iron King. In 1328 Charles IV, the son of Philip IV and brother to Isabella, died. As a result of House Capet, a family which had ruled France since 987, was now extinct in the male line. As the result of the French law of succession barring women from ruling France, the French crown passed to Philip of Valois, a distant cousin to Charles IV. Edward III, being the nephew of Charles IV and the grandson of Philip the Fair, believed that the throne should pass to him through his mother – but, as can be expected, a large chunk of France didn’t want an English king. So the war began. Saying that England had no claim to France during the Hundred Years War just goes to show how little you know about the topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n3)\\tEngland, as much as it will piss off the Irish, had a claim to Ireland. This claim was the Laudabiliter – it was a papal bull issued in 1155 by Pope Adrian IV which named King Henry II the Lord of Ireland and granted him the right to conquer and govern the isle in the name of the Catholic Church. In return for being awarded the divine right to rule Ireland it was Henry II’s duty to enforce the Gregorian reforms in Ireland and oversee the transition of Christianity in Ireland from Insular Christianity to Catholicism. Though the English did take Ireland from the Irish, it is important to understand that within the context in-which this occurred the King of England had a right to rule Ireland, a right given to him by God.\\r\\n\\r\\n4)\\tSaying that the American Revolution was the result of too much tax just goes to show how much you’ve bought into American patriotic propaganda. Though tax was a large factor in the revolution, the core of the revolution’s occurrence was Parliament’s unwillingness to give up the powers it had usurped from the Crown as a result of the Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. Yes, Britian did tax the American colonists… but this taxation was incredibly light, especially when compared to the taxation in Britain, and had only been enacted in order to pay for the immense costs of the French and Indian Wars – a conflict that American colonists had started by ignoring French colonial borders in the Ohio Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\n5)\\tThe concentration camps of the Boer War were an atrocity yes, but I want to make it clear that these camps were nothing like the camps used by the National Socialists during the Second World War nor were they like the Gulags of the Soviet Union. These camps began as refugee camps to house those that had been forced to abandon their homes as a result of the war. The camps then turned became internment camps to house Boers that had been removed from their homes as a result of the Boer adoption of guerrilla warfare. The mass death and suffering that occurred in these camps were not intentional actions on behalf of the British government to eradicate the Boer people – they were instead the result of mismanagement and corruption.\\r\\n\\r\\n6)\\tTrench Warfare in the First World War was atrocious and horrifying but, unfortunately, this was the way that the conflict was fought and there was no other means to fight it once it took hold. Blaming the tacts involved in Trench Warfare on Britain or on Churchill for that matter is just plain idiotic – especially since Churchill spent a quarter of the war fighting as a soldier on the frontlines after the failure of the Dardanelles campaign – he then spent the rest of the war as the Minister of Munitions, a position which had no authority over the conduct of the war. The thing about Trench Warfare you need to understand is that there is only one way to dislodge an enemy from a fortified position – a full frontal assault. \\r\\n\\r\\n7)\\tGermany was punished in the First World War not as an act of hypocrisy, but rather, as an act of cementing a new way of conducting international and imperial relations. Starting with the fall of Napoleon in 1815 Britain and the powers of Europe had been exercising the Congress System – also known as the Concert of Europe – to resolve disputes without coming to devastating war. This was why we saw an immense council to determine the borders of Africa during the Scramble for Africa, so as to avoid decades of colonial warfare, and it was also why we saw coalition action between the UK, France, Austria, and the Ottomans against Russia in the Crimean War. Germany was being punished for ignoring the Congress System and going to direct war – as well as breaking numerous treaties, such as the Treaty of London which affirmed Belgian neutrality and protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n8)\\tWhile the Shoot-to-Kill policy in the Troubles is another example of atrocities committed by Britain I don’t think that referring to the Military Reaction Force as ‘death squads’ is justified. You have to remember that Northern Ireland was a practical warzone as a result of violent religious and nationalistic elements.

Let me tell you this one really irked me. I later came to figure out that the national consensus is that the answer is \\'Slavery\\'. But that it is a southern political belief even throughout the Civil War that the reason was \\'States Rights\\', and that\\'s what is taught in the curriculum to this day. When I got to College I got this question wrong on an exam as it was already ingrained in my brain from middle school, and didn\\'t bother to relearn or recognize the discrepancy. I pleaded with my professor that it was what I was taught, but he didn\\'t care. You can bet I\\'ll never forget it again. Rich McGee NubGaming In Athletics/American Football they made us pray before every game. In College I took Archeology and I am not joking when I say on the first day of class a girl raised her hand once we started talking about Human Evolution and early Hominids and expressed her belief in Creationism to the professor and the class. How she doesn’t believe in evolution and that the Earth could not possibly be that old. She then went on to ask if she could omit questions on the exam if they contradicted her beliefs. Everyone was dumbfounded. I think she wanted an Easy A and took the class then realized it contradicted Everything she believed in. I don’t know What she expected in an *ARCHEOLOGY* Class! Tony Meza I don’t remember but I do believe they kinda avoided that part. I do know not much was talked about slavery. In my town there were a lot of people who bought into the states rights argument. NubGaming Hey I’m Texan too class of 2014. Im right there with you. Just curious, what did they teach you “Was the major cause of the Civil War?” States Rights or Slavery? Yes Never apologize, Blue.\\nHistorical economics is not only fascinating but incredibly useful for understanding how and why societies changed over time. Me: Finally another video without the virus\\n\\nBlue: \"Plague...\"\\n\\nOf course! ...Welsh history next? I\\'m dying, I know too much about England after this afbjjsbjhsdf I’m fascinated by language, I’d love for someone to be a video like this but also inserting when the language changed from old English, to Middle English to late Middle to modern There is actually a new, but not widely excepted, theory out there that middle English is not actually derived from old English, but old Norse. I don\\'t personally support that theory though, but the fact it exists says a lot about how much English as a language has changed from the one the Angles and Saxons spoke. Mind this is all approximate and even old English changed in its time, though not because it got any celtic or latin in it, English wouldn\\'t really start taking in a lot of loan words and such until the Viking age. There are actually more old Norse and Norman French words in modern English than old English ones, which is why the change to middle English starts after the Norman invasion. It is the language changing to reflect its changed structure and vocabulary from the proceeding 200 years of interaction with the Danes and Norwegians and also the recent arrival of the French ruling class. language change is gradual so no dates are concrete, old English was spoken from the time of the saxon migrations in the 5th to 6th centuries to about the 12th century, then middle English was spoken in the time frame of 13th to the late 15th century. After that you will start to be able to kind of read the language as early modern English. suppose you have to do Wales next, since you got the other parts of the region. the phonology will be delightful. 3:35 Blue, that\\'s a damned lie and you know it is. Aethelstan and every king until John in the 13th century styled himself \"King of the English\", \"Rex Anglorum\" in Latin. Not \"King of England\". A subtle but important distinction as the former suggests rulership over an ethnic and linguistic group whereas as the latter suggests rulership over clearly defined territory Me: still waiting for an history of italy episode.\\nBlue: hates early modern european history.\\nMe: guess i will get it served in pieces.\\nEDIT: Please blue there are people out there that think sardinia unified italy, not Sardinia-Piedmont but just SARDINIA. Me who focused on early modern England in my undergrad: “Awwwwwww!” 6:03 Wait, is that a Bill Wurtz reference?\\nHell yeah, now we got business. Last time I was this early, people were arranging stone pillars in a weird circle in Wiltshire if i remember correctly, the War of the Roses was actually fought using a children’s card game. And Henry Tudor had a REALLY crazy hairstyle. And the house of York was really nuts about white dragons with blue eyes. \"names are hard\" thats only going to get more true when you get round to tackling history of the remaining country in the British isles for this series ;) That said the story of Wales is fascinating and rarely told even within Wales itself so I look forward to if/when that video materialises :P \"Names are Hard\"\\n0 seconds in and I feel called out. \"pick one, names or years\" me, doing a panakin anakin over choices, forgets both \"shoot\"\\nNo names, no numbers\\nBut I sure can remember every Pokémon!\\nMy head has poor priorities You know, when he first said that, I thought he was referring to the really brain-melting way the Saxons named places. Æthelberht feels called out and would like to know your location. Hey hello yes mmhhmm yes I do exist yup thank you very much oh okay then bye. Would love to see a video dedicated to Wales. It\\'s sad that they are always over looked :( When blue talked about the Tudor dynasty, and mentioned henry the 8th, immediately I thought of six the musical 8:58 Henry really do be time travelling 6:01 Bill Wurtz, a man of culture 6:34 I love the fact that at least America recognizes the Magna Carta as the important document that it is. If I remember correctly it was consulted when the Thirteen Colonies got sick of Britain\\'s [expletive] and when the US Constitution written, so it gets taught about as part of American history in US schools and museums. Hell, the Magna Carta Memorial in the UK, England, was commissioned and paid for by the American Bar Association. I studied history for both my GCSE\\'s and A-Levels in England and I didn\\'t learn about this until my now ex American girlfriend told me... When I was 25... Until then, I just thought of it as a throwaway peace treaty used to solve a squabble between the crown and the nobles of the time and had some modern use in the UK\\'s Parliament, which is a horrible disservice to it\\'s historical importance.\\n\\nEdit: Spelling and grammar “Look at the bigger picture! Details don’t matter!”\\n* blinks in A-Level History Student *  I’m sorry what- \"sigh\" again Blue just skips over the actually interesting monarchical stuff. Damnit Blue I know it\\'s your channel but we wanna hear these things, SUFFER FOR OUR AMUSEMENT! Probably why he won\\'t cover the Habsburgs lets just hope he brings up the glorious revolution in part 2 \"you can tell this is an OSP video when i run away at the slightest appearance of early modern europe\"\\n\\ncool cool,  so when are you planning the \\'what caused WW2\\' video? \"Sometimes friendly, sometimes stabby\" how i think ceasar thought of his friends @Robert Hall I dont like that one that much, I think they should take another stab at it Garret LeBuis that’s my new favorite Roman joke now. @That random guy \\n\\nHe may not have been the sharpest knife in the kitchen, hence his friends loaning him theirs. @Blazorbust i guess he wasn\\'t as sharp minded as he thought he was To be fair, that was pretty knaive of him. 2:40 “Northumbria can have a little Golden Age. As a treat.” *offscreen whirring as Thatcher spins in her grave* Sooo... uh, claiming that Great Britain started as a thing with James I is kinda... wrong.he was king of both nations, sure, but as you’ve pointed out, kings sometimes don’t matter, and Scotland and England would continue to be very different things for another century, when the Act of Union 1707 made Great Britain a thing under Anne. Hell, they even fought the Civil Wars against each other! This merely re-enforces my belief that the yanks fear monarchs. Since you\\'ve done Ireland, Scotland, and now England, there\\'s only one place to go, riiiiiight?\\n\\nIt\\'s not like it\\'d take long, Wales got yoinked by England disappointingly early... He could continue to recent Wales, like during the strikes or when Thatcher stole the milk. Actually , it took the English a long time to conquer Wales because they had do deal with the vikings . The Normans were the ones who started the conquest of Wales . Although there is a hilarious history story, albeit probably apocryphal, that when the Welsh nobles requested that Edward I name a Welshman as the Prince of Wales Edward I promised \"The next Prince of Wales will have been born in Wales and speak no word of English.\" Then proceeded to name his infant son, who was born in Carnarvon castle, as the new Prince of Wales. Thus the tradition that the heir to the English throne holds the title Prince of Wales was born \"Heck.\"\\n- Definitely Caesar. \"I run away at the slightest hint of early-modern europe...\" oh, you mean the beginning of actual European  history? “Sometimes friendly sometimes staby”  that is literally me in a nutshell. Blue: *Uses anime reference correctly*\\n\\nMe; is that an England reference? \"Sadistically meticulous and blindingly self-obsessed\"\\nI mean, are you really complaining that they kept detailed records? Also, I think Alfred was probably worth a mention. \"And began to style himself king of England\"\\nWrong, he styled himself \"king of the English\", John Lackland was the first to start calling himself king of England Yep and it was a title that came as an evolution of the title \"King of the Anglo-Saxons\" used by Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder, and Ælfweard of Wessex before him. PortaTerzo \\nMy mind when Blue messed that up; Dr Cox: Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong - Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. You’re wrong! You’re wrong! You\\'re missing the best part about Æþelſtan: His sister married the king of York and then oops he somehow died like 2 months later what a coincidence so now Æþelſtan had power over the Danelaw and thus became first king of England. English History student, writing before watching, I hope this is good :) .\\nFirst Edit, at the implication that J.C was kicked out, the Kentish actually welcomed him and he decided it was a victory\\nSecond Edit,  Mote and Baileys were also used as a way to actively suppress locals and commit mild genocide, see Harrying the North\\nThird Edit, Royal Gymnastics is fun, but eh subjective opinion\\nFourth Edit, King Henry VI was also a very wet flannel, pancake and a pretty much useless king, this is where the gymnastics of keeping up with the royals is important as much of the losses in France where also due to Henry VI\\'s  inability to lead, it is also this inability that caused him to lose to the Yorkists\\nFith edit, aren\\'t you a classicist major? yaknow Roman study and you\\'re complaining about too many monarchs? Sees a video on the whole history of England : cool\\n\\nSees it’s only 11 minutes long: hol’ up GreenManAiming exactly but the vids still decent Yeah and he pussied out of doing the Civil war and the restoration too Last time I was this early, Romans were still trying to invade the island. That profile picture, I know it. Hello warship waterbender @Garret LeBuis yeah jeremy was more of a lover than a fighter Which time? You\\'ve got Julius Caesar\\'s first and second attempts, Caligula\\'s expedition that turned into a war against Poseidon (\"Think you\\'re bigger than me!?\"), or that time they actually succeeded? I like your name. Try being a kid who had to learn all of this in detail for 9 years!!!\\n\\nAlso poor wales. They didn\\'t eve get lip service XD 11:12\\nBlue: I fear no one. But that ... thing. \\nEarly Modern Europe. It scares me. 5:05 Another detail worth mentioning is that Normandy (and thus the Normans) had Viking origins.  When one of William the Conqueror’s ancestors began invading France, the king made a special province for the vikings who partially integrated into French culture.  It also added complexity for when the Duke of Normandy (under the King of France) was also the King of England. It is not exactly that. The Vikings were defeated by the Franks. But despite being defeated they were given a land to defend, names Normandy, under the condition they became vassals to the King of France. The Viking migration in Normandy was very small. So despite the inhabitants being called Normans, most of the people of the province were of Gallo Frankish stock, hence why the Viking minoriry quickly mixed and adopted French culture Teacher: u CaNt HeAr PiCtUres \\n\\nMe and the rest of the world: 6:00 \"Now the Normans, being from France, were French.\"\\nMe: oh boy there\\'s gonna be some arguing in the comments about that one me: *knows one at least fact about every English monarch since 1066*\\nBlue: Let\\'s have a little royal restraint \\nme: WHY?!?! *cries* You forgot to include Brutus and his sons coming to Albion from Italy!\\n*How dare you?!*\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, I *love* monarchy!!  It\\'s like my entire thing! Hadrian built that wall to keep out my great-x100-grandparents — large, hairy, men so manly that they wear skirts, and throw telephone poles for fun!\\nThe English made the mistake of poking the Scots, so William Wallace started shooting lightning from his eyes and fireballs from his arse and the Muir clan among others went full stabby for several centuries.\\n\\n\\nHow the family ended up on the American west coast a hundred years ago is a subject of much debate at Thanksgiving and Christmas. \"Sometimes friendly... *meh*... Sometimes stabby.\"\\n\\nI SO need that on some merch! 😂 Watching this just after finishing a Linguistics assignment that wanted me to explain how Modern English evolved from Old English. ....Tolkien and Terry Pratchett references were used (NO REGRETS!) And, yes. The English language is a mongrel nightmare when tracking all of the changes it underwent and why. I like Blue\\'s take on it better.

       " 'It\\'s no long the Coronavirus task force briefing, it\\'s a Trump show. After 4 years in office, still blaming the previous Administration. What have you been doing besides blaming others? But he takes credits for the raising of the economy. Blame previous Administration for leaving you a good economy too. How could anyone ever forget a month ago this guy is the same guy that said \"nobody has died\"? Seriously? @Supper Soup Your attempt to justify your initial post is admirable, however, your logic, and apparently your understanding of basic grammatical concepts, is inherently flawed. Breaking down your hastily slapped together response, My understanding of your main points is that:\\nA)Trump took more than one initial action to curb the looming threat of COVID-19\\nB)Democrats told Trump not to enact a travel ban on China.\\nC)Hillary said Trump shouldn\\'t have enacted the travel ban so soon.\\nD)If Hillary was president we\\'d be in \"big trouble\" right now.\\n\\nGiven that we are discussing the adequacy (or lack thereof) of Trump\\'s response to the coronavirus:\\n-Point A makes a claim without providing evidence and therefore renders it Useless with regards to your argument.\\n-Point B is irrelevant as we are examining the adequacy of Trump\\'s actions, not the suggestions given to him by members of the apposing political party.\\n-Point C is irrelevant for the reason stated previously.\\n-Point D is irrelevant as we are examining the adequacy of Trump\\'s Actions, not a hypothetical situation in which Hillary was president. \\n\\nKey Takeaways:\\n-Point A could be used as an effective argument, but you failed to back up your claim with evidence, which makes it\\'s credibility nonexistent.\\n-Points B through D are irrelevant to your argument. This means that even if you were to somehow prove those points to be valid, they would do nothing to further your argument. \\n\\nGrammatical Issues:\\n-\"Not reading all that, You sound like my dad who writes paragraphs for no reason lol not to be rude.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"I\\'m not reading all that. Not to be rude, but you sound like my dad. He writes paragraphs for no reason.\"\\n-\"He took more than one action, lmao.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"He took more than one action.\"\\n-\"Imagine if a democrat person told trump to be even sooner.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: I have no idea how to translate that gibberish honestly.\\n-\"even tho all the democratic \\'recognizable people\\' told him he shouldn\\'t close the way too china.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"Even though the Democrat leaders told him not to enact a travel ban on China.\"\\n-\"thatd be funny.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"That would be Humorous.\"\\n-\"Hilary said trump shouldnt of even closed it that soon, lol.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"Hillary said Trump shouldn\\'t have enacted the travel ban so soon.\"\\n-\"imagine if Hilary was president, we\\'d be in big trouble right now.\"\\nGrammatically Correct Version: \"Imagine if Hillary was president; we would be in big trouble right now.\"\\n\\nNotes:\\nOverall, your argument was exceedingly weak. The only point you made which had any bearing whatsoever on the topic being discussed was Point A, and the lack of supporting evidence for your claim made that point just as useless as your other ones. If you wish to attempt to have even the most basic level of discourse with someone who you disagree with, I would recommend reading their statement fully before attempting to respond. The train wreck of a comment you decided to impose upon the eyes of the innocent people browsing these comments is a perfect example what happens when you attempt to argue with someone and have no idea what their argument is and/or what you\\'re talking about. Going forward I would recommend that you spend more time with your father. It\\'s a massive stretch, but perhaps his love of writing long paragraphs for no reason could be used to teach you some minute semblance of an understanding of the English language and the grammatical concepts associated with it. @Miles Miller Hughes why because Bernie is a punk azz sell out & Biden is worser than Trump..🖕 Miles Miller Hughes Not reading all that, You sound like my dad who writes paragraphs for no reason lol not to be rude. He took more than one action, lmao. Imagine if a democrat person told trump to be even sooner. even tho all the democratic “recognizable people” told him he shouldnt even close the way too china. thatd be funny. Hilary said trump shouldnt of even closed it that soon, lol imagine if Hilary was president, we’d be in big trouble right now. @Supper Soup Yeah... he placed a travel ban on china... That\\'s it. Now we\\'re number 1 in the world for total coronavirus cases (614,246 cases) and deaths (28,300 deaths). By the end of today, that number will undoubtedly be greater than 30,000. To put that in perspective for you, that\\'s more than ten times the number of people that were killed as a result of 911. Leading statistical models project the final death toll in the US to be anywhere from 60,000 to 240,000. Meanwhile, instead of taking further action to halt the spread of the virus, which is disproportionately affecting low income communities (specifically low income black communities), our stable genius of a president is hosting press conferences in an attempt minimize the perceived severity of the situation which I can guarantee you is causing the chromosome-deficient homunculi he calls followers to not take this situation seriously. Normally I would consider the fact that Cletus and Larry want to expose their meth-riddled lungs to the coronavirus to be a net gain for the gene pool, however, by doing this they are only putting the people who are already risking their lives to try and save people at even more risk. But yeah... thank god he took action before it got to the US. @Tray Day 216  Friendly Suggestion: Delete everything you\\'ve ever posted on the internet, acquire a basic understanding of the English language, and try again.

The main reason why the numbers are so high is because of your president\\'s poor leadership! @Aspen Welch what better way to control people, then to tell them they are all infected and are a threat to one another, by loving and wanting to be close? It is truly a war on love and faith and all good things. Think about it. Healthy strong people don\\'t hide away in fear. Healthy people are loving and close to one another. weak people are hidden away in fear and believe they are diseased. A healthy loving person does not focus on being diseased and believe they are infected. Loving people do not believe everyone around them is infected and needs to be controlled and forced out of work. The virus is a war on love, presenting itself as love. @Aspen Welch I want to make it clear that you need to be ready for next winter. Millions are going to be desperate and dying because the governments forced them out of work \"for their own safety\" then when these people get sick and freeze to death in the streets and ice cold apartments, the government will say they \"died from coronavirus\" this is a lie. There is no pandemic. There are liars in the government that take advantage of naive gullible people who believe and do what they are told. @Aspen Welch Most people can\\'t comprehend he possibility that the media and governments would lie to them, but this is so. Coronavirus is a common cold virus. You can research cdc articles going back decades about coronavirus. A small clique of people that control the banks and therefore the media and government, have engineered an imaginary pandemic and planted the seeds for it in movies going back decades. This is an engineered plot to collapse the economy and seize private property. The way the media spins it, it sounds like it is a zombie plague and we all need to hide, yet they even admit that only elderly and infirm are at risk. So why would they literally force at least a third of the population out of work? How does that make any sense, that governments would literally force people not to feed their families, and say it is for their own well being and good? Obviously this is insanity. However, the lie will continue into next year. Over the coming months homelessness will run rampant and by next winter millions could die in the USA alone of exposure and suicide. There will also be many respiratory illnesses, particularly tuberculosis, which has always been a number 1 killer throughout history. The governments will lie and say that the deaths from economic collapse and exposure to cold and unsanitary conditions is \"coronavirus\" but this is just to keep people isolated and prevent communities from communicating with one another and unifying against the authorities. IF you think I am crazy and stupid and a conspiracy theorist, remember what I said when next winter comes and my prophecy comes true. this is a planned economic collapse and takeover and also a mass culling of the population. @Koehli _ With all due respect, what do you believe this I? Just curious there\\'s no pandemic. it doesn\\'t matter whether you like or hate trump. there is no pandemic, never was. it is a lie. I\\'m glad someone\\'s been stepping up.

Fox News: state run minion control virtual reserve, like imagine a ventilator, believe you have one. and suddenly feel  better😂 Very good. \\nIt\\'s like being prescribed Placibex.\\nTake 2 Placibex in the evening and one feels better in the morning. This guy talk like a child because he use a child language You do realize that your own language is not perfect either...? WE\\'RE DOOMED \"Airlines are in great shape\"?!?   \"We\\'ve been strong on it, very powerful on it\"?!?   \"WHO role in severely mismanaging and covering up\"?!?  \\xa0\\nAnd that\\'s just the first 2 minutes...tuning out...I would rather watch the real \"Loony Tunes\\' (cartoons!).\\nWhere is the upside in all this BS???  One less day till November...VOTE! Peter Bardadyn Yes, Sir. I’ll be voting TRUMP 2020. Peter Bardadyn id rather not vote, 2 idiots running against each other again, a voting system that is outdated and doesnt actually give the people a say (as much as i hate clinton she should have been pres because majority), as well as living in certain states means the state will automatically be a certain side. No point in voting on a national level Who did mis manage and cover up the coronary outbreak in December and refuses to acknowledge taiwan\\'s amazing response. To be fair though, the WHO is an absolute joke. The rest of what he said however... Not really the case He did\\'nt know what Dr Fauci said ? no one knows what he said apparently ? wtf He is using the confusing others tactics! The man clearly has no idea what his talking about! #deflect #nocarenoresponsibility 😆 Steven Gray 😂 He said the right thing but the economy is more important I mean money so let’s put em back to work omfg I was laughing so hard while he\\'s reading all the name of his sponsors with his 5th grad reading abilities. Jesus Christ the crisis of a life time & the leader of the freeworld is the imbecil. Dude the irony He\\'s extremely smart he went to Trump University 😂! He’s sick & trying to hide it..... The only dictator in history to get away with wearing a silly hat without putting on a silly hat... The job of president ain\\'t what it used to be! He got me saying I know I can do this job. I saw Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama. Not once did I ever even consider the fact of this job of president. BUT, when I saw this fool, i knew instantly, instantly, that not only could I do the job but also do it well. He lowered the standard of the most important job in the world. USA has become a joke after this dude was elected as president tom tom We’re a reality show that’s on its 4th season. The government just ordered 167 million masks from 3M. 3M’s plant in China will make most of them. Excuse me   JUST ordered today after more than  20000 ppl dead ? where eveer has the cheapest manufacturing.  America\\'s nickname should be \"Cheapskates of America\" Lol 14:52 that man should be president instead im waiting on dr evil to release the vaccine after making his billions.  its a rerun chimera virus MOVIE MI 2 Lmao the government corrupt not him 53:03 when the teacher ask you who do you want to help you pass out the cupcakes He wasn\\'t even allowed to clean the erasers in school The 1% elites know what is happening @Socialism Kills Where did you get 12 million from? @Socialism Kills You realize that there\\'s not some invisible mass of 400 million immigrants right? @C D thank God I have free Healthcare More like 0.001% elites @Discount Ronaldo What about the millions who don\\'t have jobs while all the money is going to fake wars? @ 33:11, crank up the volume, you can hear the yawning. Does he ever take personal responsibility? Lupinespirit Candles and Crochet \\n\\nNo. How many people have died today? That doesn\\'t  look like a \"great\" progress in our fight against the virus, that beast is still killing a lot of people. Hello! It is now 28,300 Over 2000 deaths today making the number state wise 25,767 deaths I\\'m a American and I approve of my Message My question is why did you put an end to the Pandemic Staff when you got into the White House? Answer because Obama Started it! @Ice Cloud 2012 is really  2024, this covid-19 is the plage in revolutions. We basically have 4 more years on this  planet this Is just the beginning to the End. Protect yourself and your Family WorldWar3 is going to be Next. OB1 lmao I don’t get how people can defend trump, he’s barely done anything to stop this and ignored all warning signs. OB1 \\nThat’s his response to everything most of the time. Don’t blame me, blame Obama. MONEY MONEY MONEY, THats all he thinks about every few seconds.\\nVentilators that you could have manufactured earlier this year, but you said NO they will not be needed, because we will be back at work by EASTER.

Working from home has been nice. I\\'ve been high af on every zoom call. Just wear a hat.😎 fact check pls 1 month ago on his words to now... and when do we get to see trump in hazzard suit on the frontline---->>>NEVER.Caus he dont care Would you please stop blaming! My local California pd just went around town giving citations for broken fence pickets and then started giving tickets for violating stay at home orders. Money Money Money! Give me freedom or give me death. At this point the less the federal government is involved, the better. Kenysian principles have and never will work You know exactly when he goes off script 😭 But are you going to pardon joe exotic though? stop watching his conferences!! he thinks it\\'s apprentice and it\\'s confusing him more than the cat in the hat or a 3rd grade english book, or a math book, ok anything above 2nd or 3rd grade. Such a stable genius ... :/ words fail me Me too. But words fail him far more... the handful that he knows, that is! LOL As an Australian, I am just so glad  trump isn\\'t  our leader. Here experts direct government  action, facts and figures  are openly shared.  The state and national  governments are united  and there is  no blaming.  Trump is a complete joke and dangerous I believe. https://youtu.be/qSyvU9oMs5Q @Jenny look  at Australia  a bit closer  before  carrying on. Full public  health care  and welfare system.   Look at the number of  cases and death  rates. @Danny S  sadly your wrong mate. The is the head of state  but she has little  influence  on  domestic  affairs.   The commonwealth is a leader in reducing inequality  something  the usa could  learn  a lot from.   Just look at the facts and provision of health  and community  care in each country. Why don’t you shut up and worry about your own countries governance . Country of loosers both Australia and Canada your president is the queen of\\n England. Nothing he says ever sound sincere, sounds like a middle schooler reading a presentation they didn’t practice for.  This Guy is a Cornball Tj\\nHis smug pumpkin needs to tell tell thruth and NE3DS TO GO Looks like Donny took his downers today. That is Mr President to you!!! Learn your place . Somkit looks hot @CozmicPlayz Games Thank you ;) Nice pfp Still on adderall though. \"WHO\" the fall guy. This is the same narrative we hear all the time. Someone always have information beforehand and there\\'s a lack of response but thousands of lives are lost. We\\'re being played people. Same script different actors. @Lineage2Ertheia \\nChina is being transparent, at least in this case.\\nLet alone the information they gave, their action back then means a lot, even if your government decides to ignore the information they gave directly.\\n\\nJan 23, a major city like Wuhan is locked. \\nWestern media: Barbaric Communist.\\nObvious Fact: A deadly disease capable of transmitting human-to-human is coming.\\n\\nAfter massive outbreak,\\nUSA: WHO is lying! China is lying! \\n\\nFunny, how the information was readily available, but then you people decide to dissect and pick whatever that suits you or your agenda. @ANDREW MCVAY At this rate that won\\'t stay that way for long. Of course the WHO lied Lineage2Ertheia bill gates is the single largest independent donor behind the U.S. (fauci is on the board of gates foundation.) WHO DID LIE BECAUSE THEY ARE BOUGHT BY CHINA, TRUMP IS RIGHT TO CALL THEM OUT At the end of that tunnel u will see my people 🇲🇽🇲🇽😂 yessirrr Draining the swap!!!!!! 👏👏 33:10  \"Yaaawwn...\". thanks for 1200- i just bought some meth! I want my country back . And Trump\\'s doing that List of CEO names not necessary . he just wants mcdonalds and kfc opened back up fast!! @SGt Smith He could just use door dash. I\\'m sorry but why does it matter what he eats? Obama loves \"pizza and hot dogs\". That\\'s more important if you know what I mean. I know they never closed but he cant get the limo into the drive thru. lmbo yea the synthetic food made an orange zombie. They never closed... SGt Smith more synthetic food for all the zombies 🧟\\u200d♂️ We had everything in place to deal with a situation exactly like this. A play book to follow. This MORON removed people who deal with these situations, and took away money. NOW he can stand there and blame the W.H.O ?  No shame at all. OOOOPS! DID I HIT A NERVE? CALM DOWN, WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS. dude’s gonna mic drop. Blaming the WHO for his own failings he\\'s the one who caused the  panic in America not the WHO ,won\\'t take responsibility for his own actions The Numbers for vertelaters are Not impotent Reaktion was to late „We are in great shape,it working wonderfully,all the tests are available...“ but background filled with ambulance/police alarm, helicopter sounds......people are dying, lives are gone, a „leader“ solely focused on his reputation and delusions Tuff times we don\\'t know when our time is up ! To be save \\n\\nFrom your Heart Repent of your sins to God, ask God for forgiveness of your sins \\n\\nBelieve, Confess, Except, allow,  Jesus Christ into your Heart as your Lord and Saviour who died on the cross for your sins and has Risen in 3 days \\n\\nBelieve ! \\n\\nLove you all and God bless you all my Brother\\'s and Sister\\'s of God Is he holding the federal government over the Governor’s head???? He can’t be serious!!! Not if they don’t listen to King Trump. Instead of that doctor using the press conference as a fashion show she ought to use her shoulder scarf as a mask. I heard on the radio today that the sale of those scarves increased dramatically. She has a future in the fashion industry after her govt job. She achieved her objective. @ak Alksdr Her scarf definately is! ;) @Holly Perrin Naah, She\\'s more concerned about her image than her health. Who knows she might be from Paris. Hahahaha!  I live in France where they outlawed the Islamic veil.  Now, they\\'re considering legislation to make it illegal to NOT wear a mask.  I\\'m pretty sure that the doctor is wearing that scarf to use as a mask the moment that she\\'s not on camera.  You think? Looking at the thumbs up and thimbs down.  I\\'ve never seen such a close competition. Pres. Trump Thank you! 😚 Lord help us! John Ronald Darville BA, MSc, JP \\n\\nIts a hoax. Don’t worry. Look at all the prophets and mini nostradamuses in the comments lol. Cute. Hope2BeDope Entertainment 😂 Yall are fkn stupid. So dumb and the type of morons that make us weak Hope2BeDope Entertainment I don’t blame them... Trump’s doesn’t help because he’s a moron. orwell would be astounded You know Animal Farm was how he saw the governments in 1945. I don\\'t think the Farm being more crazy than it was then would no be a surprise to him. Body language says he is lying. We are screwed. Awesome Timeless \\nBody language and speaking go hand in hand, if you’re confident your speaking and body language reflect it, and vise versa. Keniso S. Speaking is not body language. He’s not speaking with confidence. Compare his speeches to Obama and you’ll see. How does his body language show lying? When he starts pumping his hands, that\\'s when you know the B.S. is being sold hard. His technique is good, his intentions are bad. Sounds wrong. Why fight America and Americans? The enemy of America is actually Putin and his assets and allies.  That\\'s you, homie. Yea out of about the 200,000,000 that get the flu in the world each year. This is a lot for the 2,000,000 that has got this in the past few months *The TRUTH and the only TRUTH is in any War, Democrat, liberals, and reporters are always side with the enemy.* @dsvet per YEAR. The 126k deaths happened in a matter of months. The only reason the rate is slowing down...and the only reason you can post what you did is because we all started taking measures. @dblj48 Donald J. Trump is a Liberal, whatever that means. Fake dude leading deluded desperate hateful hollow hecklers. He should have followed the pandemic playbook that was in place and keep the yearly central warehouses of medical supplies checked. Are we going to re-elect him again? I don’t approve the way he treated professionals. He should be more serious than this I think I can safely submit a law of nature for scientific approval.\\n\\nNo person that I know who is honest and earned their money, EVER SPENT A DIME OF IT TELLING PEOPLE HOW GOOD THEY ARE.\\n\\nSo, unless you can prove otherwise. Any person who does this is hereby, spending money they did not earn.\\n\\nThat is a big RED FLAG. See something, say something. Trump is doing such a great job leading the USA in these hard times. Sad that fake news keeps reporting him so poorly 👌 Maybe because he reads like a first grader 🤷🤦 “We have the most powerful... the plan is so powerful... it’s the most powerful you won’t even believe it—everything is POWERFUL, POWERFUL, POWERFUL.”  Ok, US with the most coronavirus cases on the planet, US the most death of any country.  Garbage federal response from the liar-in-thief.\\n\\nFox Trump knuckle draggers: USA! USA! USA! We’re number one!  Stupid, just stupid. It\\'s a hoax. Naw, but the song gives some levity on you know who: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbOudgH6dCc Trump has changed, seems like a script Bc they all are putting this on him and he knows he cant escape it. LMAO.. just shut up sometimes. Your fkin doom earthlings, watching from planet Neptune 👽👽🛸🛸👽 Can\\'t he just listen to the full questions first lord 😭😳 @GeM HunTeR all do respect my darling, but isn\\'t that the job he applied for, yes the reports are a bit full on, however, controling a question is something none of us can do. If he can\\'t handle it he needs to step aside and let someone that can take the pressure take the job to be honest, the reporter is overreaching. i hate donald duck, but if he give in to one, the other reporter will do worse...... ❤ you ran away from your responsibility, and now its not me its them What a liar he is blaming the WHO for his failings he\\'s the one in charge ,but he would listen to the professional  people because he\\'s a stable genius right Victoria Milan hes saying what hes told to be saying. At this point im convinced even trump is a pawn in whatever greater game is being played with this virus no compassion or remorse HAHAHA! Nice, grating audio, NBC. \\nYou guys are so terribly pathetic. TreeOfLifeSword 😂👍🏽 I JUST CAME HERE TO SEE HIM ANSWER QUESTIONS.. NOT TO HEAR HIS READING!..

       " 'who\\'s watching this during 2020 coronavirus pandemic me yes just started lookng at shares. May be a good time to buy but not sell How many vids have you comment on asking this?? Ryan Stevens hi there. I was watching it. Are you trading these days? lol he said we will have a crash in 5 years, little did he know it was soon Mr CHARLES  @Charles_forex09 has helped me and my family abundantly. I really wished I had known him earlier by now I know I would have made more than enough. I invested with him and made $10,000 in a week trade reach him @Charles_forex09 ⭕️n INSTAGRAM to start earning also. The crash is yet to happen, that was just  a warm up. 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 Sienna Christy Also wasn’t a crash lol Sienna, he said \"within the next five years\". There\\'s a difference. The secret to my financial independence is having a steady income stream (passive investment) and a hardworking and reliable broker Richard Bill, my portfolio has grown tremendously since i started  investing with him too and I\\'m really impressed with the huge profits made. I appreciate the trust built over these past few weeks of working with Richard and I respect him for his honesty and hard work. Oh nice to meet other investors of Sir Richard. Having him as a guide, i have only recorded winnings, his hard work is even huge compared to the minor 20% commission fee he charges @Raymond Bull Yeah, you can go write him at <<officialrichardbill@gmail.com>> Traders can try all the strategies they see on YouTube. But I can tell for a fact most will still lose money due to improper knowledge on how the liquidity providers manipulate the stock charts, that is why the importance of investing with a good broker can not be over emphasized. I always advise traders to invest with Richard\\'s platform. On his platform I never experience any issues of re-quote or fake slip. Your explanation is seriously on point mate, like honestly. Thank you for taking some of your own personal time to explain this concept! Thanks mate. I\\'ve lost count of how many times I\\'ve tried to learn about the stock market. This was really helpful. Heres to lots of money! You know you\\'re an Australian when you recognize where this table is from! amart furniture not kmart @Camille kmart fucking rules FROTH KMART Good old Kmart haha i have one Bahahaa I\\'m actually sitting at the same table and didn\\'t even notice 😂 Great video.. well i don’t think I’m buying or holding any shares for now. I’ll rather stick to my cryptocurrency trading. @Billy Ramson Bot. gg @Rossi Moreno Bot. gg About Juseverything I need to learn how to mine I will lie to take this opportunity and invest in bitcoin. That’s guys for the recommendation. Wow I know Davelucastrades. He’s among the financial analysts and trading experts who have aged out theories and ideas for trading. lmao this is the kinda guy to get a raw 50 in buisness management and accounting . love the vid Finally an aussie one.. Thnx you sm Whats was specific to aussie? I’m 15 years old and I’m tryna learn all of this stuff and then I’ll start investing when I’m 18.. it’s kinda complicated tho.. ehh I’ll get through it im 14  i started to sell things on ebay and im keeping my ebay  money for shares when i get older I wish I was as sensible as you when I was 15 i’m 15 aswell Tristan Stevens I mean you can do both Don’t get distracted with girls and going out when you turn 18 Nice and clear explanation...\\nThanks for all the information mate..\\nwas really helpful.. Great video Hamish, always wanted to visit Australia myself, lovely place. \\n\\n\\n\\nTake care dude. $1752 ToDay. * po.st/icMarket * Thanks! And definitely make a visit to Australia :D Great intro Hamish!\\n\\n\\nOwn businesses, not stocks. Invest long term. Solid advice :) Despite being an investor in ASX for some time.\\nI learned a lot from your video.\\nCheers 👌 haha what I honestly didn\\'t think a video about investing by some guy in a hoodie would be helpful, but it totally was. Great and informative video, I learned a lot! Love this, simply clear explanation & for someone that knows nothing about it I am very determined to learn about it before going in. Thanks! everything made sense now Hey mate,\\nIm looking to get into the stock market! Your explanation has really helped me!\\nRegards,\\nBen Hey Hamish, I just started watching videos on investing today. Came across your video, just wanted to say thank you for the information. Very helpful thanks mate. Same here! Great stuff thankyou for sharing great explanation. What do you think about selfwealth? is it trustworthy? June 2019 - We haven\\'t had a crash in a very long time....if you start investing now its likely that you\\'re going to see a crash within the next 5 years\\n\\n\\nMarch 2020 - Crash @KR Arguelles Thanks. @Kyo-Kun also, toss a coin to your witcher oh valley of plenty. @Kyo-Kun I\\'m a complete beginner as well that\\'s why i\\'m watching this :D I recommend doing a lot of research. A lot of people are taking advantage of the crash because eventually the market will recover and most companies will. Is it still worth investing now or should I wait till this whole pandemic thing is over? (I\\'m a beginner sorry if I sound stupid) Thanks great video!\\nCan I ask, in the senario I\\'d like to sell my stocks when the market price is high? is there always an ability to sell, regardless of the price? in other words will there always be a buyer? Great video. Super straight forward overview on how things work. The perfect video for the basics Thank you Hamish, cheers ! I would like to know whats the go with investing internationaly with for eg , Tesla on an australian platform like ANZ . good or bad ? Good stuff mate. You’ve said exactly what I’m telling my sons..\\nAs of February 24 2020 though we have the commencement of our expected “crash”! “I consistently outperform the market” you lost me with this one.. For hong long have you been “outperforming the market”... \\nMaybe you are the next Warren Buffett. Can you do a video on the use and function of CHESS, HIN in relation to having multiple brokerage accounts? Yay!! I understood everything 😂😂😂 finally! Thank you soo much for this !❤️ subscribed 😊 Significant video, it is simple to understand. Thank you for the great content hey hamish thank you for this video and your channel i am a teenager who is interested in the stock market and would like to invest sometime in the future Despite the economic crisis , this is still a good time to invest in gold and crypto @George chadimare you a scam artist? Thanks will do that ASAP You can write her up through her email \\nVeronicapedro079@gmail @Larry Mullen How do you start trading with Mrs Veronica ? .... pls I\\'m interested and wanna invest too 🙏🙏 I met Mrs Veronica last year for the first time at a conference in London , i invested £21,300 and traded in one month  making close to £ 124,070 Really appreciate the time you took to make this. Very clear and easy to understand mate. Keep it up! the stock market is evidently the biggest market in the world, perhaps that\\'s why every economic breakdown affects its market trend. Coming from one who has been a keen follower of the stock market, the stock market trade is very lucrative but along the line you would see the world is getting set for a major digital revolution. Our local and international currencies are being taken over by digital currencies and its a fast taken route. 1 bitcoin is worth over $9000 and its still on the raise. i tried bitcoin for the first time when i came across a video of it online and since then i was fascinated by it, and i met Allen Albert who taught me how bitcoin can be managed, traded to maximize profit, on my first week i made  $40,700 from an initial trading capital of $10,000. I would recommend Albert to anyone willing to try out bitcoin and how beneficial it can be, he can be reached  on tellygram *(albertrade)* or *Whatsapp *(+44 738 035 6836)* for guidance. . Let\\'s move together, these are good times Still learning under Allen Albert, but I must say, I can see the positive impact already. I now I understand charts and market flow Bitcoin over dollar anyday, I use Albert services a couple of times till I got to analyse the the market for myself With time I think, more people would be more receptive to the use of crypto currencies Digital currencies sounded crazy back then, who would have believed I would be here watching videos on them and having some for myself If only some people would be patient to understand that Bitcoin isn\\'t going anywhere, instead it\\'s taking over the globe. Are most of the shares that you invest in pay dividends Hi Hamish, great video & really easy to understand for the beginner. I have a question for you mate... I\\'m only new to investing & have recently downloaded the new Commsec Pocket app so was wondering what\\'s your thoughts on if I was only to use the Commsec Pocket app for investing what ETFs would you recommend to in sure I have a good mix across the markets? Cheers Great place to start! The comsec app makes it very simple to invest into diversified etf\\'s globally. All you need to do is choose which one best suits your investment goals and risk tolerance :) Honestly, your explanation is exactly what I was looking for. Awsome! I’ll live in Australia in copule of months and I investing already in Stocks in my country. Are There something like REITs in Austrália too? Hey Hamish! Do you need a broker? and if so where can i find one in Aus? My grandparents have givin me alot of money to me and my cousins in investments but im not sure how it works so youve made it alot more clear How much? Great video Hamish! Thanks so much for putting this together in such a clear and easy to understand way! Thinking of breaking into the market. This video has given me a bit of guidance as to how 🙌 thank you so much! Good to see an aussie vid very nicely explained !! thumbs up and thank you!! Thanks heaps man. Your video just answered so many questions. Subscribed. Welcome to the team! Have you got any topics you\\'d like to see me cover? Hey Hamish, I just started using nabtrade to trade. I am just wondering is it possible or how to do bracket/range options in that platform? Great video bro. Explained with clarity and very easy to understand, thanks 🙏 solid work! Thanks mate Hey mate, how are you? I hope I can get your attention on my question (might be silly, but I`m totally new on it) I`m not from Australia, I`m here with student visa, but I want to start some way investing in share/stock market, do you think is possible, do you know any rules that says I cant do it? I try to find something about it, but I didn\\'t find it. Thanks btw, and your channel and that vid its awesome!!! Cheers Looking at investing for the first time. This was really helpful! Thankyou it only take a well diversified market maker to point out favorable stock conditions or equivalently help to adjust your portfolio the right way, having a diverse asset spreads is ideal because it helps to reduce risk while maximizing return. Charles surely has more beneficiary portfolio. I know for sure it works Ahmet considering your trading tactics it seems more favorable. I hope it helps on my portfolio. Transparency is good for me Reach him \\nAllentradeoptions{a} gmai!•com He can help you achieve the same success investing with his brokerage. total transparency where you monitor your tradings and make withdrawals on your account. Thanks for the infornation. I am still learning about investing.  What can you say about the online trading platforms versus the top  brokers that you mentioned? as someone who never understood stocks, i have never come across a video that explains all elements so thoroughly such as this one! thanks heaps :)) Thank you Hamish for the presentation. I am very new to investing into shares but you have given me a lot of insight  and I am beginning to get the Knowledge needed . Great video mate really helped me out. Good stuff. I wanted to be financially successful through forex trading and with the help of my mentor and expert trader, I am achieving my goals Please do not listen to this clearly spruked comment designed to generate business. @razvan - can you post PROOF of long term gains with your Forex experience here for everyone to see? I am very excited because I am also a big fan of his.I have benefited immensely from his expert services 🙂 *jcolemantrader* (ät) *gmäil*  *cöm* @Summer Scarlett He is a very open and transparent man who is vastly experienced in his craft. Give him a go and see what happens @Suarav Gautam It definitely is especially. He has changed the finances of my family and I. I’m looking at buying my first shares so have been madly reading info on the web and in magazines. Your presentation is excellent and so well structured. Thank you :) Love it. Thank you for your time <3 Do you make more money in Youtube than stock trading???..... And thank you for this video ..🙏🏻 One thing that\\'s never mentioned in these stock investment video\\'s. So here goes with my advice.  If you work for a public company buy  a share or two.  Why you ask.. If you work for a company, management will never tell you exactly what they are doing especially when a new EBA is being negotiated. If you have a share you can go to the share holder meetings where you will get the truth and the ammunition to negotiate a new EBA. Very well and simply explained Hamish. I\\'m going through the learning process and I\\'ve subscribed. Your words resonated with me loud and clear. Thank you! Great video. Thank you very much. And your English is very very clear. I am still learning English but I can understand your video without subtitle. This was so informative and I finally understand the stock market a bit better! Do you have any videos on day trading or swing trading or do you simply invest for the long term? Thanks :) Just long term :) Thank you for your video, it was well made and very informative. The one thing that I might still hope to learn is something specific to the ASX. You did mention using the broker of the 4 major banks but is that it? Thanks again. You might want to look at CMC markets or self wealth Dr Michael as an alternative to the big banks! Or if you are looking at an app specific to Australia then Raiz or Spaceship Voyager might be a good choice. Thank u very very much! It was quite simple to understand and uve earned a subscriber today 👍 you got me! you have skills mate. seriously. thumbs up @Hamish Hodder No worries. you\\'re certainly well communicated. I saw that first vid where you outlined the 4 steps of investing strategy. i subscribed but its not that obvious as to which video i should watch next. clicked on a few, but they lost me. which videos would you recommend watching next. beginner obviously. Thank you for watching Tobias! day trading has been lot easier trading with *zaheer_tradesfx* at lG as my mentor i never had any loss, all my trades are top and he uses the best signal in the world Recently I got into the youtube financial niche, and I’ve taken a deep dive into investing, particularly dividend growth investment as it interests me. Tried several methods trying to figure out the best approach to building my portfolio. So far, I’m making progress with the help of my financial advisor. Back to the video, wonderful job there, always look forward to your next content. I don’t make that much, but I sure do make enough. However, it will not be a bad idea to hear from a professional. Came across Alec Payden at an investment webinar. You can get all the information you need, just leave him a message if you have inquiries Alecpayden (a)  g ma il. Com....you can look him up if you like. It’s almost the same situation here. The difference is that I got off early enough to know that financial planning would help me go a long way. I’m in my 60’s and reaping off my hardwork. I’m literally 12 and I’m trying to invest $1000. Thanks for the video! You have earned a new subscriber! No, don\\'t do what he says at the end. Don\\'t try and pick stocks. Just invest in ETFs and you will get similar returns over the long run with a minute fraction of the effort and maintenance... That was great! Cheers! Dont mean to be a creep but my mothers maiden name is hodder ? Great video for beginners to the markets keep up the good work! Hi Hamish, thank you so much for the video. Is there any chat room or place where you hang out and discuss trading strategies? Also, is there anyone who would like to connect as a day trader? thanks it was very easy understanding for starter in in ASX I resonate with the disgust involved in mentioning Bing to any extent. I am glad I am not alone in this emotion. This was so helpful! Really helpful video! Cheers Just freaking awesome!!! Hi Hamish..thanks for the clear explanation on investing in the stock market. Very helpful for me as a beginner. 👍 Cee Gee hi there. So which stocks are you trading these days? Can you do video on new IPO Manuka Resources : Gold and Silver mining company. MKR:ASX Can you explain how to sell. For example, one of my shares I bought for $10. and now they are $30. I want to sell straight away. How do we do this? Great video. Maybe you could talked about technical analysis and fundamentals analysis. I am totally new to all this and want to look at getting into the stock market as part of my investment strategy for the future.\\nI saw a financial advisor and he charged me $5,000 and all he did was move my super into his company\\'s super plan, try to sell me a $3,000 income protection and TPD insurance policy which I said no to and he drew up a budget plan for me that included a further $135 per month ongoing maintenance plan for him to manage my finances. That\\'s right he charged me $5,000 and I still don\\'t know which direction to take, so I am \"Very\" skeptical about finance brokers.\\nI have totally no idea how to \"Safely\" get into the stock market so would going through my bank \"one of the big 4 Aussie banks\" be a good starting point? I\\'m sorry but you\\'re a fucking idiot. How about investing your funds on Mrs Kat Tillet Strategies where you EARN HOW 100% of your returns in trading.???? I’ve been trading for going on 5 years now, and have had many experiences ranging for hours of technical analysis studies to providing Forex signals, managing accounts and even CEO of my own Forex Educational & Management Business; however what I’ve learned from Kat Tillett and her team is beyond eye opening. With these teachings, I’ve had nothing but continued success. Thanks Hamish, for your insights and advice Every investor will always tell you that there\\'s no better time to invest in the financial market. I\\'ve been into stock trade for quite a while now, and I must say it really goes with loss without the right approach and strategy. I have gotten to the point where I understand that strategy is a key element of a long term successful trading. You can keep making wins at the beginning of a period and later, you start making losses toward the end of the trading period or even halfway. This results from little or no attention to the need for sustenance and consistency with the prevailing market structure. I\\'ve earned about $38,150 so far this month trading with Mr.Noah\\'s strategies and working with his trading signals. You may never find it easy trading on your own. If you are tired of losing so much money, I recommend you contact him via Whatsapp; +12097883347. He\\'s a genius trader Hahahaha this ad His strategies are amazing , Getting more experienced in stock market trading has thought me a lot these past months after trading so closely with his strategy and analysis which proves helpful, I saw my winning ratio increasing everyday as my trading improved as well. His strategies are amazing , Getting more experienced in stock market trading has thought me a lot these past months after trading so closely with his strategy and analysis which proves helpful, I saw my winning ratio increasing everyday as my trading improved as well. It\\'s a good time right now Rule #1 investor Your video is quite interesting as I am currently investing in Aussie company AD8 Thank You Seriously. Nice video. What it the best platform to do day trading in Australia?? TBH I would stick to US based stocks like NASDAQ, I started in Australian stocks (as i live here), however there was much more money to be made (imo) in NASDAQ than ASX. I would have said stocks is trash about six months ago if i haven\\'t had a succession of payouts  from investing in the market using *Alec Payden\\'s* services. Scam alert dont fall for thjs To think that i attended a lecture recently where he was invited to talk on averaging and actuarial analysis yet i don\\'t know he trades for people, I\\'m definitely getting in touch with him. Thanks for the recommendation and guide. The importance of investing now is not debatable, trading is a goldmine with very few miners and best to tap in with an expert if you intend to go far. Or (40) 371 700314 on whatsapp How does AUSTUDY and shares work? when will it effect my pay? Hi man, great video, thanks. I am using NAB and want to start investing only $2000 to learn... should I stay with NAB or using one of the online platform? And Should I just use efts asx200 or pick myself few different company? What do you recommend? Thanks for helping Com bank has not a good reputation. ',\n",

Ignorance is a bliss! :) Helping to learn new things. \\nThank you lou, you opened my eyes. @Dersu Uzala I think paper would be much too thin for acrylic paint. I would use a canvas and if you don\\'t like it you can always reuse the canvas by simply painting over it ☺️ @lou lee Should I use the same materials or can I start with much basic tools? Like painting on a paper? Just take it step by step. Pause video often. I started painting a few months ago and my first 20 were god awful lol.

My one is a British shorthair x Russian blue. She was £250 @Dark Angel https://www.tica.org/breeds/find-a-cat/breeder-listings Just a word of caution before buying a British Shorthair. They\\'re prone to having heart problems. Ours was three and she had a heart attack and died suddenly. God i love that cat so sorry for your loss. @Meg Lucas that sucks. terrence samps medication can manage it but it’s a progressive disease. @Meg Lucas so they just die from heart attack? There\\'s a way to stop that terrence samps there isn’t a diet that can prevent it Packing a small suitcase for a trip to the UK and bringing home. \"souvenir\" 😍 You sympathetic as a real true British blue shorthair!!!!!!!!!!!!! Most importantly: THEY CHOMNK 😍😍😍😍😍 Meanwhile my adopted street cat : *dominates everyone with an iron claw then sits on me and purrs* I’ve got one called Tupac 😂 such a good cat, but so needy. Irma good name I’m waiting for my lil one to be born and can have him in December.  Needy is what I wanted in his personality lol Character :,, Quiet\"..\\n\\nGuess my British Shorthair is broken then 😂 Or he just really likes talking to us 😂👍 Thats my cat...she is small..but she is the boss of my six cats and two dogs.. @S Wijaya...I had two cats to start with..I found four feral kittens at a house that I was renovating..and decided to keep all of them..I have a mastiff-rotti cross..and a blue heeler-border collie-pit bull cross... DurdyClaude 😂😂😂 1:46 looks more like a Russian Blue instead of a Brit They are both beautiful cats Because it\\'s definitely a Russian blue lol Fellow cat lovers just of aware of this, since even the OP never brought it up.  Feline infectious peritonitis or (FIP) is high risk in British short hair cats.  Google it and you find a world of information on it but its deadly to any cat that gets it.  Unfortunately for me I found out the hard way, I ended up getting a 4 month old British short hair kitten and 85 days later I had to put him to sleep due to FIP. \\nFIP can occur at any age, yet typically it is most often seen in young cats, less than two years of age, and most of these in the four- to 10-month period, there is no commercially effective vaccine for this disease.   I was never aware or knew anything about this disease, you can\\'t test for it.  I believed I did all the right things,  very clean house, never outside, never around any animals, no cheap cat food etc..  I ended up spending $4000 in vet fees trying to save him, I would of spent more if necessary, but it appeared in had the worse FIP (wet)... I\\'m not trying to scare you but ask your Vet about FIP. \\nIn the short time we had our kitten, he became part of the family and we changed a lot for him to make him happy.  You can see a picture of him here, but just know I was there until the very end rubbing him the way he liked it until his last breath, I know many people have gone through putting pets down but this event came out of no where and devastated us.  You see a picture of him here but he was put to sleep due to wet FIP ... https://www.toopics.com/p/2051265180806718504_12566775092 I want one of those grey ones. I would name him/her: Ash vs Evil Dead ❤️ I’m bringing home two British shorthair kittens ( brothers ) in June. I can hardly wait! 🐱💗🐱💗🤗 I have a girl called Willow and she is the sweetest little baby but she has a bit of an attitude lol @gregje11 I have two sisters. They\\'re six. They get along but sometimes they pick on each other. One of them is mellow and shy but the other is the stereotypical sibling who can\\'t resist the urge to give wedgies and noogies. i already have 2 british shorthairs (brother and a sister) and they are so cute 🥺😍 How are they? I have 2 shorthair brothers.. they love eachother dearly. You\\'ve made a good decision getting 2. Poofy cheeks. 1:45  That\\'s a Russian Blue cat. YES My BSH Millie is anything but quiet. She’s super vocal and has established certain vocabulary which we can understand. Very sociable indeed n even follows the gas man. Love her to bits Beautiful cats. Unfortunately we lost ours this year to cancer. Miss him so much! ☹️ So sorry for your loss. I too lost mine to cancer nearly one year ago.  He certainly was a family member and we miss him very much 😢 Sorry for your lost. That must have been the hardest reality to digest. I have one, he’s adorable and loving. Follows me everywhere and likes to sleep on my lap, but he absolutely hates being picked up I call them the posh cat lol When you don’t know about a cat until you watch an anime. JJBA if anyone was wondering. Some small corrections.  Firstly they were  first introduced in the 1st Century AD and bred with local wild cats.  They eventually became known as Barn cats, or Cheshire cats, and were useful for their ratting capabilities.  Around the time after WW1 they were bred with Persian cats, and around WW2 with Russian Blue and French Chartreux cats, that gave them a few extra colours and those orange eyes some have. I had One of these she died at 18 years old she was also blind and deaf 😥😥 I\\'m soo sorry for your loss Fitting with other cats you say. \\nOur one is like the devil himself :D I’m getting mine Friday! 8/30. Excited! Meow there old chap, can I interest you in a cup of tea embellished with rats. I found a grey cat exactly like this one. he kept following me for maybe 100 meters and wont leave i had to take him home Watching this while my cat lays on my chest purring 😂 \"very friendly, loving\"\\n\\nHere comes my cat who hates everyone and everything Ah yes, at last i found you, *STRAYU CATO!* Yoshikage Kira Naruto Yoshikage Kira The cat you used to blow people up. Wait, don’t you already have a cat that does that? jojo! One of my favorite cat breeds. I’m getting a little kitten in a week so I’m very excited and it’s a British shorthair. so thanks for Thea’s tips about the British shorthair personality !!!!!!!!✌🏻 I  LOVE THESE CATSSS As I own one about to one two :) AKA \"The Churchill Cat\"! Bought one of these for my boyfriend.. he says she’s changed his life... he thought he wasn’t a cat guy. He adores this little ball of fur. I love this breed so much!! I have one, his name is Mushu!! He’s beautiful!! pinauka a me too.  Mine is called Brodee lou This is my dream cat😍 i want to have one I wish to donate my cat to you. Is a dumbass cat I have four British short hairs lily,daisy,bear and sonny Too late, already got one, and she’s the best! Just keep it away from ancient burial grounds and you\\'ll be fine... @Play brothers in gaame pet semetary Wait what movie anony mous haha really xD It was so predictable :p Lol that film was terrifying. I saw the remake and I was screaming in the cinema EpicPony nice 👌 Thank You this is just what I needed to watch this morning, gorgeous little kittens playing...awwwww Nani!? Sturay Catto? They dont need scratchers, the arm of the couch (I mean chesterfield) will do fine I’m getting a BS kitten at the end of August- am integrating him into my pack of one sweet tabby boy who is the love of my life.. and several pugs who inhabit my life first and foremost as I’ve bred and shown them for two decades.  I’ve always had a huge crush on the BS Blue variety especially.. am beyond excited about this addition!  :) This comment B.S.\\nThis video is B.S.\\nMy cat is BS I adopted one as a first time cat owner. Couldn’t imagine getting any other breed. My cat is hilarious, energetic, loving, and relaxed- but is still reasonably independent. He’ll smack my husband in the head at night  [repeatedly]  to go away so he can spoon the back of my neck while he sleeps. Highly recommended! This made me laugh so much. 🙈 I\\'ve come to know an extremely sociable and affectionate grey [i.e. \\'British Blue\\'] friend on my walk from bus stop to church! Large, plump, friendly and talkative! And as the video clip says, a very dense coat. Beautiful cat but my one is not sociable or friendly.  Other people have experienced the same My British shorthair is extremely cuddly @SUE G mine 2 sometimes. But in my life i got like 5 normal house cats, and those are way more a lap cat. I got mine bsh for 6years now and i love him 2 death but compared to normal house cats the bsh has way more a mind of his own. @GoudseKaas mine sits on my lap every night. It will come in time, they ar not lap cats but when they get older they want more attention. And this bread decides when they want attention not like normal house cats who u can call and they come for a cuddle, they really got a mind of their own and thats why i like them. Omg I’m getting a cat soon and I am SO EXCITED!! I wish there was a warning about their hereditary  pulmonary heart problems,, ,we lost our  precious boy maximus on saturday,his heart was enlarged,and clot on lungs,he could not walk ,,we had to let him go at vets,,💔😢omg we re devastated,, I have several.\\nKittens should not leave their nest until the age of 13 weeks, preferably 15 weeks. This is due to the 2nd phase of socialization… 1:46 NOT a british short hair He is like boris cat:artyom I have a British shorthair blue boy, he is a lazy sod lol! He actually acts more like my mums French bulldog! Not like any cat I have been around before lol! I love them and want a girl now a cream girl. You have the best cat videos. Subbed and rung the bell. We just love these cats! We cant wait for our Ted & Chloe to have their babies A Stray Cat? ;) Everything said in this video is the only truth ,I personally have 2 British Shorthairs ,a mother and a daughter @Andreea Diaconu 8 hours??? Why the fuck would you get a cat, if you have to leave it for 8 frickin hours? That\\'s just cruel Leen Selart they can easily stay home alone, I leave mine for 8 hours daily, and she’s not affected at all. They tend to be very independent once they’re full grown Can this breed handle being alone for about 5 hours a day? Or do they get really really sad when left alone? Yes so truth! My Fudge\\'s kittens are now a month old and thanks to this video, I\\'ve realized the bunch have British shorthair genetics in them despite being Floridian strays U forgot brown, i got a chocolate coloured british shorthair.\\nBest cat ever Chocolate is very rare 3:37  LUL I think I found my next pet. 👍 Love the video. The voice is clear and the clips are amazing Cutest cat ❤️ And don\\'t forget, to use English only, when communicate with them!!! Huh? I love then I have one and one crossed with a ragdoll I will be getting one soon. Can any one give tips so enure my home doesnt smell of cat ? Theyr awesome my family and i are thinking about getting a cat i really want one! ❤️🐱 I’m not sure if I own one ... he’s in my profile picture... what do y’all think? Bianca Torrez \\nNope, but that does look like a russian blue! 3:11 Scottish Fold My British Shorthair sleeps and eats all day, she never wants to play lol the main reason I love british shorthairs is because they’re just cute and chubby I have one beautiful British Shorthair named Tilli and I\\'m getting a new one named badger on Friday. @James Mitchell 😊 I  AM JEALOUS  OF   YOU    😎😎😎😎 1:46 min is not british shorthair, it\\'s russian blue Ok so it\\'s clear you got the videos from somewhere then edited them for this one ... when you showed the character of the BSH there was a Russian Blue in the video (1:50) and when you had the Health bar with details , there was a SSH in the video , meaning that the cat in the box could me a non fold SSH . I have a British short hair cat and he is AMAZING he is 2 months old and we have got him 2 days ago\\nHe sleeps well (nearly all day)\\nHe plays well (during the night)\\nAnd he doesn\\'t bites,meows or even jump somewhere he isn\\'t supposed to go.Oh and I live in Bulgaria 🇧🇬 \\nBtw he\\'s called Murphy Murphy Greyblue Cuties 😍 My kitty!!! 😆😙😘🤗 I am so in love with this type of cat but where do I get one? I live in Colorado. I have a beautiful sliver gray color . It’s very rare . I love these cats uhhh taking care of them ALONE is a pain in the ass but it is worth it I own two of these beautiful cats, one Lilac (12 years old) and one silver tabby (13 years old). They are so laid back, and are AMAZING with my young niece and nephew. I bloody love them<3 U can wash them!!?! Its so very cute 😍❤ I just got one. He is the most gorgeous baby ever! this British shorthair kitten are everything! But my favs are still Scottish Fold💜 Annnd I\\'ve just gone all kitten-broody again! My British shorthair is a tabby as my picture displays his name is Winston he\\'s beautiful !! Annihilation Gaming Winston is so handsome How about Tabby British shorthair? what on earth does compact powerful and balanced mean? My BSH sooooooooo naughty! His name is Roro and 5months old. .  Aaa.. eventho i have to clean up his mess everyday but worth it .. 🐈 is LIFE. .. \"The British shorthair is quiet\" ... mine wasn\\'t. he was the most loudest a**hole in the neighbourhood and .. ok everybody loved him. but he was loud. when he was taking a shoot. or.. when he got his food. he was sooooo loud. jeeez i miss that a**hole. Mine too! She\\'s about 6 months now, never owned any pet before so it\\'s been amazing & im in love. But she lttrly yells so much, loudest cat I\\'ve ever met I have a cat just like this one his name is Lucky 🍀 1 other fact\\nThey sometimes act like dogs Coconut Blue British Shorthair is the BEST!!! But my british short hair is so loud and dosent want to play I need one now! They actually live up to 20 years if your cat very healthy but anyway thank you for the information 👍😊🐱 I’ve got an odd eyed white British shorthair called Casper and he is such a lovely cat. Some words to describe him.\\n\\n\\n*so much hair will be shed you will never wear black again* I have a BHS. He is 4. \\r\\nBSH cats are the most unsocial cats I have ever seen/met. \\r\\nAs a kitten they are the sweetest. \\r\\nBut as they grow theire character develops and they get a very very lazy easy going character. \\r\\nI f you tend to adop BSH cat, consider to adop two. So they can be social to each other. Prefarable same sex.\\r\\nAlso male cats tend to develop to have urinary(tract) problems after castration (blood in urine). Avoid Royal Canine for castrated cats. And do not feed them aditonaly/time-to-time with dairy products and dainty stuff (I don\\'t now the correct word, cat-feeding-stuff you give your cat to spoil). These are the main problems causing this health problem. \\r\\nDispite this BSH cats are easy to have around. They are not realy chattty but from time-to-time they complain in a don\\'t-know-what-miauwing. Just complain back. M O omg no way that’s crazy if you watch the latest videos on jet and turbo(these cats) (they’re now 4 years old) you’ll see how playful they are. They’re really good. Best of luck ! mraeece lucky you 😁 all bsh I met are like my cat. My likes to be in the same room lile me but how dare if I touch him. 😁. Up he goes. And water is his enemy. Have a nice day 🙋🏼\\u200d♀️ ohoroa insomnia oh wow mine is around 5/6 and he’s very social he only likes being in the room where everyone is unless he’s sleeping and he’ll follow everyone around the house. He loves being handled and likes baths. He’s a good boy Love this breed! ',\n",
       " 'I have a feeling he wasn’t given HydrochloricQuinn ,zinc ,and azithromycin. @cody isaackson reported Start screening the ELITE who are apparently immune or ALWAYS have a miraculous \"recovery\" and never EVER die... That\\'s because they\\'re not inoculated with the numerous viruses in vaccines. @kevin wynkoop If you\\'re into naked japanese chicks, go right on ahead. Jack Lan I’m afraid to click on it lol @landseyer bro, wtf. Why would you post that here? lovegirl.buzz/dzKTnw3x8IM Going to need a new Michigan Hospital now, they\\'re all infected. All I know is that I don’t want to be on a history chart 100 years from now. Amen to that. I pray that everyone will continue to follow safety procedures until we have a vaccine. I hope the vaccine will be done less than a year or less than a year and six months. Nice. 1 hospital out of thousands. So reassuring.... Not that anyone cares, but my daughter was born there \\n10.02.99💞\\nNever thought I would have her on lock down house arrest 20 years later.\\n\\nStay safe everyone,  even the people who are not taking this seriously. 🙏 He said PERIOD I noticed that lol. My daughter and I say it constantly lol these guys go to the same barber Second one This testing could alter history. Hope it finds the elusive key to combat the virus. @Throy Kydd no problem. I have a good feeling things will turn out fine.  We just gotta let ppl do their jobs. @Max Reilly well it\\'s a stepping stone to open doors for more information. Thankyou for your reply. @Jason K yeah I feel ya. Worldwide 96% of cases are mild and in no need of a ventilator, and 4% are critical and in need of a ventilator. Oooohhhh the Virus...that 99% of people who get it...Do NOT die...100% Fact...why are they acting like 99% of people who get it Die? @Throy Kydd https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/media/immunologist-possible-cure-for-the-coronavirus.amp \\n\\nNow Ik its FOX and I\\'m not sure how you feel about them but watch the video this doctor is very creditable. He\\'s credited with finding a very effective treatment foe ebola. He explains a little bit and I think might answer some of your questions. Well Is anybody cloning the antibodies and testing how they work as a treatment?  I am uncomfortable with the rush of fast tracking. This has been done for 100\\'s of years prior to 1950.  This was all they had back then, until vaccines and antivirals came in 1950.  It is a very safe treatment. All the antibodies do is teach the person\\'s immune system how to make more antibodies.  It should be extremely safe as people receive plasma all the time with virtually no problems.  Stay safe. Can\\'t wait to get some results of the antibody tests.   I took care of a hard core pneumonia patient in January where the docs didn\\'t know what it was and I got something similar a few days later.    Be nice if I knew I was immune and I could take advantage of the cheap travel specials that should soon pop up. There was never a first wave. 25,000 people dead out of 330,000,000 million. This virus is freakin weak in the USA 🇺🇸 @porn theater mop bucket - We, I guess that you really can\\'t argue with dumbass mop buckets. @Hara Lingayan OMG! There\\'s now 30000000000000000000000000 deaths! oh wait...CDC says a cat was walked across their keyboard. We\\'re good. Update... the USA now has nearly 30,000 deaths from COVID-19... the first recorded death in the USA was on February 29, 2020... and 44 days later, the USA now has a death toll of 29,465 people, despite extreme mitigation efforts. Correct! Geo Pipe69 - You aren\\'t counting in factors like lockdowns, quarantines and social distancing methods that we are currently doing to slow the spread of the virus, if we continued on with our daily lives as if there\\'s no pandemic, then more people would definitely get infected and die... the flu kills an average of 60,000 people in the USA per year... while COVID-19 had already killed over 25,000 people in the USA within 3 month of the first known case... and like I said, this is on top of all the extreme mitigation efforts that we are currently doing. 3rd !!!!! HOPE , SCIENCE & GOD . GOD,  Hope, Science lovegirl.buzz/tOJyYK3taOA Can\\'t stand Cuomo THIS CAN ONLY BE FOR THE PORPHYRIAIC BLOOD SUPPLY THEY DON\\'T CARE IF NO ONE BUT THEM HAS A HEALTHY BLOOD BANK App is step one. Next thing you know were living in communist China. Haha Those antibody tests detect who has HAD the virus and so, who is immune to come back to work NOT who HAS the virus and needs a prompt treatment so let ppl die and let’s focus on making money again. It’s too early for these tests as it is too late for antigenic PCR tests! HISTORICAL FAILURE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT. I understand persons who have had COVID-19 and have recovered can donate their antibody rich blood to be used for treatment of others. If somebody big-name and famous would die I would believe that this is the truth but I’m sorry this is all bullshit to try to take our rights away and to write new laws to make this week or as a people because they know if you take the peoples rights away they have more power Those who have recovered and discharged, virus can reactive in their body but deadlier.\\nWhich means virus is already mutating to devour human body.\\nCure:\\nRip. That link you posted, proves nothing. It just goes to show when you reopen a economy during a pandemic it will spread again since not everyone has antibodies. @Trexi Star that\\'s called tissue death. It\\'s not mutating. If left untreated, you\\'ll end up hurting yourself. Studies shows that it\\'s permanent lung damage once a person gets hit hard with covid. @FUCK YOUR LIFE IT MEANS NOTHING  https://youtu.be/A2D5smrXOh8\\nSome Youtube headlines. And the old woman at 0:48 who showed negative after recovering. WTF are you talking about...you are Clueless! 🤣 Where did you get that? If they get infected again, they have a better chance at surivial (immunity). If they get hit with this Covid-19 strain, then they would be in trouble, but it still depends on prelying illnesses. They should ban all travel between states and city’s to stop the spread today there was like 15 people gathering across my brothers house. They don’t look like they were from here every state dresses differently and I think they where from out of town I lived with him for 5 years and never saw them before I wish they would stop comparing this to the Spanish flu.  Yes there are some similarities but a hundred years since then we have made some huge leaps & bounds in science & medicine. Plus from what I’ve read this is virus is a slow mutator... P. L. ODay Yeah you are right, very contagious & deceiving how some people don’t even know they have it... It may (or may not)be a slow mutator, but this virus is a very fast infector.   The rate of infection is high, much faster than other viruses we\\'ve experienced, because it is more readily transmitted. ItS JuSt ThE FLu The Tests are 100% unreliable....I know a lady who took two tests.....One said she had it...and guess what...the other said she didn\\'t have it...and they don\\'t even have a cure......WTF good does a tests do anyway....and 99% of people who get it...Do NOT die....Hell a 96 year old man got socalled corona and Did NOT die....WHY...are they treating it like 99% of people who get it die....HELLO Anybody out there with a brain? NO TEST 4 ME, NO covID, NO VACCINE, NO experiments on me. @HEAVENS STARS It\\'s against my athiest beliefs. Awoman!!! Amen!!! STFU anti VAXXER! The test is a fraud and Beaumont knows it.\\nEveryone will be positive and then they\\'ll round you all up and force you to implant a digital tattoo.\\nThe only people who submit saliva and DNA to the government? CONVICTED FELONS.\\nBy court order.\\nIf you\\'re stupid enough to offer yourself up to them, you deserve what\\'s coming to you. You got that right!!! @Dez Parker You are Correct....The tests are worthless.... I know a lady who took two...one said she had it....the other said she didn\\'t have it.....Waste of time and Money...but...Never let a Crises go to waste...Right! 👌 That is 100% Correct Ladies and Gentleman! 👌 @Dez Parker that\\'s right fez all of us are stupid but you how does it feel to be so superior in knowledge to all us sheeple the aww I feel for you ....sarcasm dum fck \"Trump keeps bragging\" is whats next to America 🤦🏻\\u200d♂ Doctors and secientest  is playing God the they wanted fame name and wanted to be seen taking the place of God The wrath of God is gone out on the land and he is purging the land with his Judgment People looking for answer but God is the answer for a dying and lost world The Cross is the Answer Stfu u religious nut how about one of these infected people cough on you and see when you are dying what you see then. Promoting antibodies, vaccines and even a vaccine chip. But why not use what is available and inexpensive now! HCQ has many positive results,or would you rather believe people whom think they will die and in pain just got better by themselves! This is futile. The virus will spread and kill us all. This will never end. @Dark cadence that\\'s what i said Hey Moron....got some facts for you..99% of people who get it...Do NOT die....Quit making comments.....because you\\'re Clueless! 👌 Not if we keep distance and face covered until the vaccine, the world wont be the same until there\\'s a vaccine.. This Could Never Go Away And be a Aid like Disease Which stay on them forever, Soon The Only Option is to kill All Infection and Stay in side a Extra 3 Months. I agree The same state where the lady governor is being a dictator and not allowing people to buy seeds or gardening supplies or allowing you to buy fresh fruits or vegetables ? Or you can’t buy a American flag🇺🇸 or baby items ? This lady is a CONTROL freak. What does buying a flag have to do with corona? Absolutely nothing!!!! ',\n",

The vaccines is worthless some years. I had the flue 2 times and it was the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. Fever of 104 for 1 week. Within the second week I was fine. Again healthy young individuals will survive unless they have underlying stuff and they don’t know it. @Pen Tester we currently have vaccines and antibiotics to fight the flu and nothing against Covid19 but social distancing to slow it down. As for CDC...I wouldn\\'t trust them under this current administration. Whether one death or 100 million deaths caused by Covid19, the Trump administration did nothing to prevent it from happening till it was to late. Jose Sanchez lies Koka KoKo That’s what the cdc says on their website. Governor newsom please don\\'t do it too soon you should wait until the beginning of June when it gets nice and warm and we can try to get a control on this before we end up losing a lot of people we have a hundred and forty nine cases in Santa Rosa right now if you go too fast I think the coronavirus is going to spread super quick again God bless everyone I mean what are they gonna do, evict 20 million people? Make the homelessness rate skyrocket to the millions 😂😂😂 Yes, please pay my mortgage on my home, my bills for my business, and my employees salaries, thanks! This was plan by them lol u think they wana continue to feel guilty day and night they want to make the process faster and take out as much people they can restart this crook country run by the rich 149 out of the half million people in Sonoma Co.

He is governor Brown\\'s mini me. Between him and his auntie we\\'re screwed.\\n . @Bob Singh That used car salesman is only pimping the illegal immigrants for their vote. I would like to ask him how much money he has lost. He is rich and probably pays no taxes. The hard working citizens are the ones footing the bill. I have worked over fifty years paying taxes for people that haven\\'t paid into the system.  They get free medical, housing, and education. I pay for their children even though I don\\'t have any. I don\\'t care where they\\'re from. I won\\'t be receiving a check. Can I get on television and cry and get a check. If I\\'m going to feel sorry for anyone it will be myself, the homeless vets and seniors that are struggling. Not someone that continues to have children they can\\'t afford. Are you trying to somehow to say YOU care? Cos i think that\\'s a lot less likely Crimson Priest \\n\\nHey I’m a Crapifornian and I despise this fool. Crimson Priest she doesn’t even go hrre How about God Gavin 2024 His slogan will be. I\\'m with Ah.....Hillary had....I\\'m with her. Perfect for a democrat.\\nTrump 2020 landslide :) I think that\\'s real smart considering his track record. He didn\\'t do s--- for San Francisco. Then you gave him the state. Now you what to give him the country. He talks out of both sides of his mouth. He hasn\\'t done a damn thing for the homeless or the vets. But he\\'s pushing to get stimulus checks for undocumented immigrants. He will probably be successful with that because he needs the votes.    This will only cost the taxpayers. I will believe this B.S. when the politicians start writing checks out of their personal accounts. Boycott Democrats/Left/China Trump 2020 Lol yall don\\'t want to deal with china. You just want to blame. And im someone whos wanted policy on china to change for 20 years. Back then it was only the left that knew china was bad news STFU with your idiotic comment. The Republicans should be blamed for everything. Steven Evans Promote right wing killers, White Supremacists and Russia The Democrats/Left/China has created the COVID-19 to try to beat President Trump. Where\\'d you get so much tinfoil these days Exactly She doesn’t even go here! maria manibog China was being financially destroyed by Trump which is why they tried to hide and miss inform countries about the virus. We need to stop depending on China for everything actually we should stop doing business with them until those wet markets are shut down. Democrats as always can’t let a good crisis go and try to politicize it as they do everything else. Pray explain yourself sir?? As long as you support illegal immigrants  and a santuary state for them before our homeless  I will not listen to you ! Mark Gitschel we let everyone across all stars know we welcome homeless and undocumented people.  We want to use our states resources to continue to support them.  The federal government should build a wall on the Mexican boarder and the California border 👌🏻. ',\n",
       " 'you know that the Egyptians actually _restored_ the sphinx............yep, the Shpinx is so old that an ancient civilization had to restore it Or a subsequent ruler tried to destroy it.   Which is evident with most statues having the nose broken.  Then some other ruler tried to repair it in his image.  But what we do know is that the sphinx was built around the same time as the pyramid because of the way the causeway was constructed. The Sphinx was build during the Old Kingdom. Ancient Egypt lastet another 2500 years after that period. So they had plenty of time and reason to restore the old monuments of their fathers. Did we all watch Joe Rogan and Graham Hancock? Cause they proper show facts ae. It was probably made by a some what advanced human or human like race before the instant melting of northern polar ice cap over 12,000 years ago, apparently the Shpinx showed signs of being in water for some time and that would make sense cause ice caps would cause sea levels to rise to a very dangerous level for a time. Ancient Egyptians probably found them there as well and repaired them, a lot of complex geometry was used in their construction.

What about those theories that the Sphinx predates the Egyptians, and that it was first built as a lion by a MORE ancient people, which was only defaced and re-carved to look like a sphinx much later by the Egyptians? Look at the hieroglyphs of the lions laying in the same position as sphinx. You will not find a hieroglyph with the modern sphinx @Peter Bulloch It is true that jackals were regarded as gods in ancient Egypt, but it is more likely that the sphinx was originally a lion as more than 12 thousand years ago it faced the constellation of Leo at sunrise because it is looking east. This would suggest that the Egyptian civilisation goes back thousands of years earlier than previously thought, or it was made by a different civilisation before the ancient Egyptians which would mean that it is less likely to be a jackal. however, I am not saying that it couldn\\'t have been. Actually it was originally a jackal look at the paws those are dog paws not cat paw. @Keith Au genesis...when life was intially created.\\nJesus Christ, perfect in his generation.

If I go to Egypt and I see the sphinx can I say that I built it ? of course you can every other clownhead does The sphinx is way older than what they say here, thousands of years older. @Jeremy Kirkpatrick 100% it is no it isn\\'t HOW OLD IS KEMET ?

Smh HISTORIANS has thrown doubt on the Ancient Egyptians ever having built the Great Pyramids of Giza instead claiming the monuments could have been built by a lost civilisation...\\n...imagine the sphinx... Shaataahp. Dopey lied to Yank Tutmoses saw sphnix when he was young, had a dream that he would be king & he would uncovered sphnix! Sphinx was built by ancient 👽 astronauts 😁 History channel im gonna need you to make a true to the past tv series based on this. Kufu kufu kufu oh brother its not built by kufu but they keep repeating kufu so many times i am almost starting to believe it lol The boat represents the cresent moon Nanna Sin Yahweh on his Return I confess. I built it. That is more believable than the statements in this video. From my research on ancient Egypt, the Sphinx, and the 3 big pyramids were built over 12,000 yrs ago. The dynastic Egyptians found the remains of a pre built megalithic world that the dynastic Egyptians renovated but did not build. The megalithic huge stone blocks with no hyroglyphs were built by giants that lived over 12,000 yrs ago is a big clue that it was built long before the dynastic Egyptians got there only 5000 yrs ago. The dynastic Egyptians built smaller pyramids that today look more primitive then the megalithic pyramids built thousands of yrs before the Egyptians arrived on scene. They said sphinx is 9500BC old. Answer: Jeffrey Egyptians did not build the sphinx, they found it. thoth build it Sphinx gaze keeps track of a galaxy year star constellations Dr.Salima talked a lot and said nothing just as instructed by her higher ups. If the Pharaohs built it , why we didn\\'t find any scripts written on it ???? \\xa0 Danny Hussain that stone only tells the story of an Egyptian pharoah who slept under the already buried and ruined sphinx, he dreamt that the sphinx talked to him and asked him to keep sand of its body and that if he did the sphinx would make him pharaoh, the only thing that stone states is that the sphinx was already ruined before ancient Egypt. Omer Abd Al karim Mohamed Alhusein there\\'s literally a stelea between the paws with writing all over it FALSE. Smithsonian needs to get out of the box! The water wear on it suggests it\\'s thousands of years older, possibly older than the pyramids.\\n\\nI\\'m calling my congressman to stop all public funding to the Smithsonian cuz you guys are attempting to rewrite history with this B.S. story. I\\'m sure your congressman will do everything you say after all you appear to be a world leading expert so why wouldn\\'t he @Locutus You might want to go a step further and ask for an end to lobbying cause it clearly has risen to a level well beyond its original intent.  That being said your comment was completely from left field and strangely focused. @Locutus exactly 🤣 As an ex-Smithsonian employee, i can tell you that most of our funding is considered Trust dollars (including charitable contributions,   non-Federal grants, etc.) Most Federal money goes to paying Federal employees\\' salaries, property management, etc. While you\\'re at it, ask your congressman to stop taking bribes from the NRA. Let\\'s just make our own theory:\\nThere were originally two sphinx. One probably got buried deep down in the sand or probably got destroyed entirely by nature. Since the ancient Egyptians were quite fond of building symmetrical things, the sphinx were originally two; one facing the east and one facing the west. And they\\'re originally lions representing the twin feline goddesses Sekhmet and Bastet (depicting Bastet\\'s original form a lioness before becoming a cat). The two balance everything being the protector and destroyer. Being built closed to the great pyramids they\\'re built there for the purpose as a guardians of the pyramids. So there it is another theory about the sphinx. As my thought that\\'s all and perhaps another possibility.  But am not claiming anything facts about it\\'s just something I come up with since the experts can\\'t give us any proper explanation about these ancient wonders. Smithsonian has no credibility How is this on my feed From 7 years ago.. Also all the information in this video is factually incorrect and has been debunked as the pyramids and sphinx are 6000-7000 years old.. Soooooooo you don\\'t know anything about the subject matter you peasant Amazing video I think djedfre built it since the sphinx killed the elder brother of the prince he promise kingship . Djedfre killed his brother also to become king the mystery seems self solving with relation of symptoms I built the sphinx bihhhhhhhh This story is so interesting 📖 📯👑.  Egyptian history is fascinating ‼ For whom is this theater made??!! I built it , stop asking the same questions How does she know khufu built it was she there when they built it whos watching this in quarintine There is an artesian water level under Giza.\\nThe sphinx has spent 90% of its existence buried in sand.\\nThe Sphinx has heavy gouging erosion from wet sand.

The illusion of the subhuman mind .the same with the The twisted religion \\nwitchcraft  Demons .the 3 eye .all manifestation of a simple mind .. Nice video, still don’t know who built the Sphinx I made it. Hello I\\'m John the alien White Pharoahs before the Ptolemys?! You wish. Only Haplogroup E derived from Haplogroup A from Kenya has blood ties to Cushitic people that ruled Mizrahim for ions. The people of Kush (black pharaohs) invaded Egypt for a short time (100 years) but were driven back up the Nile soon enough.\\nAnd your use of the racist term \\'Mizrahim\\' is uncalled for. Egypt and it\\'s gods were around thousands of years before Judaism. 99% of what they say about human history is BS. Murray you are so right. unwatchable. The alien \"gods\". Keep drinking the kool-aid folks... these are way older... It\\'s amazing how they paint all the pharaohs white when the pyramids  hieroglyphics clearly shows them as black. Another thing before Egypt got the name from when Greece invaded the land it was called ancient kemit which means the land of the blacks established by Noah\\'s sons who were African. Blacks built them long before Greeks came, and that\\'s why you see Egyptians lighter because they mixed their seeds with them. People need to learn history because even India was once called Ethiopia east when African ruled that land long before it got the name, and Greeks mixed with them to. People of India got the dark complexion because of this, and the lighter ones began calling theirselves by different names. That\\'s been going on throughout history. But every human being has African DNA and geneticist have proven that all humans came from black people. @Wendell Hackley but DNA evidence confirmed that the Egyptians were connected to middle eastern people not African or Europeans!!! The Egyptians wasn\\'t white or black they were middle eastern I agree brother @Marilyn King I study real history and languages because Europeans corrupted the original meanings of everything about black history and all humans do have African DNA just so you know truth. The bible is black history not white and if you look at the Greeks and Roman\\'s history they documented the truth about the African nations they encountered and described them as black people. The oldest bones found are Africans and it means a lot for people who want to know truth about greatness of black people,and the knowledge that they had. But Europeans do everything to make it look like they were great, when we brought them out of caves of Europe and taught them to be civilized. Truth must be told... And Kemet means the black soil that once covered Egyptians ground thousands of years ago! It had nothing to do with the color of they\\'re skin and darling we\\'re all human I\\'m sure we all share some DNA gosh And who cares in the 1800s bro was still chucking spears at each other. They never left the tree they climbed out of. Oh wooow BS...... nothing but misinformation what is the garbage! have you been living under a pyramid Reckless Tortuga Egyptians were dark skin people. These secret societies tell soo many lies to confuse the people and hide the truth. Darling your the one telling the lies. The pharaohs were not dark skin. They looked close to middle easter... Smithsonian is run by the Rothschild. This video has so many lies. That\\'s what you would call a slight of hand. To divert the main subject away from the main subject. Who built the sphinx? The sphinx was built over 10,000 ago. That\\'s what some egyptologist believe. How built it Kermit the frog Yeah this is a complete fabrication. It\\'s written on the stela of the sphinx that tut IV found the sphinx while hunting. And that it was buried to it\\'s neck and he uncovered it, then became king Egyptians. take one look at the sphinx head size and it’s clearly been mauled  by a pharaoh How can the precision of the Pyramids be compared to the crudeness of the boat and the same person\\' and his son built both?  His father\\'s creation is perfection his son\\'s creation is so crude?essons. The pyramids aren\\'t as presise as claimed by pyramidiots. It is not exactly true north and the vast msjority of it is softer sandstone, so crudely cut fillers of mud and smsller rocks are needed to fill the voids.\\nImpressive and well engineered? Yes. \\nExact and precise? No IT was built during the age of leo the lion,and the human head was carved later.from age to age we all shall go.From the darkness of masuline man to the light of the feminne woman. Apparently the science behind your conclusion is much the same as the new math. Useless and only serves to confuse. The water erosion alone proves it is much older than your guess  at who may have commissioned it. There is more than one way to erode sandstone. Rainfall is just one. \\nMore than one is not confusing....well to most. The Pyramids got worse not Better  . YES THE great P and Sphinx esp is So I Older . Behind the Ear   that\\'s gone n ow The Blocking!! Stone Anyone who watches this video should look through the comments and discover how outdated this video is... It seems like thier are a lot of amature or YouTube egyptologists in the comment section. Every thing alternative is not true.  look up the arguments against the erossion theory. Dont just hop on every theory. Sorry but the Sphinx is way older then all the pyramids ! Jesus built it! >:[ And like his pyramid there are no hieroglyphics markings on the boat, with his name.  It would be nice to have better pictures of the boat to show what kind of wear marks are evident. This lady doesn\\'t know what she\\'s talking about lies Smithsonian is owned &  run by the dark to steal&give misinformation. Kevin Kincaid, 1909, found Egyptian artifacts in the Grand Canyon, they took his finds, sealed up the cave, & killed him.rEvolution now.

All UFO ship,ancient Egyptian pharaoh keep lot of secrets at heart not to shown to the wold close relation with UFO,ET,one thing very simple King of Khufu is 6mm in modern value ,in fact ,in the world through histories no one in the world even draft is 6mm ,Khufu ship is wood and it looks like UFO,ship not from our planets or galaxy.Those ancient ruins or temples had been existed in ancient Egypt time.those hardest rock are all from Limestone,granite,bed rocks,diorite and dacite and are all megalithic block of stones weight  from 1 to thousands tons of weight,even 20-21th ,all mechanical and electrical engineering tools and crane machine cannot easy to live up ,to move and to push,please look at Jordan ,Petra===The mountain craft as town with modern building structures,Baalbek obelisk ,2000 thousands ,Temple of Jupiter so huge and large similar to Greek ancient temple of Athens,160,000 tons of massive megalithic block of lime-stones.Cusco Sacayhuman,Manchi pinchi,Peru,those polygon wall weight average 125 tons pieces,well crave and engrave the sides of each stones, with unbelievable of inter-locking of stones,similar to Egypt Temple of Valley,hard to make up even 21th technology,therefore,nowadays modern times,not too many people to talk about it due to too mystery,bizarre,enigmatic.Strongly believe a very high-advance and highly high-tech civilization lived on Earth before same stage as dinosaur or giants age or describe as \"Altantic\"lived on Earth before billion of years ago far more than what 19-21t historian saying and depicting what it is the truth histories of the earth,the human being evolution and civilization@@@@@ The cartouche looks fake, and scrawled ,if this was done by a proud son for his father ,it would be splendid artwork as we see in other examples, Same color of fake scrawl in the top of the great pyramid. Hi Those pagans who challenged the most high built them statues and you see they all was destroyed and now people say 👽 👽 built them 😂 😂 😂 😂 Fake - it wasn\\'t built by Egyptians at all as it wasn\\'t mentioned in any of the scrolls. \\nThe only mention there is states that they dug it out :/ Make a good movie not true your story , The worst part is people will believe this. One of the Satan fallen Angels called \"Thoth\" bult it. The pyramids were there many thousands of years before the Egyptians and the pyramid builders were extraterrestrials !!!!! Go feed the bats in your belfry. They miss you! Yes, exactly.  The Goa\\'uld had them built so they could land their ships on them.  Look it up.  There is a movie about it. Lp we are told that the EGYPTIAN civilization had no infancy..if so there must have been an advanced culture that made Egypt its colony, brought their culture and civilization to that land, a culture already highly civilized....and according to ancient records, especially Greek writing say that, Egypt was a colony of the Ethiopians and that the customs and traditions of the Egyptian are Ethiopian by origin, even the writing system was not Egyptian either. Herodotus tell us that the Hieroglyphs were known only among the priest class in Egypt but universal in Ethiopia.......if u got a problem with this statement, then u have a problem with the Ancient Greek writing because thats what they say, thats what Herodotus the father of history said. Link please and dont even think about linking me to one of those non reputable pro black sites that lie They wasn\\'t black The Anunnaki built the Sphinx and Pyramids no an older race did...a race from the south of the Nile river I want to inform the viewers that Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke conducted a secret experiment using quantum entanglement and telepathy to communicate with me. They do indeed exist in another realm and the Akashic Records. I am an interface with GOD/ Grand Galactics and aliens. Although, I have not seen the aliens physically. I talk to the ones that have lost their forms in evolution. This experiment was so secret, that even the United States government did not know about it. Stanley insisted on the independence and secrecy of the project. Namely, talking with the dead and/or aliens. It brings me great joy and pleasure to inform you that the experiment was an extreme success. Thank you. My telepathy with them has verifiable proof on Facebook and I am willing to undergo scrutiny. No other private or governmental agencies have been successful in talking to formless aliens, Grand Galactics / GOD. Wow! That is very interesting.\\nDo you dream dreams too? Lies ,ma granda built that hing back in the 70s it wis part eh his apprenticeship The pyramids were built after the great flood. Then the sphinx, I quote Sitchins book. \"Let us beside the twin peaks a monument create, the Age of the Lion let it announce,\\nThe image of Ningishzidda, the peaks\\' designer, let its face be,\\nLet it precisely toward the Place of the Celestial Chariots gaze,\\nWhen, by whom, and the purpose let it to future generations reveal!\\nSo did Enki to Enlil suggest. To the words Enlil consented and to Enki said:\\nOf the Place of the Celestial Chariots, Utu must again the commander be;\\nLet the gazing lion, precisely eastward facing, with Ningishzidda\\'s image be!(Sphinx) Nubians Nubians were a different race that the Egyptians were at war with south of egypt no just because the nubians ruled egypt for a short time doesnt mean they were nubian They wasn\\'t Nubians @وسناب I\\'m mean Egyptians What do you mean by Egyptians ? Egyptians 5000years later, when ppl found my iPhone in time capsule. They probably ummmm ahhhhh ohhhhhh lol....!! Native  Black  Africans  built  it. Africans didn\\'t build it. The information in this video is very outdated. It\\'s well established now that Egyptians had nothing to do with building the pyramids. They were built by the Ananaki and the Egyptians are taking credit for it all. @Warrior H lie @Count Janus Hassildor THIS IS ACIENT BLACK HISTORY WHE HAVE BUILDT THIS🗣🗣🗣👑👑👑 Thomas Jefferson who are the ananaki?

Ok FDev, you got me. I\\'m slightly less disinterested. @Mhiller Ike since when did Elite become crowd funded. I thought that was star citizen @Derrick M You gotta understands. Frontier Have zero say to actually what happens in Elite because this game is essentially crowdfunded Keyword, slightly. @Jerico Jackson ok. not full development. not that I ever specified how hard they were working on it.\\nHorizons 2.1 was the start. \\nIf not before. What an emotional rollercoaster If you can\\'t gamble in the lounge, we need to invade the pilot\\'s federation. @Chris Dukes It\\'d also mean the game probably gets banned in certain countries. I know Australia has some SUPER strict laws on video game content What if you can bet on player activities like tdms or races, unlikely I know but would be cool That would be cool! They could easily create some parlour games. Only problem, it would immediately make it an 18. You can gamble, but you have to wear a mask and stay 6 feet away from the gambling machine. This looks... surprisingly not shite. Lets hope things look at least this good in half a year\\'s time. Psyanide cool story @Psyanide But where would be all the fun if newbies didn\\'t crash during their first few hours of play? xD ED is far from perfect, we all know it, but people ignore way too many factors when comparing it to SC (on both ends). At the end of a day, these are different games with different things in mind since the conception. One was meant to be space sim with huge galaxy that will take years to explore (ED delivered on that), other wanted to make Space sim when you can walk anywhere including your own ship (and SC is slowly getting there). @Nyx Zorander \\'\\' oh nice, calling people stupid\\'\\' Make stupid claims/statement, get called stupid, that simple 🤷\\u200d♂️ Francisco Martin oh remind us how many planets you have and how much ship pack range from i r l money? It fine bro I’m glad you have the money and the hope for your game. I would rather have an actual space sim at an affordable price with most of my bells and whistles included in large paid update then be bleed dry for ships. Psyanide oh nice, calling people stupid. Salty over this? No way even if I had the money I’m not that gullible. The only part I though was neat about SC and its gameplay was being able to walk into and around your own ship and turn the engine on. I like my games immersive but I prefer them playable and yeah Anthem was a shit show but it was a fun shit show for about a week, that more time than I’m willing to invest in whatever you want to call SC. When you legitimately need to find a skilled pilot to fly ops because the cmdr who jumped into E:D on foot cant make it out of the mail slot. This is going to be awesome. Great video. o7 Citizen. @o7 CitizenAuto fight - \"Corvette with engineered everything\". Auto avoid pirates/griefers - \"Solo play\". @LWCReaper Very Nice!!!! cant wait for auto fight and auto avoid pirates/griefers. I got auto dock computer for that reason Looks pretty much like Star Citizen. I just hope Frontier can manage that the NPCs won\\'t be standing on the seats and benches like they do in SC :) Yeah! @Gorkdork underrated reply🤣 @MCDexX People play the game all the time. The world not loading is not an issue with the game but usually happens when someone is playing with an HDD. SC has tons of glitches and bugs, don\\'t get me wrong. But the world not loading in is a fault on your end. MCDexX yeah, maybe it is because your ass is not glued MCDexX what version were u playing???? Are u dreaming ?? Sc is buggy but not broken like u made it out to be A Multi crew srv would be such a big quality of life update. Being able traverse worlds in an srv and then get out on foot with a friend would be a blast! That or just more than one srv in general, honestly I hate only having 1. @Umbongo Did you watch the video? First person combat, scavenging, data collection, and more. @xSquareback another human beings that play the game with you. Ik crazy right? I have to get those too Evan Robertson correct I’ve wanted multi-crew compatible SRVs since multi-crew launched...which was back in March of 2017 for those keeping track. Now I wonder who will be  the first jackass to fully walk around  a planet :D mark my words, I\\'m doing it. \"In other news, FDev has partnered with Microsoft and Asobo Studios on a yet-unnamed joint initiative\"-The Made-Up Times *starts playing \"I\\'m Gonna Be\" by The Proclaimers Lefty 59th Not complain, accepted. But why praise anyone for wasting an absurd amount of it? @Xenomorphine You are playing ELITE and complain about wasting time? :D :D :D You know what would make this a complete experience? Ship interiors. @KiloWolf Inside of ships will take a long time as they have a Lots of ships now and they have to do each one, space leg\\'s will release without ship interiors that has already been confirmed. They will get there eventually. Just don\\'t expect it with this expansion. It would be stupid of them to release space legs without ship interiors and they know it. It\\'s the single most requested feature of the game next to atmo planets and the major reason people even bring up space legs in the first place I\\'ve no doubt they\\'ll get to it eventually. They had a rough ten year planning from the beginning with preconcepts showing various interactions in or just outside the ship. \"Interstellar\" by definition would be between stars, so if Apex doesn\\'t take us at least to another star system they have a serious branding problem. @Alistair Frith Maybe it\\'s super expensive and limited in range Well I bought Coca Cola specifically for the Coca part, and now I\\'m thinking about suing. Makes one wonder what the in-game logic is for the existence of ships. In a universe where you can teleport from station to station (and presumably materials could also be transported in the same way), what\\'s the point in all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace? Apart from material gathering I suppose. Man, Elite looks more and more like a game I would actually play. But where\\'s the fidelity?\\nClearly those NPC\\'s aren\\'t T-Posing, standing on chairs or glitching through the floor! @ice dan Its the fact that Star Citizen\\'s \"alpha\" phase is going to permanent and what you see now is what you\\'ll get whenever (*if* ever) the game gets a full release.\\n\\nSorry. Haha I know. Alpha means perfect, am I right? I really hope we eventually get the ability run around a burning station on foot and escort NPCs back to a ship to rescue them. looks promising I stay cautious Agreed looks promising but I’m not reinstalling just yet, I have NMS to play for now Yeah, I\\'m just prepared for the shitstorm and try to not get too hyped as much as possible. I\\'ll wait to buy the dlc Good policy. In fact it\\'s the best policy to have with FDev.\\nI\\'ll be less suspicious when they\\'re further along in development and can show me a stream of someone playing it for an hour or two straight with no CTDs or game breaking bugs. Sums up my entire feelings on this game. Im saving my hype for after it comes out and after watching lots of gameplay vids lol @LordRenegrade indeed, just because you can walk, does not mean core gameplay is still just as bad. ^ Wisdom. Military uniform concept art? I can\\'t wait to see all the Admirals/Kings that grinded *courier missions* for their rank parading around stations with their uniforms.\\nJK It\\'ll probably be an NPC only clothing.\\n\\nEdit: Those uniforms are looking suspiciously Star Wars Republic/Empire navy-like. All I\\'ll need is a sturdy vest or jacket with matching pants and a white shirt. And a Wookie. @Widdle Creeps I am guessing there will be a mix of rank specific cosmetics as well as paid cosmetics. They\\'d kind of have a shit storm if they paywalled rank costumes you earned through grinding. if I can\\'t look dashing in a blood red uniform, or a gold and white that\\'s a great style too; what was the point in getting an elite trade rank, and all this cassh, but most likely it will all be pay to get cosmetics so I\\'m already a little let down, going off of how they do ship cosmetics already. I really grinded empire and fed ranks I really hope they offer rank based clothing Bro. The King  uniform should be white/gold/blue energy light. I should feel like a king. Those courier missions wasn’t fun. But can I jump out of my ship with my baseball bat to mess up a Hydra class Thargoid? Dont do that Fdev. Dont give me hope. All one has to do is pay a modicum of attention to maintain hope. Odyssey is shaping up to be great. New Mateo yeah, they are super annoying look like that. Don\\'t worry though. Something will be messed up IF all of this is released on day one it will be amazing and arguably put ED back on top. If all of this is merely PROMISED and meted out over 24 months or bug ridden, it is going to be further damaging to ED\\'s rep. I really am rooting for a proper \\'go\\' this time but track record suggests otherwise. One thing I was hoping for was the ability to have a room on the station or base separate from the ship like in SC and EVE. It all looks amazing! @Vlad McCain  I totally agree... but it is something better than being super glued to a cockpit seat, lol. The problem I have with eve it’s more like walking in a closet. Unless they added more since I last played. I am really looking forward to Odyssey\\'s release. However I really wish walking through the interior of our ships was part of this update. We grind and grind for hours (sometimes days) to get these vessels and all we get to see right now is the cockpit. I would like to see the commanders quarters, the cargo hold, the SRV or fighter storage area, or the crew\\'s mess hall. (sometimes days) my cutter took weeks bro just to get the rank @Harlock Munba I think the same interface is good, not bad, cuz it is just too hard to get used to 30 different interfaces with that level of complexity @Dryzal Mynelli there is still a fact that there will be 3 station interior templates, so, it is much easier to do this type of work. 30 ship interiors are much more complicated and much less related to the real gameplay. Fdev preferred to drop this expansion out earlier\\nI think it will take a while to do all ship interiors, and Odyssey would release half a year later only because of immersion. So we still get a lot of content at the start. If you don\\'t want spacelegs without ship interiors - just act like they did not release Odyssey until they add those\\nUPD. Sorry for grammar, I\\'m not so good in inglish, especially in long texts @Not Very Artificial right, the interface, this is what i meant, thank you @Not Very Artificial magnetic boots.  Lack of gravity in space is no excuse to not being able to explore your ship interior. This is probably one of the most major and most wanted updates elite has ever had. It will definitely change the game forever. I like that they are making it possible to be 100% on foot with NPC taxis transporting you between locations. Maybe now the people who don\\'t play because they find the act of flying ships impossible (nausea / too many control options / dexterity frustration) will join us. And then they will gradually take the time to learn the ship controls after a while. Yeah this. This is what I\\'m hoping for. I have friends who won\\'t play without first person shooter elements Do you think they’ll add bombs to ships to be used in a ground strike? That would be seriously awesome. Catch me making my eagle into an F16E That\\'d be pretty dope If they wanted to allow that, they would allow ships to target surface contacts.\\n\\nBut they don’t.\\n\\nBecause they realised it would mean nobody would use their ‘SRV’ nonsense. @Evan Robertson I mean, there\\'s still inertia, they\\'d move forward after being seperated from the ship (unless you\\'re literally not moving at all, and you can\\'t have a bombing run without running), the only thing that would change would be trajectory. Given the kinds of planets we can visit, bombs would be pointless due to the lack of gravity It would be funny if you could fly over and just drop an SRV out of your ship onto a group of enemies. You notice the conspicuous lack of NPCs standing on chairs? To SC’s defense, we didn’t see npc’s standing on chairs in promotional videos/screenshots either. Only in a live build were we graced with that amazing bug lol lol I was JUST about to post that. \\nYeah, where are my chair NPCs! What kind of spacelegs would this be without glitching NPCs? damnit i came here to make that joke and was too late! @Payperheirplain I\\'ll be honest, I\\'d take Cloud imperiums unrealistic expectations and pie in the sky ideas then frontiers total lack of imagination. Frontier started so strong out of the gate and then just sat down mid track and did nothing. Even when they do implement something new, its half baked. How can we honestly expect walking around to be any more involved then the SRV gameplay, so now we can get out and scan plants? how does that vary from getting into the SRV and scanning rocks? I used to be such a Frontier fan boy, but I learned the hard way to expect less then bare minimum. We don\\'t even get walking around in ships, which quite frankly is laughable. It\\'s only the one thing people have asked for since forever. Competition breeds excellence.  If ED makes SC move faster then both games succeed. I wonder if places like Jameson Memorial would be somewhat different @WHY? ASK?...BECAUSE YOU CAN From announcement to this I am pretty sure that you are just impatient This made it kinda clear that stations are not being changed other than having first person social hubs added Whaooo slow down buddy it took them FOREVER  TO GET THIS FAR now you ask for more?................ok just wait 20 year👍 2:42 \"We have spotted Imperial walkers!\" If elite turns into a star wars game...\\nI\\'m not complaining. It\\'s fine there just basking Aaaaand all the people shouting \"but muh ship interiors aren\\'t there!\" fall silent. Now make Mass Effect style missions a thing and put some meaning into our actions and I\\'m all in Now thats what I\\'m talking about Are people this stupid... or do they know why npcs are standing on chairs in SC? Nice to see the NPC actually sitting on seats (not standing on them). This makes me want to come back to Elite after years of giving up on it. But, then I remember their track record. Almost every game module is an underdeveloped, lackluster activity that only achieved a fraction of what it could have been. Multicrew sent me packing last time. The game is a wading pool that will only get the bottom of your feet wet and, leave you wondering why you even put your swim trunks on to begin with. Also it\\'s guaranteed to be another £20+ upgrade. I\\'ve already been stung by buying the main game and spending extra on Horizons, only to be continually disappointed. The developers essentially sold a Beta game as an official release, and are getting players to pay extra for the game they should have got in the first place. If they had honed the base game so it wasn\\'t a massive dull slog, I\\'d be quite happy to pay extra for these upgrades, but as it is I feel they should be giving this one away for free. I love the idea of having the ground missions and activities that reflect the space ones. If they get it right (and we all know that\\'s a significant if), it\\'ll transform the game completely. I\\'ll reserve my hype for now, though. Seeing shots from both diaries put together it really blows my mind, I can leave my ship for a few years by the look of it! When it comes to space games these days I feel that no man\\'s sky seems to overdeliver with it\\'s updates and elite dangerous underwhelmes with it\\'s updates. @MCDexX when was the last time you played it? I bought NMS on day one and wanted to love it so much, but it\\'s been such a long, drawn-out disappointment. So sad it never lived up to the early hype. :( If I can walk around my ship I\\'m getting it no matter how clunky it is No they said not at launch not on release and no offical news... This might actually be cool. I\\'m intrigued. Keep us posted.\\nEdit: Ohh I think I get it. \"You don\\'t need a vessel to get around the galaxy\". They want to remove the barrier to entry. Flying takes a long time to master or even be half way decent. That\\'s what this is all about, my guess anyway. @Dark Thoughts Interested in both, I just hope it allows for seamless transition between your ship and on foot.  I also hope it is what they say it is and actually comes out.  I\\'m still waiting for atmospheric landings.  The game has so much promise and it just feels like progress is so slow sometimes.  I haven\\'t played in awhile, been waiting for atmospheric landings before coming back.  You can only land on so many airless dead planets before you realize it\\'s just more of the same. @Mhiller Ike Yeah, that is very much evident by your lack or actual argumentation within your comment. @Dark Thoughts If u get elite dangerous for something else other space flight then idk wtf to tell u buddy. Erm, right... I bought Elite because I don\\'t like flying spaceships. I think it is more to address different player types. Like people who enjoy (typical) FPS gameplay, but maybe aren\\'t interested in the space flight. Combined arms in VR would be epic to watch unfold This gives me chills, I can’t wait for this Why do we not get what we really asked frontier for? I wanna walk in my ship ffs Some of the design cues for the interiors are lifted directly from Star Citizen and I find that pretty surprising. From the room layout, the angled windows, seat and plant placement, the weapon shop layout, hell even the stairs look like they could be lower poly SC assets. I wouldn\\'t complain but I already don\\'t think the interiors in SC are all that good. Its just strange. yeah? and Star Citizen has took that idea somewhere else.... Star Citizen? That\\'s one of those old flat-screen games isn\\'t it? I think it looks like very early versions of star citizen concept art as well as some of their demos. Clearly aspirational at best. However their imitation of star citizen isn\\'t surprising? Although what I see so far would never pass as final art as CIG as it is clearly very low-fi. Have you ever SEEN a science fiction film or TV show? Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, Babylon 5, 2001, Alien, etc etc etc. SC and ED both take inspiration from the science fiction works that have come before. If you think SC\\'s visual design is 100% original and not inspired by other things, then you really need to watch more movies and play more games. I don\\'t think FDev lifted from anyone. They never needed to. ED\\'s ten year planning had preconcepts during their kickstarter phase, plenty of corridors and rooms , which could even be seen in the mission board npc\\'s background through the years since ED\\'s launch. Looks amazing... AS LONG AS we can\\'t/don\\'t have to buy all that stuff with real money. That would be a total philosophical change in Elite that nobody wants. Frontier has to keep the playground fair and even for everyone. @Evan Robertson Also the people who didn\\'t buy Elite Dangerous are at a distinct disadvantage to those who did. @Evan Robertson Maybe he meant CQC? Doesn\\'t matter anyways, opinions are like @$$holes. Everyone\\'s got one and most of them stink. Fracarmon ...then why do FDev themselves explicitly state that most people who play the game play it in open? Also, UA bombing (when it was still a thing; shout-out to the Ollo Crew!), is PvP, so your argument is bunk. Odyssey is a paid expansion, like Horizons. I\\'m assuming you didn\\'t include that into your meaning of \"buy with real money\". Frontier would be the EA of space sims hey ! look like star citizen without the bugs lmao. when you have more things to do in a game than in the real world :( Both are the same for me, sit around and play with my joystick Nightspyz1 Yes.. mining. Awesome! I wouldn\\'t be surprised if we get this one and only station interior layout for every station in the galaxy Pay close attention to what they show us, guys. They never hold anything back and always show everything they make. \\nIn all trailers they showed exactly one SRV and that is what we got. \\nThey showed exactly one type of Thargoid ship and that is what we got (granted, there were variants later, but nothing too different).\\nThey showed exactly one fleet carrier and that is what we got.\\nSurely there are more examples that I can\\'t think of right now. So, FDev are really quite honest with their previews - they show exactly what we get, there are no big surprises ever. It has always been peoples expectations that ran wild and in the end people were disappointed because this or that feature they hoped would be hidden before release didn\\'t come. FDev are much too professional to not advertise major features that could draw in more customers. I kind of hope the NPCs in a station also reflect the faction state. So if they are in an outbreak, they will be wearing masks or hazmat. If they are in Civil War, there will be propaganda posters. If they are  at war, there will be more security present. It would be a nice touch that would really give a better perspective to the life of a person living in Elite Dangerous. @Fabian Nunez SC only got like 3 stations anyway and one star system. Nah, Star Citizen has procgen stations already and Elite is the king of procgen. They may get samey after you\\'ve been to a few dozen, but I expect a ton of variety. @Zephius64 Yeah, that\\'s what I\\'m thinking too. There\\'s only so much you can do with procedural tech at the moment. Hopefully some stations will have rubbish/wear or damage, and there\\'s at least 1 room that\\'s different for each type of station. But still, I\\'m happy. I actually didn’t see anything that exciting in this video or the “pre alpha” video. It’s not even gameplay footage really and they have 5ish months to go?? Hmmmmm that’s kinda tricky/ something is fishy. Who wants to bet it’ll be delayed or pushed back significantly like always?? Haven\\'t been this excited for DLC since the Shivering Isles was announced. 2nd thought on the “frontier lines” service  - might be arenas, as in WoW\\n\\nPlease - no engineered suits.... Ok I was hypercritical of them when they announced that stations would be coming before ships for interiors. I may be convinced. Hopefully there is actually stuff to do. So I just had this idea: what if they dont drop ship walking because they want to make interiors modular. as in the modules you fit show up in the module slots. like passanger cabins fighter plane cargo rack etc. That would be a fton of work but awesome and very in line with the aim aspect I personally won\\'t be buying oddesey until you can walk on ships first. how counter intuative can you get I\\'m still cautious, but cautiously optimistic.  _Really_ wanted walkable interiors though, whole other level of immersion.  Also P2P trading?  Not aware if that\\'s in the expansion but it\\'s long overdue. Holy shit, this is going to be a great addition to ED. I\\'m just not excited at all about this expansion. walking around stations: that\\'s not gameplay. that\\'s just added steps (literally) to get to things I can do from the ship menu. walking on planets: ok, so it\\'s like the SRV stuff I can already do, but... slower? so far it\\'s just 2 things that make the already slow-paced game even slower. \"My friend says he doesn\\'t like you!\" wow you pumped this out within an hour of the diary\\'s release Official content creators will get early access to stuff like this. I wonder what this update will do to the sometimes already abysmal framerates within stations. And yes, that is even with recent hardware. Cannot be good. So exciting this and no mans sky and stallaris endless space fun. Having not played in a long time... I can rest assured that at least the sound design will be amazing when on foot. Sounds like X4 Stations.\\n\\nPretty to look at, but empty and soulless. Tbh I was skeptical, but this looks promising. With some good attention to detail they could defo inject huge new life into the game, and I think they\\'re well aware that this is their opportunity to blow star citizen out of the water so hopefully they\\'ll be careful. But to me it seema like that goal is well within reach and not some far flung dream like its been with sc for so many years. So basically if executed properly this could make the game next level and really put fdev on top of the Sci fi game ladder for a long time. if youre able to walk around the sips im gonna be sold i have never been so fast to a OA vid lol same just randomly opened YT and saw a vid posted \"27 seconds ago\", immediately clicked haha Same.. same Players : \"we just want to walk inside our starships\"\\nFrontier : \" We hear you, therefore we give you everything else except walk inside your ship\" Honestly, I feel that OA is a chill for Frontier and that the majority of these concepts will be empty promises. It is about time they added some form of play that didnt involve sitting in a chair. I\\'d like to see a form of play where you can literally avoid being in a cockpit and enjoy gameplay. I\\'m actually hyped again for Elite ! Didn\\'t expect that. I feel like they should\\'ve started with this kind of info before releasing a breathtakingly underwhelming initial video. It actually looks semi OK and something worth exploring. i\\'m really really really impressed with the new stuff we\\'re seeing and the approach - this dev diary was the turning point for me.... now I can\\'t wait! am i seeing Star Citizen looks and ideas :) interesting. I am so interested in what Osyssey has to offer.. I really hope they add a new ship or two as well. In existing games are there ways to easily swap \"on the fly\" from HOTAS to mouse+keyboard or from HOTAS to controller on console? There should be something (cosmetic) that recognizes pilots who are triple elite. Genuinely looking forward to this, really appreciate yours and CMDR Buurs positive outlook on it. Yeah its not bad, but no walking in ships, no money for frontier I was surprised by how not bad it looks.. It had absolutely no \"wow\" factor for me, but i\\'m reserving any hype and still expecting delays Are they trying to keep up and eventually be around the same level as SC when it releases... Looks great. Hope they add walking around in ships and space walking. EVA would be awesome, but I suspect if we get that it\\'ll be in a later content update. yes. EVA would be nice Probably next update. they confirmed they wont do that\\nedit: at least not at launch of odyssey Very excited for this. Just wish it was all VR ;) they\\'re talking about multiple new suits and maybe even modifying or engineering them, but we\\'ve had the same single SRV for 5 years I wander if atmospheric planets like Earth will be open for landing. Though a lot of this looks (very) promising, I can\\'t help but notice that a lot of it seems to look a lot like _Mass Effect Andromeda_ .  Not the inspiration I would be drawing from personally.  I wonder if the NPC demographic range will mimic _Mass Effect Andromeda_ and it\\'ll be a game of spot the endangered white male?  Who am I kidding, that\\'s exactly what it\\'s going to be!\\n\\nEven the APEX element seems like it\\'s been ripped from ME:A.  If you\\'re going to borrow inspiration, at least borrow from the best. This and NMS have gotten me into space games like nothing else has, i wonder what Rockstar could do with something like this. Looks like they copied everything from star citizen lmao Cant wait! Love ED and this will take it to a new level...a great working alternative to SC! I\\'M SO MINDLESSLY EXCITED FOR THIS. New SRVs must be given.  One can hope.\\n\\nActually, one can hope they\\'ve put a fully fledged rescue ship career path in there - I always wanted a good reason to scavenge escape pods. @Barry Fishfinger in terms of lore, landspeeders are non existent and unrealistic. This is elite dangerous not star wars. I\\'d be happy with an SRV that has better storage capacity. All the nuances between how the different ships handle is great. The SRV feels, well arcadey in comparison. I say ditch the SRV altogether and lets have a variety of landspeeders. @Benjamin Menken we should be able to bring them out of status ourselves. @David Knowles escape pods put them in stasis so probably not. I think walking in space stations while neat to do sometimes, will be a little used feature most of the time. Hopefully the hype for it will count for enough purchases and earn back the development costs. They will maybe build uppon it with more activities Wow... They actually gonna do it?\\n\\nAnd EVE Online gave up on it years ago T.T EVE dropped it because it added no gameplay. Elite is going to have you do something outside the ship. I was already hyped for Starfield leaks and now this! I want to hear \"Ok, we were just joking, of course there will be full VR support.\" Let the salty people in the youtube comments do their own thing and \"not play\". For the others however, cant wait to see you guys and have a drink at the bar! o7 cmdrs Your name is sus...I ain\\'t drinking with you lol Lol the bitching and moaning loud minority is the worst part of this game. Sometimes it looks like they\\'re _trying_ to find something to complain about.\\n\\nMe, I keep playing the game because I like playing the game. Any update is just a bonus. o7 See you at the bar! Im totaly in. But im broken right now. YOU PAY! I saw a more \"scavanger\" type of suit so maybe we will get to cut into wrecks? That would be dope as shit, and could be pretty scary, no sound no light only the dead and their belongings floating about. It\\'s funny, the absolute last thing I\\'m concerned about in Elite Dangerous is walking around. Can’t wait to hop in my fed corvette with a ship full of tanks for me and my friends 😂 Release Date: Earlier than Star Citizen. @Richey We\\'ll see the results :) @Ghost Recon Delta17 I do not know mate, can you play it? Ghost Recon Delta17 🤣 Come on, we all know that Half Life 3 will be out before SC releases. It looks great, when you are online, give me a tour of your ship They finished Star Citizen! Oh wait, that\\'s Elite? Niiiiiiice. 😎 Well if these guys pull this off - I for one will be very happy. I\\'m so tired of watching paint dry in SC. Yep, it\\'s good to have options. If nothing else the two games will be similar enough that FDev and CIG won\\'t be able to just cruise any more. Competition is good! Lol why was the bartender capture wearing a Remlok? Is this a \"patio bar\" on the outside of the station? This is what I was hoping for, a lounge area where you can see other player ships come and go. Well at least one game is getting “walking in stations” I hope to god they impliment dedicated servers, especially for ground pvp combat - the game cannot be a phenomenon in the gaming industry unless this happens. I hope to god they do it, it\\'ll make the game grow massively. @Tom Riley Dynamic peer-to-peer is developing (evolving) - like, for instance (pun), when I\\'m out and about in the (real) world some people are \\'in my instance\\', others are out of sight, and out of earshot, beyond shortwave radio comms, etc.. - Layers of instances.\\nI think peer-to-peer is getting fuzzy edges in the clouds. @Magi This is the point of having dedicated servers - at the moment ED is on peer to peer matchmaking which means that there\\'s a limit to the number of players you can have in an instance before it becomes unworkably complex for all the players computers to talk to each other actual server based gameplay would break this. @Aris Vlachopoulos Depends if instances are easily modified or hard coded in a way that is just a torture to change. i dont know if that would work, maybe it\\'s a good idea to have ground pvp in lobbies and just improve instancing, cause i rarely see more than 5 players at once.

Salute to all of them. These people failed to protect us before this pandemic,  all they can do now is frightening us. I wanna hear perspective from the people who recovered @Family Under Attack : I just so happen to be a medical doctor. This is NO joke, take the precautionary measures recommended by CDC and your president - Trump - he is gradually changing his story about this pandemic because it is real. @Family Under Attack Trump first called this pandemic a hoax.   Seems he\\'s changed his mind.    Unfortunately his failure to act quickly and responsibly at the start,     allowed this virus to get a foot hold and spread quickly and across the U.S.   If it were just a common cold,  there wouldn\\'t be so many dying.    This virus is more powerful than a flu.   Once it gets into the lungs,  it multiplies very rapidly and in those who are more vulnerable including even healthy people,   it results in breathing difficulties and lung damage,  some more extreme than others but thousands have already died. @Yu-Ki Hayashi Those you see in the healthcare field on television are criminals and paid actors. They are liars. It\\'s the common cold. They\\'re destroying us under the guise of a common cold. They are lying to you. Be weary of 5G @xxlxpman It certainly seems bad enough.    In New York city,   there are refrigerated truck morgues lined up outside the hospital.    Thousands throughout the U.S have died from Covid 19.   Sadly,  there will be more.   I\\'m taking it very seriously.    I know what a bad bout of the flu is like.   I nearly died some years back from pneumonia after a relapse of the flu that year.     People who\\'ve never had the flu or only ever suffered a mild cold,   don\\'t seem to understand how serious this virus is and can be for many people.    Good for them and I wouldn\\'t wish this virus on anyone.     No one can really know how they will stand up to this virus so it\\'s not wise to assume it\\'s not bad or nothing to worry about.    There have been young people who have said the same and now some of them are dead from Covid.     Good luck and stay well and if you see anyone not practicing precautions such as social distancing,  washing hands, etc.,   remind them of how important that is,  not only to protect themselves,   but others as well. The media attempts to implant an emotional response of fear into you. It’s sick. \"The good thing is I\\'ve never seen people come together like this\".

Give me a break Just like trump saying this is a democratic hoax and now he is saying he knew this was a pandemic before it was a pandemic wow mandela quantum effects exactly different stories smh mandela quantum effects okay, I’m not disagreeing or agreeing with OP’s point, and honestly I don’t know much about this guy’s past claims, I’m just putting it out there. @Elise Eng Yes, HONEST people can do just that, these people, however, are just lying, and they are liars, plain and simple! mandela quantum effects EXACTLY! may god be with all of you and your loving families 🙏🏼💫 May Allah bless and protect all human being InshaAllah Ameen. And HOW would they know this... because they are doing it. Exactly commonsense Pray for the whole world.🙏 Pray for us all. God bless us all. We will all get threw this. “This will be like war”\\n\\nWhen I walk down the street to buy beer at the moms pops shop, the same guys are dealing meth and crack right across the elementary school. \\n\\nEh, things look the same to me. @Brian Hammond Have you been to the South, The Midwest, or Appalachia? Looot of toothless tweakers compared to the northeast and west coast. \\nSure, crack is a thing in large cities / urban areas that Democrats tend to control, but you\\'re kidding yourself if you\\'re equating crack/meth issues with liberalism. Brian Hammond lol they’ve been there for decades. It doesn’t matter who controls the town. We’ve had leader from both sides. Now stop pushing your political agenda and go wash your hands. Must be one of those democratically controlled towns then. Good Bye me too \"as long as my personal little corner of the word hasn\\'t changed, everyone else is wrong and things are the same\" I’m essential i have to go out. In wartime people need their prosciutto. Thank you for taking care of us while exposing yourself to germs just so we can eat. And thank you to all Restsurant & grocery store, etc workers who take care of us who aren’t in those job positions. It’s greatly appreciated. Bro, pick me up some Nutella and 45lb barbells. I\\'ll throw in an extra $20 spot And Penne, and Bolognese, and Cannoli! god bless us At least let the dude explain what are some of the good things he’s been seeingz 9/11 or Pearl Harbor moment? Where we are betrayed by certain government officials? Ruben Gonzales In the words of someone else, this isn’t a 9/11 moment. 9/11 was a surprise attack on the World Trade Center. This is our Chernobyl moment, a preventable disaster that was downplayed and mismanaged till thousands were dead. Ruben Gonzales 💯 We all need to come together (metaphorically) to stop this pandemic I live in SC 😭 I work in retail (home improvement) we are not closing. The store that has those customers are coming to us.... we are now busier than during the holidays.... it\\'s totally disgusting 😷😭 *Tonché* *Tonché* I literally just quit my job at Walmart today. The manager told me I didn’t need to wear a mask and stop “following up everyone” like wtf ? Easy for her to say when she’s forever in the office. \"Don\\'t group up outside of work but working with 20 other people in close proximity is perfectly fine\" mandela quantum effects did you take your meds today? @Con Pop To humans. No. To me. Yes. And that\\'s all that matters. @Buck#00 Yes. Thank you 😊 @Tasha Glam And that is why humans are sad. @Nathanael Addison It\\'s a lose lose situation. Reporter should wear her mask. Ain\\'t doing any good wrapped around her chin maybe she took it off so that we can hear her clearly. u think? Her job is to spread panic, not helpful information. If reporters not wearing mask, means its not serious People are less likely to trust a speaker if their face is covered. That is why none of the government authorities choose to wear face masks. And why aren\\'t the Liars in Chief wearing masks?? They strut around at press conferences totally unprotected. There is no deadly threat. That\\'s why. LORD of hosts, please have mercy on us ALL. Be safe everyone, take care of each other. By GOD Grace and Mercy 🕊 How can they predict the worst week yet? Because they are causing it.... Thank you! Commonsense, this is like a game to them. @MC Grindah I like what you\\'ve been doing in this comment section. Because you can draw comparisons to other countries and make predictions based of the previously observed infection rate, it\\'s really not that hard to wrap your head around conceptually. I am the Resurrection and the life, he who believes in me will live even though they die Jesus said. \\nWe are saved by grace through faith. \\nAnd faith comes by hearing and hearing by hearing Word of God. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 KJV, NKJV 🙂 How do they know when the moment unless they put this virus out there I don`t governments make me understand That\\'s exactly what they did It\\'s hard to understand what you\\'re saying, but the predictions are based off the growth of the infection rate in other countries. It sounds like their about to pull the trigger on something we’re not expecting. 👍 Another falseflag is coming to being in the 2nd phase of martial law. Exactly We were attacked at Pearl Harbor and 911 was an inside job so yeah, you’re exactly right!! @david Bouras Hoi have ALOT to learn if you dont know. Lmfaoooo they just telling us everything at this point Sure and the moons made out of cheese and the coronavirus was caused by one bat and sure its all chinas fault and sure we all gonna die someday do why not today How was 9/11 an inside job? Kurt Cobains Shotgun best comment🙌🏾 My job: what outbreak. Lol I\\'m working 12 hours too it\\'s great Now that the restaurant I work at is doing carryout only I\\'m working double the hours I previously did I hope you are doing ok. They closed schools and they opened the beaches in my mind it does not compute. Probably because maybe they’re going to start activating those 5g transmitters. These devils will answer to God There\\'s no evidence of that, but you should be concerned about the EARN IT Act which is going to ban end to end encryption and be the death of digital privacy, currently under review now. 1:00 Docs got 2 brand new I phones on his desk, unrelated, just saying Haha..I noticed that too 😜 Guess Thanos is still snapping his fingers. They made that movie for a reason. @Let’s pray and fast together oh and does this same thing happen in other religions or is Christianity the only one that matters? @Let’s pray and fast together hmm well someone else said the bible says 1/3 of the population goes...I wonder which is true Blood Demon yes they did. He mocked Jesus Christ. Half of the world disappears or dies. In the Bible 1/4 of the population dies in the 4 seal and in the rapture many will disappear. Hollywood is just trying to prepare you guys. But did he do a step after? Perfectly balanced as all things should be. May everyone and there Friends and family’s y’all be safe God bless you and blessing good health for all we are going to get through this Amen Heidi Canterbury that’s not the point but okay. You too. @sxrenity lol. I understand that you are confused and contradict yourself. Have a blessed night Heidi Canterbury so apparently you still don’t understand so I’m just done here @sxrenity you don\\'t need to break down your whole thought process like I can\\'t understand, when clearly you don\\'t understand what you are even saying. You just said, \" I think we can all pray and it can be helpful sometimes,\" yet in your statement above, you said, \"praying won\\'t help.\" Clearly, you are confused. Praying helps whether you believe it or not. Maybe you should spend a few minutes reading or listening to testimonies rather than the fear-mongering media that has you thinking \"we\\'re in too deep.\" Like, the 95 year old woman who overcame coronavirus and said she felt the love of Jesus and knew her family\\'s prayers saw her through it! As of today, coronavirus has killed 75,945 people worldwide and 10,993 in the US. The flu has killed 291,000-646,000 people worldwide and 12,000 to 61,0000 in the US. I\\'m not minimizing the coronavirus but those are the facts. Regardless of statistics, Jesus is far bigger than any flu or virus. He does answer prayers. I am living proof. He healed me of an incurable illness that doctors have no answer for; other than, \"it must have been a miracle.\" Again, God does answer prayers but if you believe differently, maybe keep it to yourself rather than spreading your negativity! Think of others and what they may be going through right now! Heidi Canterbury okay I’m just gonna explain my whole thought process here and hope that you understand. I think that you all can pray, and it can be helpful sometimes! I’m not saying you shouldn’t pray. I’m just stating that I personally don’t believe in prayer but you totally can! I don’t care what you believe in, as long as you want to pray that’s fine with me. And by “we’re in too deep,” I mean that the death rate is growing so fast and so many people are getting sick and losing family members that I personally don’t think prayer is going to help. But if you do, then you do! I’ll bet Aliens are flying around in UFO’s like crazy and they want us to stay in so we don’t see em. The aliens saw our empty stores and went back home. OMG add that to the paranoid bucket list!! Those aren\\'t aliens. Fallen angels. Don\\'t buy into that narrative. I bet Robin Williams is one of them UFOs saying nanu nanu. 👽👾 In America where most people live paycheck to paycheck. Who can afford to stay home for a month? How long will this last? If you don\\'t pay rent. You will now have to worry long about paying rent cause you will be living in a box. Chungus Gamez maybe not all around but in the US it is at least most parts... Greed is definitely like the biggest problem besides the virus in general greed and stupidity WcKd cysin but it really isnt that simple you look over this odd human trait called greed. Greed is an ugly thing and it can make people blind to what must be done. I dont disagree with you but it wont happen all around because greed its simple. Chungus Gamez it’s so simple to understand and it’s literally what’s happening no one is expecting rent money etc stay in and worry about money later Chungus Gamez Ok and, everything is being postponed till later you don’t pay rent until later and there’s a law that they can’t evict you... companies etc are proving free services for now to help like so phone lines are giving free unlimited data for a while. The only thing people need money for is food and water and that should be fine because you won’t be paying rent till later. Why is that so hard for you to understand. People will be losing money the economy will take a big hit but that’s better then dying of wuhan virus. Please continue social distancing 🙏🏼 More like \"Our spanish flu moment\" As a famous devil hunter once said, “Same crap, different day.” Thank you,tired of it all.H1N1 was more than twice as bad and nothing was shut down,it wasn\\'t even talked about!! @BLACK BULL what a loser. Lol Obi Wan Kenobi https://youtu.be/mhqh0BZkbxA Exactly!! Wasn\\'t expect to see a devil may cry reference here lol essential employee is just a pc way to say expendable employee. Time to stand together as a country! 🇺🇸 I swear i have read this headline like 5 different times each a different day Exactly Just watching had  me thinking I couldn\\'t breath Already been in quarantine for 2 months. What\\'s another week? Boris Sheen Oh definitely; It’s a introvert’s wet dream. 😏 Just Dog u mean another month it 2 @Boris Sheen coming from an introvert, absolutely @condorX2 Well hopefully they die so when we go to the hospital we will have a bed. @Yurddd I guess we\\'ll be seeing you soon saying \"guys we should take this seriously\" next. Like all the other idiots. Humans don\\'t deserve.... There is more to this story than is being told How much more lies are left ??? @Maugradeum, we probably got it from bats so that cross species thing ain\\'t nothing new. @Maugrade We already had a dog got infected and died after they released him home. A cat just got tested positive too. We are in Hong Kong.😥 A lot, but it is all on the China side. The USA is playing with half of a full deck and still is trying to find out what is missing. A tiger was diagnosed to have COVID, making it a cross-species plague that could potentially make vaccines irrelevant if it infects an animal like a house cat. What about those of that at work in grocery store? Maybe, just maybe, it didn\\'t apply to you. Of course Arkansas can’t stay home. It’s Wal-Mart Headquarters essential jobs I have lived in Arkansas 33 years , make 100k, and OWN 2 houses! A law banning end-to-end encryption (the EARN IT Act) is currently being reviewed. It\\'d basically be the end of virtually privacy, and you guys are still patting yourself on the back for thinking it\\'s from 5G or the government is trying to hoard groceries instead of actually acknowledging a factually existing bill. Everyone is contradicting everyone else.  \\nNo one knows what they\\'re talking about.  \\nThey sure know how to sow fear with a soundbite. @mandela quantum effects STFU, schizoid conspiracy theorist. I\\'m sure you think the Earth is flat too and believe in \"chemtrails.\" And Bigfoot is your next door neighbor. @ken kleck same here, these are the same people that don\\'t follow the mandates. I get a lot of them and I just want to kick them out the door, then again does it really surprise you @mandela quantum effects it\\'s possible but I make sure I have evidence before I go around calling serious matters fake ... @D Vez But Sa\\'shanna is right. These guys are lying, this is all fake, and its all about  our rights, and their one world government, and it isn\\'t about anything else, this so called virus is just the shining spinning ball you are supposed to be looking at. @ken kleck Or maybe there\\'s 10 other aisles of food, and zero other aisles of Lysol...? Like she\\'s obviously being a Karen, but it\\'s perfectly reasonable to prioritize Lysol over whatever food item he was stocking at that moment Kind of sounds like they have a plan right? How do they know what next week holds? They know because they write the narrative. People are dying, I understand that, but stop being scared and start questioning things instead. Nick Rivero THAT PART!!!!! Exactly! \"this is the moment to not be going out to the grocery store,  not be going to the pharmacy. \" IDK but that lady must not understand that people need things.  I get it, to not spread disease,  but it\\'s easy for her to say that with her doctor money. Our government is running around with their heads chopped off. END OF TIMES This happens with every major disease. the spanish flu was never contained, and COVID will not be contained. We need to slow it down until the vaccine is in production to avoid the 100 million dead globally, but at this rate it is against the clock. we need a vaccine in the important places before September if we hope to slow it enough. After all of this is over, tell Miley We Need A Party in the USA!!! Meanwhile I’m just sitting here getting stoned @I Cap dam u on the DL  playa Ya make it a fat one Drew P Knutz \\n\\nDo they have mail order?\\n\\nJoke. \\n😸 This whole months is 4/20 Weed, just like smoking cigarettes will get your lungs compromised. Gl “GOD BLESS AMERICA” Saundra Wills explain your statement @Chungus Gamez \\nNo ur history!  🕊 Marie Ynostrosa jesus never existed You cant god bless america because there is no god Marie Ynostrosa “Amen my Sister 2:02 I agree that’s 💯% ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!! No school, no graduations for graduates, no prom, no church, no proper burial for families but you can open beaches for hundreds. WTH!!!🤨 Cherrykah R 🤦🏼\\u200d♂️🤦🏼\\u200d♂️🤦🏼\\u200d♂️ They say this every week...time to get back to work ...and stay safe and distance yourselves...if you need to stay home do so but the government doesn’t pay my bills.  This guy saying to stay home for 30 days gets paid either way... @ALoveS S Thank you for the tips. Stay healthy and safe too. While I agree, the reason they say this every week is because people are not listening and it’s causing a surge in cases every week. Look at the numbers! And the scary part is that they’re probably undercounting due to lack of testing. At this point it is tough but I would rather have my life and health of my country than work. H M do what’s best for you. I’d say if you can take off your outside clothes before coming inside in your garage in your car in your laundry room keep a rob in a separate bag a trash bag for out side clothes and was ASAP. and take a shower when you get home before family time it also will help to relax you . Stay healthy stay safe! @tari813  I guess my anxiety comes from working with the public and handling cash all day and then having to go home to my 2 young boys. I sanitize myself and car before going home but there are moments that my anxiety kicks in and I wonder if I am doing enough to protect my family. @tari813 Hey I worry but I still go to work.😁 Love you ❤️ every single person out there! \"There\\'s a surge in applications for the National Guard.\" Yeah, because there are no jobs and people are about to be evicted. Joining the Guard guarantees you 3+ months of basic and AIT.  ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I was the first to say Trump\\'s wall was to trap us in USA wheelbite14 https://youtu.be/mhqh0BZkbxA @Flick so does rent accrue during that time or\\n\\nHow is anyone going to pay off $10,000 in rent, in one payment, with no job Darn straight Bill gates predicted this wayyy back in 2014. He was right. Bill Gates has positioned himself expertly as some kind of \"world health expert\" (but all he focuses on is vaccines), he OWNS *all* the chess pieces involved in this crisis (patents, relationship with WHO, foundations, etc., billions can buy you a lot), and he wants to inject some mystery substance into your body and our children. Watch his TED talks, he says FROM THE STAGE, his goal is to *LOWER* world population by 10 to 15%. You decide… @Matt Smith exactly He was behind it \"predicted\" The new surgeon general is clueless. they are only WHEELBARROWS FOR THE BIG PHARMA MONEY I\\'m officially not having a good time Oh wow do you have to stay inside for a few weeks to a few months, you poor thing... Haha get over it But Fox \"News\" Told me everything was fine, they are even encouraging Trump to \"Open\" the economy and allow business as usual to continue. Who do I trust? Trust no one. look at the math. This is bad and going to get worse. Prepare accoringly. If things get better, at least you will have an extra can of raviolli in your cupboard. Okay so when they say \"next week\", are they talking the week of the 5th or the week of the 12th? Price Tatum that’s what I wanna know Does this mean this week? The 6th-11th? or the following week? Karina N. This week and next week are projected to be the peaks. The projections they are using are available on “healthdata.org” and you can look at the information for your state specifically on there. Keep in mind that many states have not been properly testing and so the numbers and projections may be off. Never listen to the same morons who got you in it. Finally admitting they are struggling. 1:52 sadly that is my governor It almost sounds like they know something we don\\'t know. \"Don\\'t go to the Grocery Store, or Pharmacy\" Something about that one sentence, gives me the creeps. Just sounds like government control to me @Ann Young 👍 I saw a video where a reporter asked Trump why people are still allowed to go to grocery stores as if Trump was wrong @First Last go again.  My wife just got back from an ultrasound. She told me plenty. @Family Under Attack Go yourself and see. This is like a repeat of the 1918 influenza pandemic..good god. Social media distancing is a good weapon! Unless you get sick and die, how would next week be the hardest moment of anyone\\'s life? The sensationalism is ludicrous. @MC Grindah  You tell me, what do they mean? What is going to happen next week to make it as relevant as 9/11? @Peoples Hernandez How are you quantifing \"impact\"? How are you missing the point of the analogy and quoting a number three times higher then the deaths of 9/11 and not getting what they meant. @MC Grindah we\\'ve had around 9000 deaths since the beginning of this crisis. How many deaths have to occur for this to be a weekend similar to 9/11 in terms of impact? Maybe having a loved one die...? Two minutes of telling us how bad it\\'s going to be, last ten seconds they tell us that they are returning hundreds of ventilators. That\\'s a big mixed message. @MC Grindah that\\'s not what they said, though. Are you unable to process how one area may be able to send back ventilators, but other areas or the country at large may not be in the same position? It\\'s really not complicated. Sorry but the Japanese didn\\'t give America 3 months to prepare for the attack...corona did. @Austin D you mean AL-CIA-DA Neither did al-Qaeda when they decided to dive-bomb straight into the world trade centers Zack Is here :P what do u mean by the words “all you people “... do u wear a red hat...it’s an act of war in my opinion.. read between the lines or lies which ever u prefer....this is global and the chinese government unleashed this bio germ.... @Paul Benoit There is no vaccine and there won\\'t be for the forseeable future. @Niko Gambino  Far Far too late.  Even the slow UK was 2 weeks ahead. This surgeon general seems like he\\'s in way over his head, like most trump appointees. I\\'m sure he\\'s a nice guy, but he\\'s scared and not up to the challenge, and we can see it. Michael Strong Bow I wanna see what you would fcking do when your handed responsibility over one of the worst pandemics since the Spanish flu, that no training could have prepared you for. Eisenhower was a military tactician btw, not a fcking surgeon general. @Michael Strong Bow hes too nice.. Exactly what I was thinking from his first speech sense this virus. He\\'s too nice, we need a stern take no BS  S.G. that demands the people and it\\'s state govs to listen.  We need an Eisenhower and we got...….this guy(he\\'s in uniform that\\'s why I\\'m comparing him to D.D.E.). Listen to him, though. As afraid as he may be, he is doing a good enough job. COVID-19 is a 9 out of 10 on the severity scale of pandemics. It is literally a worst case scenario. no one was prepared, and everyone is in over their head. China lied, and people died. yeah I really don’t see how you could have predicted this 0:25 I\\'d like to know why they don\\'t get sick, if they never cover their mouth and don\\'t keep the social distancing @Anna He deleted his comment lmaooo First Last: tell that to the doctors and nurses :) pos @First Last idiotic you must be They are social distancing i think theres only like 4 people in the room idk though \"IT\\'S OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAND!!!!\" \"Do not to the grocery store, do not go to the pharmacy...\" So, do I stay home and starve? Do you always take \" tv advice from a stranger \" ? Did your mommy fail you that bad? ..... stay home.... lol ',\n",
       " 'I SMELL AGENDA!! Who would\\'ve thought that some of the poorest communities in a society are the most affected by a pandemic. @Trey 1 such ignorance what an idiot\\nsleepy joe @Max Hardcore 😂😂😂 @leicanoct I didn\\'t disagree that blacks aren\\'t prone to hypertension, they are. Im just saying that whites are prone to certain illnesses too. But they don\\'t mention that. Its racist crap this turd is speaking of. No place for that right now @madeleine romulus they pay robots?!?! What are they spending the money on? Lubrication, oil and batteries!!! You said you wear a wide brim hat remember. I was just wondering how it protects u from the virus @Max Hardcore btw, what do you mean by \\'wide brim\\'? is it another derogatory term i am not familiar with. your name sounds like a chinese bot. are you a fake human. i heard they are pais 35 cents per post. He sounds like Mike Tyson Look like him too oh you are much smarter than i. please tell me. 😢 He has a lisp 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tyson\\'s voice is an octave or two higher. Only in USA the covid19 virus chosen it victims based on color of the people..it actually should be based on whether they are poor, rich, or educated people..rural or urban..that the point..not based on color..lol @Pliny 830 our immigrant communities can all still receive public medical care, if you\\'re one of those arguing they are only there to get welfare, obviously they aren\\'t working and are staying at home where it\\'s safe 👍 ppeople black or whatever classification should be curious as to what is going on around them and be responsible for their onw safety. mostparents, mothers arent aware that children are kidnapped. when i tell them to be careful they classify me as weird and paranoid (i am childless). same with COVID19, we should watch what s going on and react. when in doubt do without meaning take precautions before the mayor and gov make their political decisions. @madeleine romulus  Yea rich spread it to poor people eventually but early on it was predominantly rich people who were sick with serious symptoms. And no one was saying anything about those demographics back then. Just like there\\'s no one talking about men being the predominant victims, even though the ratio of men is likely bigger than the ratio of minorities. @Gorky D the thing is, the rich people bring it to everybody. the most spread here is from a ski resort. 1000 were contaminated from that tiny exclusive joint. they took it to a hospital, and to other country. Shankapuppet I guess the same reason Europeans have sex with their cousins 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️. Doesn’t covid-19 kill more men than woman? Wont hear much hoopla about that one. @Mark McPherson Rolaids may help ya , 🐑💩  🤦\\u200d♀️ There has been a lot of articles on this lol Hospitals get 39k from the Govt for every covid19 patient that dies in their hospital. No they wouldn\\'t do that would they. @Mark McPherson WELL , Aren\\'t you FUKN Ray of Sunshine & optimism...Jeez Man , Bake some Cookies it soothes the Spirit, Speak encouragement to family & Friends is important \\nKEEP HOPE ALIVE,  ✌🙏4🇺🇸🤠✊ Yes it Does Predominantly. His statements would be much better received if he just said pre-existing conditions make recovery from covid-19 less likely. And then just stop talking. All the big mama, abuela, pop pop talk is unnecessary and frankly sounds like gibberish. That how he talks to his family fine. But he is speaking nationwide and a professional should know the difference and act accordingly. @Stephen RunsHisMouth He is the embarrassment. Most Black people understand he works for \"masta\" and just a joke. And he decided to be part of the white society he is really one of yours. I hope you understand that both Democrats and Republicans are the SAME people. @Review Sam you\\'re just embarrassed because one of your own made yall look like fools on national t.v. Not that we didn\\'t already know that anyway😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂MAGA @1bikeman OnDaMoV 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Mark McPherson I understand about connecting with your audience but hes not connecting here with these 1918 stereotypes. Its racist to suggest that how you need to reach us.\\n\\nThink about it, you really think people listen to him sounding like this? McQueenPress Ok. Cool story bruh. Don’t doubt it. Diabetes correlated with COVID19 death. Not opioid addiction. Thinks like obesity, heart disease, lung disease also correlate with COVID. Any group which has problems with those things, white, black, male, female, alien, human needs to be aware. And any individual with these problems need to be more careful. I hope everyone can stay healthy He coughed without covering his mouth. I farted without opening the window Darren Rushworth-Moore still should have covered his mouth Bro to funny, what\\'s is he supposed to cough into his hands and spread his germ\\'s every where dude is at a news conference everyone is more then six feet from one another totally safe distance now if he sneezed that\\'s a different story and sneeze can travel up to 20 feet and you\\'re supposed to cough or sneeze into the fold of your arms not you\\'re hands. MythBusters 101 Darren Rushworth-Moore  exactly and then he shows us his inhaler!!!  I’m asmático as well and I get looks all day long Wasn\\'t really a cough he cleared his throat which can be a habbit or a underlining health issue. The virus ain’t racist.\\n\\nDeath does not discriminate @41maddriver bite them how? Manu patients are very overweight.is there statistics about it ir only on videos @Tough titty P Diddy \\n\\nThat\\'s regurgitated rhetoric for every so called illness of black people.  Have you ever heard the term \"the truth is in the details?\" He is mixing truth with lies and if you\\'re not a critical thinking person, you won\\'t catch it or bother to.  They have been advising these hospitals to mark ill black people as COVID without any testing, no matter what.  There\\'s more to this.  Tell yourself this, when the virus supposedly hit the USA, it hit hard in Washington state. Then, California.  Afterwards, it hit hard in the tri state area.  Yet, all of a sudden, it doubled back to MI and decided to hit ONLY 32% of the state that happens to be black, in urban areas and large cities.  After that, covid took a bus down to LA and skip everywhere but where black people were.  Then, it said \"you know what, let me go over to Baltimore.\". \\n\\nCOME ON MAN THINK!!!! jay W he explained in this video why it’s affecting POC more. No, but the US does. Its been happening for centuries. People in poorer areas of certain states, have shitty heath care, by design. Do your research. Thanks\\n#SegragatedStatesOfAmerica Because \"they\"want it like that, it is all planned.Like all the CEOS walking out at the same time. He sounds like my uncles partner . we need to bring more fear to the people!! 0:52 when he coughed it gave me a heart attack and CNN would call that covid 19 related. He\\'s quite cute! Sturgeon General?\\nSomething smells fishy!!! @Jc Stang i never said affirmative action is right. i think is dumb. i just said if the shoe was in the other foot it wouldnt be right. @ArchangelExile \\nI don\\'t know why they don\\'t know a sturgeon is a fish. I think it\\'s pretty humorous!!!😁 @Richie Christeleit \\nYou said it! 😁 @Kevin Tse your statement only sounds good if you believe our government doesn\\'t hate whites and also if you believe all the trash propaganda coming out of this stooge\\'s mouth. You\\'re pretty naive. \\'we want to take care of all our people but especially blacks\\'. That\\'s called special treatment. They\\'ve been transferring and asking for more resources for blacks for ages and then when the virus comes out they says \\'oh no, blacks are affected give them more resources!\\'. Even a child could figure this one out. It\\'s like the UN, \\'oh no the corona virus we must have green new deal now!\\', lol. Jc Stang that is racist.  By all indicators Adams is an incredible doctor, a brilliant orator and he cares about the American people.  He was appointed by Mike Pence in Indiana and then Trump for Surgeon General.  None of that points to affirmative action. When is someone going to call out this virus for being racist! @sino wino you\\'re stupid @rci kaal??? @Jamie Jay no just another seal that its leftie and race hustling masters throw a fish at and he claps and barks for them repeating word for word what they say. @wolvieguy Its amazing how stupid sino wino is. You cannot use logic on these low end types. They only seek victimization. @SD Man Thirsty D.C. I know, I assumed people would see that the comment was ridiculous. Sadly, it went over a few heads. Somebody come get Clarence Thomas son. @loolikyl0005 Right he\\'s in the sunken place. Look at his wife. @loolikyl0005 I\\'m sure he recognizes that he is black more than you recognize that you are ignorant. Lool 😅😅 Does he even know he is black or he decided to hide all the mirrors in his house @41maddriver Is Bigger Long your granddaddy? CrimsonTide. Is your daddy Bigger Long? America\\'s challenge\\nThe intensity will be removed @Paintmeyellowtonight\\nSexy @Paintmeyellowtonight\\n؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟ topgirl.buzz/kT8wPs8O9vV To be honest people in NY got hit harder due to the fact some weren\\'t taking this seriously because they are just to cool for that. Heard about families ignoring the warnings and having birthday parties for their children.  We did what we were told by our State and local governments at my home. Alot of people black and white didn\\'t do this right.. Now is not the time to blame, but time to do what we can to help stop the virus in whatever capacity we are able to. Lol Darwinism @Paulina De Luca , by overall numbers Caucasians are dying more than any other ethnicity!!!!! they have the weakest immune system, don\\'t believe me?? go stand in the sun for an hour and see what happen!! @@Gorky D , and trailer parks are mostly Caucasians, sharing the same needles/same meth pipe but they don\\'t get sick!!!!! ok get you @David d your post has alot of air And who was the one saying that it would disappear in april and was not serious? they have to pay rent..and were not help to support themselves to isolate....well potus said he didnt like the migrants..this was a way to left them exposed...a normal president would have said ok take mask..ok if not absolutely critical self isolate we would give you 300 a week... What percentage of healthcare workers are minorities? 🤔 Those are really the people who are socially predisposed. EXACTLY CDC 2 Months ago: Don\\'t wear masks!\\n\\n\\nCDC 2 Weeks ago: You need to wear a mask! Right. I said the same thing when they said that and thought they sounded stupid. I been got my mask. @Jordan Melby Vlogs yes and nono..if the use of surgical  mask would have been mandatory, as it prevent the difusion of droplets  there would have been a mutual protection...IF they would have made them madatory. if its not only the n95..but the surgical mask provides more protection than nothing at all they knew my friend..they use them in china  for anybody to see...but the autorities didnt have them in stock..could make them available...so what they said to avoid loose face?...noo mask are not useful just wash your hands and this airborne desease will be gone...and minorities having jobs with contact to the people contracted it more..because nobody help them to isolate with a living aid. @Crypto Man the people can\\'t find them, because the government has cut off the supply to the consumers.  \\n\\nI called several manufacturers and asked them to explain why I can\\'t find their masks in my local stores or online.  They refused to talk to me or return my calls. \\n\\nI asked a store clerk about hand sanitizer and she said, the CDC took control of their distribution of that product,  making it impossible for the stores to get it. R R I don’t know why so hard to buy masks? They have tons and tons in China why don’t just Import them and saving people lives. Well stated facts and reasons for discrepancies in the impact of the virus on different communities. The virus is doing them a favor, if they are inside then they aren\\'t butchering each other in the streets hah. Fake news worked on you. Pathetic sheep. Employment, education, economic, health care access opportunity, ect... Having heard these topics have been discussed and applied for the last 30 plus years. You can pull a horse to the water, but you can\\'t make the horse to drink it. I have two degrees and I serve in the military. So tell me, what horse are you talking about? Chanpho Ieng 400 years. Applied? Where? In white suburban areas. Typical rubbish! He should tell his \"big mama\" wife that her  preexisting condition puts her risk. maybe the deathsthat are really not from covid??? Anyone else think the Surgeon General sounds like Mike Tyson? Kamu Ela and so does tyson Dismal yes, he has a lisp. Sounds like a clown and no Tyson does not sound like a clown Mike Tyson with a Doctrine lol Nope ... You\\'ve GOT to be kidding. Tell me why dude looks like a Wayne’s brother Political Correctness is DEADLY!\\nOn Jan. 27 Trump requested China allow a US research team, into Wuhan. The request was rejected, as racist. Iron Mike in Washington, giving a speech, wow!  Mike Tyson has really went on straight and narrow. What an inspiration. Just look at Mike now! Respect, my man! Dude\\'s deep in the sunken place. Review Sam How does he know what, exactly? @Army Vet How does he know that??? He drowned @Chayah Mullins They speak in code. Look up the definition of black. I knew when this CV started they were going to try to make Black people the Poster face of CV. All of a sudden Black people are dying at an alarming rates in the US. In other countries Carribean Uk Africa Italy Spain etc this isn’t true and I don’t believe it’s happening here. They’re promoting fear TMH didn’t give you a spirit of fear but of power and oflove and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1.7 and we are protected Psalm 91 Well, most of the blacks here in Montgomery, Alabama think it\\'s a time to party and have bbqs and don\\'t wear any ppe or observe any of the safety guidelines (social distancing 6\\' rule). They even think it\\'s funny to intentionally crowd others who are following the guidelines just to see what kind of reaction they will get. @jason rosa most people dont even know they have it even if they practice self quarantine. Showing little to no symptoms unless they get tested and even then not all states have the quick test. The hospital in my area is saying 72 hrs for test results. Alot of damage can happen in 72 hrs. Also with allergy season a dry cough can be extremely elusive but it seems to be a key symptom of covid-19. PRAY FOR THEM...GOD LOVES US ALL...BLACK, WHITE, YELLOW, BROWN. WE ALL BLEED RED....FACT @Dark sky\\'s \\nThat not even remotely the reason why you idiot. Same thing, but the strong demographic here is hispanic. Bbqs and parties especially if the weather\\'s nice and they are on a temp layoff. @Dark sky\\'s She isn\\'t in  New Orleans nor Chicago. There they go!! We talking about the oldest humans on the planet yet somehow Black ALWAYS \"disproportionately\" the face of everything. Do they not realize Africa has the youngest population Earth and even if you add the European admixture somehow Black always the _Poster Child_ , never healthy? @Review Sam You miss my point, that is my point. If African-Americans are Africans with some European mixture, then how are we always at risk when neither of those two are. Judah- dang. The native Black Africans are not getting the virus-like that only the African-Americans( with European admixture because of slavery) are getting it. Yes please tell me how I’m more at risk to this virus compared to the white people that live next door to me At 1:20 I really 😭😭😭 how proud he is God protect us all, may all our ancestors guide our paths, and keep us healthy, may they heal those who are hurting, and let us thank all the people who are essential workers from sanitation to stockers at your grocery stores, and bless the hands risking their lives to save ours. 🙏 @Crackersoids have a Low birthrate LOL actually I\\'m native American/ African and proud of my heritage You must not be black They are collecting LOSTED SOULS. #RepentNow!!! Here we go again 🤦 And covid19 stops late April early May.... wait I thought it stayed alive in almost all types of surfaces etc...I guess it only got a 2 month visa The nature of a virus:  (reproduce or die).  If it is not inside a cell, reproducing, it will die (sooner or later)    NOT like a spore. Spores can live for decades (centuries). Lol good  one Their time line isn\\'t correct they\\'re gonna keep changing that It does on all surfaces but diff amounts of time though I\\'m curious to know... Who would the White and Asian community \"leaders\" be? @Dora Perkins I know, I was being sarcastic lol... I can\\'t stand when they say that dumb sh!t Quill B there are none. Because they appoint black leaders to Black people. We don’t even know these people they come out of nowhere because they’ve been trained to say what needs to be said via white supremacy You\\'re telling me this now after I walked around the park with no mask Where have you been for the past month and a half? be responsible for your own life homie Jesse Jackson a black leader ...lmao okay sis no. Jesse Jackson is a puppet @Solo Traveler - Off The Beaten Path You must remember your own white historian grandfather named HERODOTUS went into Egypt in 450BC on an exploratory fact finding mission. He clearly said \"THE EGYPTIAN NATIVES ARE BLACKENED WITH THE HEAT\" You can\\'t call your granddaddie a liar in 2020. Let me know what you\\'re have this is the too easy archaeologist at Michigan State. @Solo Traveler - Off The Beaten Path King Tuts dna came back E1B1A..... that\\'s ethiopian. You forgot ETHIOPIAN is older than a sub Saharan by so many people thousands of years. You\\'re talking AD times with sub saharan rhetoric. Just see my profile pic of the wooden bust King Tuts grandmother named QUEEN TIYE..... You see the afro?? @Josef Daniel Egypt is in North Africa, not Subsaharan Africa. It is not a historically black country. The mummies have been DNA tested and they are closest related to modern day Arabs and even Greeks. Cleopatra was actually white. You have to go hundreds of miles further south into Sudan to find the ancient Nubian Kingdoms and black lands. He\\'s a JESUS FREAK just like you both. Knows no history of the black woman in Egypt,Africa. There trying to block my comments i must be right Is it just me or do he sound like a educated mike Tyson? Chris Carr 🤣 bruh Good information.\\nHand washing.\\nSocial distancing\\n24/7 shelter in place \\nMask\\nGloves\\nCleaning.\\nHelp flatten this curve. Hopefully everyone who wants or needs a mask can get one soon. Tell employees working in stores... They\\'re disgusting and holier then thou with no masks..I want to COUGH on them 100 million government funded 15 minute coronavirus tests per week would allow us to knock this thing out, and get everybody back to work. My Q: What does drinking alcohol have to do with the Coronavirus? If there was ever a time the American people needed class consciousness... Aside from y\\'know, all the time Damn Tyson lost a lot of weight and a face tat... 369 Is this guy Trump\\'s answer to Dr. Fauci? @No Seas Pinche Chairo 😅🙏 @madeleine romulus it was the tricounty memorial hospital in kek county. Small town called gullible @No Seas Pinche Chairo in what stata ? @No Seas Pinche Chairo 😂😂 @MsJgreen77 for sure. I\\'m Hispanic and took my brother to get tested for covid 19. There was a whites only sign and we got kicked out of the hospital. On our way to our car a klans-member yelled obscenities at us. \\nTrump\\'s America is so dangerous for us brown folk. He just coughed.. GG bro Not everything is corona Good game? Hahaha That cough 00:52 Rona corominate confirmed. https://youtu.be/h0lE556h8Kk https://youtu.be/h0lE556h8Kk Who the hell brought up race? Ever heard of Lakewood, NJ? @Angel Johnson None of these Black people were tested. If a doctor \"thinks\" a person had the virus then its listed as COVID when it could have been a pre-existing condition. @Meyaka Brown It is not but they use race to scapegoat Black people. The Surgeon General brought up race. The juden in Lakewood and in Brooklyn are having crowds of thousands of people for rabbi’s funerals and are spreading it the worst by far Do people in Lakewood have to drive over a 1or 2 just to get medical attention? \\nA lot of places in the Southern states they do. \\nYour comparing one place(Lake wood) to what is happening all over the United States. \\nThe Surgeon General, doctors and others mentioned race because they are tested positive more. \\nAlso people where saying that Blacks and other people of color could not get it, which is a lie. People are now seeing how people of color are more at risk, for different reasons. \\n70% of people who have covid-19 are Black who live in Chicago and New Orleans.  Chicago, New York & Michigan   The Southern states like Georgia, Louisiana are starting to been at risk\\nWhen H1N1 happen people of color, who where Hispanic and Native American where at a higher risk\\nIn the South, in poor areas, \\nsome people have to drive over an hour or 2, just to go to the hospital or a doctor. \\nTrump lied and said everyone will be tested, when people have been turned down and been told they where not a priority because they where poor, had no health insurance and a person of color\\nOne reason Blacks are at higher risk, because some people, said that Blacks and other minorities could not get the virus and people listen to them. \\n So they didn\\'t take it seriously and didn\\'t take precautions, social distance themselves, they spread it to others.\\n Young adults still had parties, went on trips for spring break and just didn\\'t care \\nIntimates who have committed non violent crimes, where told they would be released so they would not spread or get the virus\\nPrisons in the South like Florida and Alabama have people of color still in prison, who are already living in nasty, filthy prison cells. Who where told they will not get out and just get ready to die\\nIn Michigan, churches had  funerals \\nA COGIC church exposed 300 people to the virus.  \\nPoverty, no health insurance, underline health problems, like diabetes, asthma, autoimmune disease\\nNot social distancing, being turned down for help because of their race, where they live\\nBlacks and Hispanics work more service jobs, and they are more vulnerable to get the virus 🦝 🦝 🦝 Look once the line came out last week its attacking minority’s that’s code for we going to open back up next month this isn’t a American issue it’s a minority issue jasmine masters made a video about this I looked it up just for the heck of it and dear god was it disgusting Saying the “M” word is going to piss off somebody Too may ignorant comments on here. Sad. @LOUIS XVII yo Louis u my intellectual hero. Because ur so correct I\\'m going to start following u.& yes I was a bit just a bit ignorant 🤭🤭👍👍👍👍👍👍 Get Down Gaming \\n\\nWhat I’m saying is who the hell are you to call anyone “uneducated?” \\n\\nWe have all received educations as it is against the law to deny a child, in America, an education. \\n\\nMaybe you meant ignorant rather than uneducated. But we will never know, you’ve already embarrassed yourself. @norman gates Your 13 years of education was a waste to tax dollars apparently. @LOUIS XVII So you\\'re saying it\\'s not smart to go to college? Instead of accelerating your quality of life as well as well as knowledge, you\\'d rather not? Have you heard of grants and scholarships? Kindergarten is optional, so 12 years of schooling? Never own a home with a college degree? Same education regardless of economic background? Are you just speaking your opinion, because that\\'s what it sounds like. @Get Down Gaming 13 yrs of education  & u still know nothing John snow 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭👅👅👅 Just say what it is ..\\n\\nMost essential workers are minorities and they get expose the most working to provide goods services and supplies for the non essential workers Because that\\'s not what it is, that has a shred of truth buried in a stereotype @darknite 123222 pretty much I\\'d bet the vast majority are white people. koreatopnews.buzz/Ag5iitA28aV WOW i\\'ve got a question what about mixed races are they affected too? At will of representation. If your Canadian do you die white or Hispanic? If you claim white and their investigation say you\\'re white when you are hispanic, would increase the potential distrust of reports.  Call your physician, to determine the trend. yes. this answer was seriously considered on yt. Remember the one drop rule, 1% black = 100% black Lol Mike Tyson looks different these days. I could have sworn he had a tattoo on his face. @greg j your comment reminded me of the key and peele skit https://youtu.be/cBQiLh9N6kg. It was basically from the Mike Tyson press conference 🤣🤣🤣 @Random Guy I burst out laughing when I saw your original comment.  Too funny. @leicanoct he was too busy kicking ass Random Guy Mike could of been Surgeon General if he only stayed in school. 😭😂😂😂 Tyrone Adam’s is right 👌🏻 So there is no genetic reason for most any person coming down with anything. Its mostly due to social difference as well as cultural norms. @Review Sam my thoughts exactly. If it hit parts of Africa hard it would be devastating. No @Imperious Rex Heat yes @Review Sam Is it possible that the heat is slowing the spread and possibly the isolation due to non travel to the region Imperious- Africans are not getting it. And you can get it more if you have a pre-existing conditions. Agreed woman aren\\'t fat anymore they\\'re curvy or bbw S/o to the white media! We see you\\'re running outta tricks and are desperate in this hour lol. It makes our job so much easier! #HighIQ 😎 is he the new Mike Tyson? Hey can they break it down by ethnicity please ? I need it to be very specific please and thank you . 🤨 Oh Marone \\n\\nGod Bless America and Our President 🇺🇸🦅 @Max Hardcore okay bye @Adan Sanchez How am I supposed to tell if your kidding or being serious. I\\'m reading a comment on YouTube. It\\'s not like I see you making a funny face or gesture. Ditch the sarcasm, its not for you @Max Hardcore ohmygosh , so in your opinion you that I was being serious when I wasn\\'t .\\nThat\\'s it that all Maximilian 💪🏼🇺🇸 @Adan Sanchez True sarcasm is easily identifiable. Don\\'t get mad at me cuz you suck at it. \\n\\nAnd for some reason your \"assuming\" im Italian. If your not on the far left yet, they are waiting for ya @Max Hardcore don\\'t assume next time stunod the part with the inhaler for kids and dreams <<<3333 Dude has the world strongest lithsp 😂 On March 8th, a maskless Adams told Brennan “masks do not work for the general public. On Twitter a week earlier, he said “Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS.” Is this the 5th video in the past few days on The ABC News channel regarding the same subject matter?   How about just one video on how men are more likely to die from the virus and why? at mail Race, gender, economics, etc all go into the multi-variable analysis. It is all about cramming the narrative. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 I really like this guy. Why? in other news:  George Snuffalufgas needs to go away. i look up to this man as a young black male. I too hope to go to med school and become a surgeon. Wanna make my dad proud of me wheelzz wheelzz he’s a surgeon. That’s a sad statement. I’m sorry u see him as a role model. The internet is absolutely a mostly negative space. I found his words inspirational and honest.  I truly wish you the best of luck in your dreams and I truly believe you will make a difference in life someday.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t give up. Push and fight against all odds for your goals.\\n\\n\\nsincerely,\\nsomeone who didn\\'t fight and gave up on all of his goals. @Harold Henderson thanks, so much for the advice Don\\'t let ANYONE stop you!  It may take a long time, you must be determined.  It might be worthwhile to start in nursing and become a Physician Assistant (PA).

It\\'s a co-opting term to infiltrate anything that may be beneficial to black society.  Sort of like The term minority.  So, if a program or funds need to go specifically to black people in America, they pull the old \"people of color\" term out, cripple the program and leave black people at square one with all the resources going to other groups @Zac I already have a nice tan!!! @Painkiller Jones no,     ok,    will you make an honorary person of color He is wrong for doing this!!!!! So wrong!     I am so dissappointed! Maybe this was done as a negotiation tactic. Either way it\\'s horrible! Why\\'s that?       There was an autopsy report from the victims of covid in China.

It\\'s pretty clear that this is an excuse. You wanted to take a jab at \"the media\" being biased or unfair in some way, but you were wrong. And now you\\'re using the excuse that you were just joking to backpedal your inaccurate statements. @Dante Alighieri xd @Lyxtra they dont need to report this at all but they do like it said its a joke @Matthew Lollino All of the current information suggests that minorities are being disproportionately affected by the virus. I don\\'t think simply mentioning this fact should be equated to fear mongering. WELL O MY ...

Keep Hope Alive 🙏4🇺🇸🤠 Hypertension Everyone that don\\'t have a strong body aint going to survive but will go to heaven amd the one that do still in armagenton https://youtu.be/HJIqWneyt9E 🤔 This is why we should all strike for healthcare when this ends. We don\\'t have to protest in the streets, just not go back to work until we get what we deserve. While the unemployment expansion lasts, this is our chance! \\nIf we don\\'t use our leverage now to help ALL social classes, races, sexes, etc we might not get a chance to fix this problem! They just spent $6 Trillion in a month without asking who is paying for it?! They could\\'ve given us 2 yrs of universal healthcare for that. They could\\'ve transferred to a system that runs to save lives and money by solving problems better. Instead of a for profit system that exploits peoples health. Instead they use the crisis to give corp money out. \\n\\nIf THEY don\\'t ever let a crisis go to waste, neither should WE! There are so many of us, we can force their hands if we take away the cogs in their money machines.\\n\\n#GENERALSTRIKE @C 546799 I\\'m actually Canadian lol so the comment about me paying taxes ... etc is irrelevant actually. As we have universal healthcare here I still feel like health care starts at home and in our practices and ways of life. Now more than ever we must realize that we cannot rely on a system that keeps failing us! We have it good here in Canada but the real woke people know that we still are subject to the system here. We still have a lot of overweight black people with diabetes and high blood pressure. Universal healthcare won\\'t solve all your problems. Y\\'all been fighting for it for years. They. Dont. Fucking. Care. Build your immune system up and stop relying on hospitals it\\'s just another system for them to abuse you. Real wealth is health. Indeed to each their own. You have the right to slowly die in a system that wasn\\'t designed to help you. What the hell has all the protesting and marching done for y\\'all latley.. you could just fast once a month for 3 days minimum and get off meds and exercise more and eat less processed foods and more fruits and vegetables or you could organize a protest. ✌🏾🙋🏿\\u200d♂️☠⚰ @Yawköw Ashong 😂😂😂 ok! Wtf?! What a ridiculous point to make that has ZERO to do with my comment. Health care starts at home. Fast for 3 days to reset the immune system... dont eat junk! Iron Mike?????? It Was Dropped  In The Air, TYSONS BROTHER. I think the issues are more income related than race related.  It would be interesting to see a breakdown by income or class as well.  I would bet that\\'s why more AfAm are affected because they are generally under-employed. Good on the surgeon general for showing that he too, depends on an inhaler and is mindful  of disease and the virus. We must protect our  fellow neighbors and stay on lockdown .. Mike Tysons lisp talking where is Dr. Fauci? Dems be sayin, \"Dats de Trump virus since it\\'s racist!\" @Chief Tahchawwickah WTF??? I\\'m fluent in slap-a-hoe, and you still don\\'t make any sense.

First of all, and most importantly, GEM has shown prove that he purchased the $99 unlimited license, which according to the terms on beatstar allows him to use the beat for profit in performances and online. He has all the subtracks of this beat and chose to leave the watermark in because he likes it. He legally purchased the right to use this beat and has always acknowledged the beat-maker. After the song became viral he tried to contact Ihsaki to purchase the exclusive right to the beat but Ihsaki declined his request the first few times. After a while Ihsaki told him that he has since then sold the exclusive license to some one else. The some one else, who is later known as Mr. Chen from Taiwan, approach GEM and his manager saying that he has gained the exclusive right to the beat, requesting GEM to make a version of the song with Minnan Accent (Taiwan Accent) and to share a large amount of profit with Mr. Chen.

Is that right? We need the truth, hope you can tell us. Thank you. @Mr. anderson Could you please go to learn the contract? Where did you found that only for public live performance? Mr. anderson According to Mr.Ihaksi’s statement under this beat, the 99$ version is the commercial version, anyone could use this beat for commercial if he paid for it. Exclusive version means the buyer buy out the copyright and no one else could use this beat unless he paid to the buyer. Hope you can understand Mr.Ihaksi’s statement. Mr. anderson You can see Mr. Ihaksi’ s name when the Chinese singer sing the song on the commercial performance or at music apps . And the agreement also shows that the Chinese singer can use this beat for profit commercial performance if he bought unlimited vision. not the commercial version,the Chinese only paid 99$  to buy the unlimited version but not the exclusive version,and claims the he was the writer    of the rhythm and published the song publicly, Gross 真不知道，为啥那么多人什么都知道就用就在那说「偷」？偷你家大米了？太逗了 Man, that\\'s a masterpiece! 老舅董宝石晒出了合同和购买记录 购买了无限制使用权 董宝石确实花了99美金购买了这只曲子的unlimited release，所以不能算侵权。不过人之常情，什么东西一旦赚钱了，人就眼红得像狼了。不过董宝石确实没侵权。没有他的作词，演绎，推广。谁又会知道作曲者是谁呢。因为宝石，作曲者也成名。不是应该感恩吗。 @Samuel Sze 您是有父母养没父母教呢？还是今天吃了屎口这么臭啊？请问您我哪个字污蔑了自己人呢？ @jianjiang Shi 素质真高，上来就跪舔洋人，污蔑同胞。 @Samuel Sze 你素质真底下。开口就骂人。 但不是exclusive 123Lunatic Talent job.

There were repeated contacts with this Ihaksi to purchase exclusive rights. The exchange of emails starts at 5:17 in the first link. Andrea Jiang \\nThere’s a big difference between composers and music arrangers. Composer is the one who created the melody of the song, but music arrangers change the style, tempo, rhythm or instruments of the song. The job of music arrangers usually base on the work of composers, like a derivative work. But the problem of this Chinese musician is that he literally copy the whole song of lhaksi without any his own creations. He also claimed that he is the composer of this song. Lhaksi is not the music arrangers of this“song”, lhaksi is the original composer of this song. Well, in my opinion this Chinese musician is nothing but a mean thief. He thought no one would know about his crime but he forgot the existence of internet. you are the best！！！I love this melody but i hate that guy . the gay u hated had pay for the beat a few months ago，but \\rIhaksi don\\'t tell you but that guy paid 99$ for this beat, so what are you going to say now? Ihaksi At least you deserve to mentioned as a composer! The instrumental was composed by you. This is undeniable. All kinds of musicians deserve respect. Like Clean Bandit, Marshmallow, Alan Walker. The song does not only belong to the singer. A hip hop instrumental is colloquially referred to as a beat or musical composition and its composer is referred to as a programmer, songwriter or beat maker. \\r\\n\\r\\nA hip hop producer often functions as a both the composer that composes the musical track and traditional record producer, as the orchestrator like P. Diddy being the person who is ultimately responsible for the final sound of a recording. What is a rap producer?\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically the Producer, in Rap music, is the term to refer to beatmakers, those who make the beat, the music base or instrumental track that rappers use to rap on. So if you see. Song - Artist (Prod. by Random guy) Random guy made the beat used by Artist.\\r\\n\\n\\nhttps://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.4011/title.underground-report-7-new-indie-hip-hop-songs-you-need-to-hear They do not use terms like the arranger or composer in hip hop, just songwriters and producer. The role of a beatmaker is paramount in hip hop production. The work they do is usually framed as producing so the term beatmaker has become synonymous as that of a producer. Beatmaker like the people who do lyrics is considered as a songwriter.\\n\\n\\nhttps://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2e9257567c716a493cf9b78957779cfc Cecelia Dela Can’t agree with you. If a instrumental is just “accompany”, why not everyone just enjoys acapella? @Koko Nina I went back to the guy\\'s song, you are right, he mentioned arranger. However, in the music released by the Chinese guy, he composed the vocal melody and flow,  the rest was from Ihaksi. In pop music, the accompanying music serves the main vocal melody, so normally the person who writes the main vocal melody is composer and the one who made accompany music is arranger. You are right that Ihaksi is the composer of More sun, no doubt. But the Chinese man also has done nothing wrong in putting Ihaksi as \"arranger\" in the music he released ( \"XX disco\") in China ( it is no longer More Sun anymore, it\\'s a new song with the accompanying music of More Sun) great beat! I swear I\\'ve heard a similar beat somewhere before. Tyke baker yes，you’re right support you!!  -From HKer Brooooo best song ever keep some songs like this plz I needed for my background songs keep it up I subscribe to y & good songs 😃😃😃👍 Niiiiice !!!🔥🔥🔥 I got some anime vibes from this beat Waiting for the good news!

Since it mostly wouldn’t matter anymore, or at least I think it won’t. @Uh Huh My understanding comes from the Extra History YouTube series on the pandemic. They said it was probably from Kansas or China (IIRC). I would definitely want to do my own research before making precise claims, but you should check it out if you want a concise intro to the various hypotheses. Jeff Benton \\nOk, I’m confused. I thought it originated in the US and that the one which appeared in those Chinese coal miners (and, I think, they were called ‘coolies’) was just a pneumonia plague. I am no expert though. Just collected some pieces that doesn’t match up with the things in my memories. @Owen Plourde My understanding of the China hypothesis is that it wasn\\'t trade, but support personnel for the Allied armies that spread the contagion. (The Chinese gov\\'t supplied huge numbers of much needed workers to the Entante powers late WWI, then received nothing for it at the Treaty of Versailles) @Eugene Balfour not confirmed. it is believed to have originated in the US and spread during WW1 with American troops. China is also on the list of possible starting points with trade. but that one is weak bc trade was extremely limited in Europe due to the mass war, china feared that their ships, products and people would be attacked Sasanian empire: *coughs * ;(\\nByzantine empire: *coughs * ;c \\n*ISLAM: hey guys what I’d miss ?* Why are you guys fighting,tell me huh,if you are fighting for the best religion then dont king nuggets commented his opionion,and i thought its funny,you guys fight for nothing,you get anger,with anger you cause other people to be mad why can we just be friends VIRGINIA MY HOME SWEET HOME I WANNA GIVE YOU A KISS just some several orthodox revolutions who will kick your ass out of Europe @Franz Lütold no @Franz Lütold >>  Ja, ja .... naturlish !!!!   :o)) *I really wish I wasn\\'t living thought a major historical event right now* @CrabEdits its only a major event well at least because not many major things have happened ever since ussr fall, also the communist party of china are responsible for making it global Space_LemonZ How is a global pandemic a minor event? @Clapped_cookie ur knowledge really do be clapped. Every single pandemic in the last century for strict quarantine @Adam Hope besides there was much much more deadly pandemics in the last 50 years @Adam Hope ye m8 i wonder why  a billion people were infected I have always wanted a parody of Yakko\\'s \\'Nations of the World\\', but it\\'s a parody with the name \\'Plagues of the World\\'. @Patrick Langlois the first one was a epidemic not a pandemic Patrick Langlois Panic is never a good reaction but given this outbreak is far more widespread and contagious than the other ones, it’s naturally going to warrant some. The first 2 Coronavirus outbreaks weren’t pandemics and died out rather quickly. Say no more https://youtu.be/eXchwxivCME 1tems, the SARS is also a Coronavirus disease. Humanity lived with three pandemic of Coronavirus.\\n\\n1. The 2003 SARS pandemic caused by the SARS Cov 1 virus also called the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\\n2. The 2010-2020 MERS cov \\n3. The ungoing 2020 SARS Cov 2.\\n\\nThe two first pandemics of that virus doesn’t provoque panic to people. Then, we are in a third pandemic and people panic. Imagine having to learn the lyrics... Europe: *silence*\\nAll other continents: u want virus? Europe: GIMME THAT COFFEE, GIMME-Ugh GIM ME T H A T C O F F E E!! more like european lifestyle back then, and American lifestyle know. @M.Ibtasam Javed  kinda of @anthony Jones u mean europe in response (Especially Britain) start colonizing countries especially african countries other cotinents give viruses to europe\\neurope in response gives viruses to the world COVID-19 kind of a joke compared to these outbreaks!! You are so right. There are diseases way more deadly than Covid. After all, diseases such as the Spanish Flu and Ebola (I suppose?) are still in the game :D @Stephen Courton they are exaggerated numbers. Don\\'t get the phoney vaccine if one comes available buster hyman The death and case reports come from county health depts, many totally under republican control. They report names of people who died, in local papers. Don’t believe then go to a hospital or trace down families of victims. Also CDC reports 2020 deaths year to date over 200k more than 2019 same date. They dying of something? @Stephen Courton don\\'t believe what MSM is telling you buster hyman Like 800-1000 people die per day in summer from flu? Besides not being pandemic, I would like to learn more for recent diseases: SARS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, Ebola, Zika. Ulises Silva \\nthat’s a pandemic And Coronavirus. Don\\'t forget the star of the show _mad cow disease_ originally projected to kill 200 million, killed 200 in a decade, computer modeling off by just a little bit or byte. Sars is a epidemic, china was lucky the first time they\\'ve covered it up as the virus was not super infectious, this time, china was like AHHHAh ill use the same tactic to cover things up and hope for the best but got slapped in the face by the cooler sars @Synthetic Band 101 yea it was\\nThey have only mentioned the major ones Imagine Europe\\'s population now if none of these happened... It would be about 2B people I think @NewBenCity European colonization obviously brought many resources to Europe, but I\\'m not sure if that is true.  Wealth was distributed to peasants when their labor became valuable (the black death killed 2/3 of Europe).  If Europe did not have a wealth advantage over Africa and Asia, then they wouldn\\'t have been able to colonize.  That is why countries like China were not colonized as they were very wealthy due to their geography (exuding Hong Kong and the other one i forgot)  Geography is what determines the fate of nations, The US became an economic and world power due to the good Industrial land ans its isolation form world powers.  Countries like Britain dominated Europe because it was an Island and was less likely to be invaded.  A country like China is very wealthy today and also has great agricultural land.  But you have Africa which was never able to prosper in the same way due to the Geography of the African Continent.  Africa is obviously known for being mostly a desert, most desert nations (except oil rich ones) are poor today.  You have some exceptions like the USA west coast, but that is because it was built by a wealthy nation.  ///////////////////////Don\\'t want this to be massive essay but basically due to Europe geography the first world would still exist as the geography of Europe is ideal for agriculture and industry. @Jimmeazee There\\'s no basis for saying that lol, and besides if Europe didn\\'t colonise the world as a result there would be no \\'first world\\' as we see one in the modern day. Europe would be poor and would be a third world continent, one of the reasons the peasants broke free from feudalism was that the peasants work was valuable as there were few of them, if it weren\\'t for those diseases Europe would be poor and ruled by nobles. @Justin H?? The doctor who invent the vaccine called Edward Jenner. Not John Fuster. John Fewster was a friend of Edward Jenner and played an important role to find the smallpox vaccine He was talking about John Fewster discovering the phenomenon with cowpox in 1768. It\\'s weird how the majority of the diseases mentioned start from East Asia... @Samuel Hall can I ask what country you came from? Go to Hanoi, Shanghai etc and you will see why... absolutely filthy! That\\'s not racist, just reality. H M M . . . Because asia was more advanced with agriculture back then. Besides there\\'s higher biodiversity and population indeed. H1N1, SARS, MERS: is this a literal joke good video. interesting fact about where the word Quarantine came from :) you guys really want to know about a word that means forty days @Blocky3253 Not the concept of quarantine, just the origin of the English word for it. It comes from the word Quarant meaning forty Quarantine originated in Iran, they introduced it to Europeans. The black plage also attacked, North Africa, North Ethiopia, Eritrean port and Sudan port including to some account. He only mentioned europe because it was the most affected. @Cyrus Malaria, Measles, Dengue Fever, Ebola, and COVID-19: *laughs in virus* Jeff Benton is’nt the Black death part of the bubonic Plague? You stupid? No one cares about africa, pirate man You have taught me so much more than my school has. Thank you so much for these videos man, keep up the great work you deserve so many more subscribers :) i\\'m pretty sure every single video like this teaches you faster than school lmao Yeah Hey guys okay we all heard of some disease like Spanish flu Black Death: exists\\nMongols: YEET Three cheers for those who have learnt  the History we should know through this amazing channel \"Catapulted their dead to make the city sick\"\\nBRUH WAT 😳 Modern problems require modern solutions So what? throw the bodies with virus, ppl touch bodies, they get sick, city get sick, country surrender. the first case of biological warfare Surprised? ^^ Most of the pandemics start in asia hmmmmmm\\n\\nWelcome to the rice fields Roman Empire : I\\'m covering almost all europe\\'s map aha \\n\\nBlack death : Hold my beer I find it interesting that most of these pandemics originated from non-European nations. Although, there mostly responsible for global colonization. The Greek historian mentioned at 1:03 is Thucydides, and if you really like history, you\\'ll probably like his book \"The Peloponnesian War\" (although it\\'s really long). Africa and italy are always victims to these pandemics. My heart goes for them brentonz Italy is a shithole for a first world country, but my heart goes out to them (and spain) as well. Priyanshi Gupta yeah my heart goes to Italy they have always had an incredible civilization This is another reason I\\'m glad I wasn\\'t born back then. I\\'m tested positive for Cholera AND Leprosy, so I would have died if I was alive in Europe when the Mongol empire was a thing, or had to see my neighbors and family die, if in Asia. I\\'m actually of Bengali ethnicity, where he said Cholera began, so I have a severe disadvantage, but my family also have both Cholera and Leprosy. Medicine is bad in Bangladesh, and my family WAS actually poor, so there was no way for me to avoid this. I\\'ve had both Cholera and Leprosy for years. I\\'ve had them ever since my young childhood at 4, as long as my memory goes\\n\\nYes, it obviously feels like a living hell to have both Cholera and Leprosy ever sin e I was a baby, and to still have it in my adulthood. I don\\'t mean to ramble too much, I don\\'t want you to think that I\\'m faking having these diseases just for attention, this is a serious situation for me. just wish me luck on this recovery @beri sorry about that glad that you corrected me @Qlaxander Luck Leprosy is not a genetic disease. It\\'s a bacteria and is treatable by antibiotics. I don\\'t understand how anyone in the 21st century can have leprosy. @beri genetics How the fuck did you get leprosy Diamond_GalaxyCat What the fuck this guy is fighting off a deadly disease and you’re over here ‘relating’ with your itching I know it\\'s tough right now but I actually wouldn\\'t mind seeing a video about the American Revolutionary War Check out oversimplified Leprosy,, East Africa😂😂 am Kenyan 🇰🇪 wow ❤️ from India Same here, from India/Bangladesh Video about pandemics: *ends*\\nTrap music in the background: 12:15 HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH The sun is shining when you upload!Btw very nice video,glad you are back :) You have taught me more than what I studied about diseases in my schooldays.\\nForever be grateful to you!\\n🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Same here bro Ayush G facts Finally!

It\\'s intirely possible. The people behind the video are French. The main channel is French (Histoire Géo) but they also translate their videos in English, Spanish, Russian and Arabic. I believe they only have an English speaker do the audio. The black death:i will catch all you!\\n\\nPoland bohemia and hungary:\\nI guess no :) Wow nice one But if you look at it with modern borders hungary was hit. Slovakia was not. And since at the time the places of ethnicities and regions was kinda the same hugnary or atleast hungarians were hit Humans: we are fighting a world war how can things get any worst?\\n\\n1900s flu: *_allow me to introduce myself_*\\n\\nWorld: *ight imma head out* Bajan Games you can’t breath you must caught the flu 🤒 🤧 😷 from that joke Ian Marti bro I’m gonna die of laughing so much I can’t breathe @Ian Marti ikr thats a very funny joke my dude I didn’t know the Spanish Flu started in the US! Why is it called Spanish then? It was actually Chinese. @micknotfromleitrim Just neutral countries dunking on eachother. 😂 Better than fighting, I suppose. @Ocean Weather and Mapping yes. Also, the King of Spain at that time got infected by the flu. Thats may be another reason the mame stock. @Tony Fontaine in the US, in the military camp. micknotfromleitrim That’s a pretty interesting fact 5:52 Thanks Russell 5:10 - Yersinia Pestis just wanted to recreate the Roman Empire duh Coved: I rule you hoomuns\\nMe, with a vaccine: I have Nukes which can thanos you\\nCoved: nooooooo Geo History, I love your work and I think that your team does an excellent job on each of your videos.

May of been part of an epidemic but not a epidemic @Team YouTube  the time when the Bubonic Plague hit London in 1665 France: Fails to invade Russia\\nGermany: Fails to invade Russia\\nBlack Death and Coronavirus: Invade Russia Am I the only one who notices in plague inc Argentina and turkey are SUPER easy to infect? \\nYes? .....ok then And the least infected are Greenland and Madagascar lol Lol I already had known about it Please make more of these during quarantine, there one of the only things keeping me going Best channel i have ever followed !

Small detail but when Colombus sailed it was after Spain united Castille and Aragon as well as Granada and Seville An interesting fact is that Michel Nostradamus was known as a plague doctor, risking his life many times to go into cities that had the plague and helping the sick.   He was in another city when his family died from a plague outbreak in his home town. And what about the last pandemic of Influenza AH1N1 virus from 2009? He should of just used Plague Inc ',\n",

You okay?\" 6:00 if I were you I would have told her to either get in the car or we leave and you don\\'t eat. if i was in that situation and a grown ass adult was throwing a tantrum over a car seat, i would’ve just driven off and left her there 2:47 Does he have any more videos with this kind of animation, I like the normal, I just want to see more. Watch his video called (dreams) the whole point of this video is: never get angry or do it in a way that freaks out everyone. How I deal with the “Ellen” incident:\\nMe: “we’re leaving in 2 minutes, with or without you.”\\nThen I stay by that. Yep Same If I were Phill: I would write a letter,put it in a random position,and go home Oof @Peter Marsella God dang it I was just about to write that When my friend Daelan gets angry he gives off an aura of rage so thick it summons a jojo stand If I were in your situation with ellen, here’s what would have happened:\\nI would get out of the car\\nSay: I am the only one that have a car so it’s either you get in or you starve \\nThen I would give her my stone cold fake smile.\\nIf she doesn’t, then I will just go back in the house and get all of my stuff and go to a hotel. What everyone takes out of this: “being mad isn’t fun, and it’s mentally taxing.”\\n\\nWhat I take out if it: Do your best to never be mad, so that when you are mad it will be a whole lot scarier. When I was little I destroyed everything in my room when I get angry. \\nAnd now I just go cry in bathroom. can we appreciate this totally awesome fight scene at 2:45-2:55 for a second? holy moly, that\\'s amazing!! Some One RIGHT!!!! That was not a fight scene that was Alex\\'s funeral And totally hilarious. Just for a Takoyaki lol\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCouldn’t Domics just buy two orders of takoyaki XD Ikr \"You know those times when you are angry for so long, you get.. tired?\" Yup, i feel u If i were you with ellen i would have said “if you ever dare make that outburst ever again i wouldn’t hesitate to cut off your hair so you will be bald forever…okay let’s go! :3” Dude idk how you were able to deal with Ellen, I know for a fact I would be screaming. If I was the driver, I’d leave while flipping her off. Everyone\\'s gangsta until Zac changes his shoes\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s see how many people get that xD Ellen : **proceeds to sit on porch**\\n\\n\\nme : **proceeds to drive away** @Bryce Scott if they wanted to be a child treat them like one. Drive off and pretend annie x THATS WHAT I THOUGHT!!! You don’t want to get in the car you’re not coming!😆 heck yeah Genius I would of lol 6:10 wouldn’t that bee like rlly personal to tell 7m *cough fake *caught Who just realized that his intro sounds like the ph intro I\\'ve watched his videos for about 10 minutes and I love it already XD I’m the chillest, happiest, “vibiest” guy in my friend group until we get on \\nwar zone. *Jommus Animus was the greatest philosopher in history*\\n\\n*my school taught me about him once* Hello TJ! NOTICE ME SENPAI Hi utube has been recommending me ur video TJ Toons hey sup man To me Aristotle was the best, but I’ve never learned about Jommus Animus in school so yeah 1:04 I\\'ve heard it somewhere \\nBut a different version 🤔 in kindergarten, my kindergarten teacher read a book during reading aloud, noticed that the name of the main character was similar to the one she heard my mom use, and proceeded to call me that name for the rest of the year. this went on until 2nd grade when she stopped calling me the name and proceeded to point me out in large groups. in 3rd grade, I started hiding from her because of it. during assemblies, when she went on stage, I  would look down in hopes she wouldn\\'t see me. when I was walking in the hallways, I would take the route farthest from her classroom. in 4th grade, as the end of the school year drew closer and closer, I started to hope that she would be replaced next year. turns out I spoke too soon. in 5th grade, on continuation day, as soon as I left the building, I got a cookie with my name on it, left the premises, and was soooooooooooo happy. there is no way I will ever go back to that drive-thru-of-a-school ever again. Some reason I need a explanation for this people mess with me but know how strong I am but when I get mad and chase them really fast because I am the tied 2 fastest runner in my school they get scared and apologise does anyone know why? I love how simple and to the point his titles are Ellen: *sits on stairs acting like a 2 year old*\\n\\nMe: *drives* Drives into a pole* me: *runs her over* I would give them a warning or two, then leave. They can figure it out. Wait... Drive into her or away? What should\\'ve happened I\\'m a super chill dude, like people call me weird sometimes when I\\'m supposed to be mad but I\\'m just like \"Eh\"\\nI got hit by a motorbike moron not following traffic laws once and still have that scar on my feet when I was dragged on the road with the bike, I\\'m still not mad at that guy and just let him go\\n\\nBut a \"friend\" of mine, a known prankster in highschool, would now stop messing with me while I was trying to finish a homework during Study Hall before the next class begin. I snapped, hold his ears with enough force to tear it, and talk in a very stern voice to shut the fuck up and let me work in peace. The class went silent, like dead silent after that\\n\\nDon\\'t mess with the quiet ones, they\\'re usually the scariest when they reach their limit I thought the music in the background of the vid was coming from somewhere else, but when I heard it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nit was the only thing I could think of XD I was the president in my class and I got so angry everyone goes quiet and there jaw dropped 1:45 well getting anger DOES make you hotter so it does dry your pants Why pay for Anger Management courses when you have Domics Because its court mandated. :( Agreed Basant Gaur you right, you right When the sponsor ad is exactly 10 seconds 🥳 \" _Sometimes to win is to walk away_ \" - *Dom* You see I was blessed with a beautiful gift of not holding grudges. I never developed it I just don’t hold grudges. i have a friend like phill we never seen him mad before it kinda scary \"Anger is like taking poison and then expecting someone else to die\"\\n\\n-Unknown @David50X 👀 Or you know... A reaction @Unknown Human Damn mommy @korngotmuted ok good @korngotmuted no \"Being angry does not worth your energy\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost every shonen anime: *say sike right now* Bro, do u know what is the scariest is that when he was drawing The douch bag Alex, the person looked exactly like me and also had the same name as me I just wake up every morning thanking God Iam not a murder yet.. \"We\\'ll call him, Adam.\" \\n\\n\\nMe: *AND EVE* Omg, \"build a raft out of your limbs\"! I\\'ve never heard that one before XD It makes it especially funny because of his face when he said it Soranaru Soranaru Soranaru so smart 800th like I never know dom could go that hard 🤣 Soranaru me too ',\n",

His first song that i listened was Hey Brother and when i knew that he suicided i felt really bad for his fans. At least he will still composing great music with God and the rest of artists so today my dog died and he\\'s my bestfriend, he always listen to my problem. “without you, i feel broke, like i’m half of a whole.” \\n\\n\\n\\ni recently lost my bestfriend. while i don’t like how she abruptly left me, i don’t hate or dislike her. she’s taught me so much, about myself, about friendship, and has just made me a better person. this song really brings back memories from when we stood out in the rain dancing like idiots with this song playing. my heart hurts so badly at the realization that nothing lasts forever. i remember us doing our handshake while listening to this song in the car. i truly loved her with everything i had. \\n“without you, i’m just a sad song.” @Kion Indonesia its fine sorry I didn\\'t text my phone died @hayleys custer No, I\\'m Not Mad At All. BTW, Sorry For Late Reply I Was Sleeping @Kion Indonesia u mad or something????? @Kion Indonesia bro what you doing @Kion Indonesia i dont know. What you wanna talk about ive liked this girl for 3 years and confessed and she liked me too but a month later she told me that she used to liked me and i was too late ive been crying in bed ever since then i got nobody to talk to pls help Awee :( “Alright bro goodnight let’s play tomorrow”\\n\\n“Okay”\\n\\n*last online 6 years ago* My god you alright bro I had this friend she\\'s still not on its been I think 4 yrs hopefully she just made different account *i feel you bro* I don\\'t get what happened.what happened to him? I feel it😢😢 I feel bad for my mom she cry\\'s 5 times a year over her friends and family\\'s deaths: Her mom died and her sister Lacy. 2 of her friends died 1 from cancer the other i think from drugs i just know that she lost a lot of people she loves and when we get the news about there deaths she starts crying and stays in her room all day i don\\'t mind helping at all i only feel bad for her since she been through so much i can\\'t even imagine if i died or one of my siblings i just really hate seeing her so sad and broken this song pulls those feeling from my heart and that\\'s why i am writing this cause i feel helpless when she gets like this and now that Covid19 is around it must be even harder. She told me once that she posted something about how life was hard and like a lot of her friends were trying to tell her its ok that\\'s why it must be so hard for her to lose them. I have not really lost anyone so i can only imagine the pain she suffers.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the support! 😢 wow i feel bad too now @Chloe Edmonston alright @Jesse Murillo Alright will do! @Chloe Edmonston yelwelcome just comment in the chat if u need help @Jesse Murillo Thank you.

That\\'s so sad and dangerous because you can\\'t help them I like to hide in myself as if I\\'m a cheerful and positive girl... Make the world around me notice me as a positive person... And depression helps me a lot... Even if it hurts... I\\'ve been hurt so many times, I don\\'t even know how I feel. But it\\'s okay... Because I don\\'t have to fight anymore... I only know how to give up... But I\\'m trying to fight... Even if it\\'s horribly hard... At least I have someone who supports me...

Her and I were together for almost 7 years. She never once talked to me without telling me that she loved me more than anything. Every time we had an argument, she would hug me until I calmed down. We would go on drives most weekends out to empty spaces, we would park the car and lay on the hood and stare at the stars. Often times we would have long deep conversations for hours until we fell asleep holding each others hands tightly. We both always knew, we would never cheat, never leave. It would never be worth it, and we always saw the amazing person standing in front of us. When I couldn\\'t stand to look at my own reflection, she complimented me on how many people would rather be me, than their own selves. She told me her deepest, darkest secrets, and was never scared to tell the truth, no matter how painful it might\\'ve been. We dated from middle school and high school, and even college. We spent years, on the bus, listening to music, looking in each others\\' eyes. Most days we took the bus home to my house, and spent the whole day playing card games. board games, and watching movies. We were more than lovers, we were best friends, we were family. I met her in a mental hospital after we both had attempted suicide. She has taught me so much. And even though she is not here today, I know that she wants me to stay alive, to keep pushing my limits, regardless of what others think. I wish I could\\'ve saved her. Been there for her more. Every time I listen to this song I am reminded of her, and her everlasting kindness, and good heart, no matter what she was feeling. She was truly selfless. So I say to you, scrolling through the comments, STAY SAFE, STAY HEALTHY, AND STAY ALIVE. YOU ARE LOVED. @a tired little girl trust me read it but he copied it from a different video its still sad though @Mike Thedragon he copied someone elses comment in a different video @im your momma oh yeah he did @im your momma he did @Dikobraz VoliAlkohol i doubt anyone can laugh after reading that I remember when this was a comment section and not a calendar.... Yeah... The \"anyone watching still in ...\" Is quite dumb. But there are a bunch of comments that I read by that aren\\'t calendar. 50% are roughly calendar comment imo. I see where you coming from.

Probably we are not even living in the same country. We look different. You may be older than me or younger. We are just completely strangers. But there are a few things which connect us. We are Humans. We have emotions and feelings. A personality which defines us. And we are both on Youtube, searching for sad songs, no matter what’s going on in your life at the moment, you can do it! You can manage out if it, you will stay stronger because there are people who love you. And these people are worth it!! Yes, we are strangers but not too far away from eachother to not say that you are a great Person. Because you are! I hope even if it’s just one of you, that I could help or support you in a way.\\nThis comment is for all the lonely people out there!

I wasnt a fan of him, but by best friend was a huge fan, he loved him. When she learnt that he died she started crying so hard. She stopped hanging out with us for a week. I felt so sad for her, and I understood that he was a important person to her life. Thats why I searched him and I wanted to know more about his personality. Now I am a huge fan too and I just wish him the best. Have a good heaven angel ❤ Same, it’s also sad seeing someone die I’ve spent watching on my childhood tv show I listen to this song most of the times when i cry because I know that I am loved by my girlfriend and my parents but I feel unsafe from now on that I didn\\'t see my girlfriend for 3 months and we reunited but that wasn\\'t the hard part the hard part is that every time she comes to my party she only stays for 1-2 hours and she is the love of my life but why can\\'t she stay longer? my parents doesn\\'t know what I am going through in life only my girlfriend does because we tell everything to each other but not always but we kinda broke up in march because we had so much fights and arguments so yea this is my short story of me and my girlfriend we are hoping to find a place and live together forever. I need new memories with this girl because If she ever finds someone new I would be in depression mode crying all day. so yea if you wanna follow my insta i do not accept xoxo.sereniityyy. so like people hate me saying that i do not talk i do not have a mouth to talk they hate me and even though my girl is loyal doesn\\'t she will be loyal to other girls or boys. sorry if you see this \\'\\' Time doesn\\'t heal anything... It just teaches us how to live with the pain\\'\\'. Lets all be honest..\\n\\nwe searched up “sad songs” on youtube to cry to and this is what came up Yeah i miss mg mom if i listen to this song i always remember her yep but this is sad if you listen closely No Yes ur right XD Yeah One day someone Will feel this comment.\\n\"Without you l feel broke\" I dedicate this song to you my beautiful Vicxy, the girl that will never be mine🥺♥️.

I\\'m single idk why everyday i watch this video, lol.. *i still rememeber when the comment section was normal , not a calender* \"Don\\'t cry because it\\'s over, smile because it happened.\"\\n- Dr. Seuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLol kind of funny how a random person named \"ShrekTheDaddy\" would try to cheer people up on a sad song. Lol Haahahahaha, but nothing has ever happened You made my day 0.0001% better with your name I can’t smile my best friend and I are drifting I only have one other friend and she’s not really my friend my other friend gave me up for popularity and the love of my life doesn’t even know I exist. I am obsessed with Dr. Seuss quotes When you heard this song so many times you don’t even cry anymore..... When you don\\'t cry at all because you\\'ve cried all 17 years of your life, and now you\\'re physically incapable of it.

Yes, you, sitting behind your screen reading this. I don\\'t know you and you certainly don\\'t know me. But I want to tell you something. Everyone has their own story. Yours might be filled with joy and happiness, or it might be clouded with pain and misfortune. I want you to know that you\\'re a beautiful, wonderful, talented person. Even if your life isn\\'t going the way you want it to right now, I know that you\\'ll be able to make it out alright. I want you to do me a favor. I know I\\'m just a stranger, but just trust me, okay? Every time you see your reflection, be it in the mirror in the bathroom, in a window somewhere, or in a puddle on the street, I want you to look at yourself and give yourself a hug. Because even if you aren\\'t the prettiest or the smartest or the funniest, you\\'re something that no one else can be: you. And you are the greatest thing you can be. Smile at strangers. Be confident in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you feel like laughing. Treat yourself like a god/goddess because you deserve it. Hold your head up and keep your heart open. You\\'re worth everything and then some. And always remember that no matter what, even if it doesn\\'t seem like it, you\\'re everything to someone. I was bullied for so long and was told that I wasn\\'t beautiful, and it broke me down. But I realized that I am beautiful and so is everyone else. I wanted to make sure no one felt upset like I did - hating myself and crying to sleep. You are all special <3 Whenever I hear this song, I remember my late mother because without her I\\'ve got no one to hold, without her I\\'m just a sad song.

Its halarious when egyptian scholars claim they \"know\" the history of egypt, when egypt at the time didnt even know bahahaha No Pharaoh constructed the Sphinx it is pre-dynastic @Neg Ative lol @SurfK9 I was honestly just wondering that very thing. The constellations take an imagination to see in the stars and for all the ancient civilizations to have used the same astrology symbols would be impossible @Raymond Palmer Satan?

That tablet have two Spinx statues. Wonder what became of the other one cause there are several depictions found with 2 of them. Some archeologists speculate that the other Sphinx is still buried beneath the sand.\\nAlso the two sphinxes are guarding archive chambers on that tablet, not just sitting atop a ‘cliff’ like the woman in the video suggests. Nah, man. I think it represents two scenes like in a comic book. The face of the Sphinx was a lion and they changed it to a human face .... this was done 10,000 years ago not 3 Bobby of Gondor check out the pics of when they opened up a Pharoh Tut’s tomb. One of the items was a meduim size gold Anubus Spynx sitting as guardian to the dead. It was a representation of the spynx as it was at his time about 3300 years ago. @Cheef Smokealot No it wasn\\'t Anubis, the tail on the Sphinx is a lion tail, not a jackal tail.  Possibly it could have also been a Griffen sphinx?. I think the sphinx was Anubus, not a lion. 99.99999% graffiti like becuase this video is 4 minutes and 20 seconds long #420 yes, THIS. Free da Wead 🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0073\\U000e0063\\U000e0074\\U000e007f🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0073\\U000e0063\\U000e0074\\U000e007f 4:20 works for me lol it\\'s predynastic as is the pyramids. 👌 I got married on 4/20/15 if this true, then the ancient Egyptian ppl did not build the sphinx. You mean the modern Egyptians who are not related to ancient Egyptians. @Mystic Mudra why would they though? it means nothing for them, but it means a lot for the egyptians. and theres a huge chance that egyptians built this, because they were very good with construction. @Berihan Abdelsadek Atlantean Empire who did then Red Pill Nation You do not need that many years for something to be forgotten and ”rediscovered”. more likely he wanted to take credit for an already ancient building, this was common practise during this period of time \\u200b@TheRealBaxterslider What evidence? The Wadi al-Jarf papyri disproves everything you say or have. You didn\\'t watch the video... @TheRealBaxterslider sigh @Kassandra I was referring to the process of rulers changing documents and buildings to glorify themselves, it was common practice, so aging them can be difficult. Cheops didn\\'t build the great pyramid, there is evidence Enoch did What do you mean?  If he wanted to take credit for it wouldn\\'t he have TAKEN CREDIT FOR IT instead of saying, \"Hey.  I found this ancient building that I didn\\'t build and therefore can\\'t take credit for\"? the Great Sphinx was built by Thoth. that\\'s over 45,000 years ago hence the Emerald Tablet & these people were JET BLACK IN COLOR. Donald J from my understanding the black cat is Sekhmet. If memory serves me correctly. The emerald tablet of Thoth speaks about her. Please excuse the late reply, I just seen this comment What was the pharaoh\\'s black-cat named..? I’m convinced the Egyptians stumbled upon all of these ruins, and clear the sands away and reused all of those structures  and in many cases tried to restore many,   There is no way ever possible that they cut trillions of tons of stone and brought it from Aswan themselves     Only a much older culture with lost technologies could have done so... we can’t even do this today Asian monks cut stone slabs by playing long notes on giant horns in unison. Americans arent taught alot of what the rest of the world knows. Our captors keep us ignorant through control of the media and schools. Teach yourselves Yes we can. There is a video of a man moving giant stone like these... on his own. Can you imagine if the Sphinx was buried and ruined 1300b.c how old it really is!!Ii think that before the flood ancient civilisations were very advanced,just the damages from the apocalypse destroy the technologies,knowledge and the survivors had to start all over again!! The older building was done with precision and using monolithic sized rock , the older the more abilities we see ?\\nThe polygonal rock layering is a unknown art today , we cannot figure how they could measure all those angles and cut the sides to fit so many angles !\\nThis was done before the Egyptians existed ! The Sphinx was directly carved on the rock of a quarry below ground level. Near the water table. This is why it has water erosion. The Sphinx was mostly carved after 3000 B.C. That\\'s because it was built by the Nephilim and then buried by the great flood. @Michael Fisher \\U0001f9a7 Nephilim never existed. SineMacula 1911 it wasn’t but k @Jeremy Kirkpatrick *M G T O W*  *B A T M A N* Sure it was In frame .15 hen you view the Sphinx from behind, the rock feature to the left looks like it was a sphinx also, now very eroded. It is possible the awesome sphinx had a partner. A lot of statues/monuments are doubled. Great to know the truth.\\xa0 There seems to be practice small scale versions of other things built around there. Outside the pyramid you can see a smaller pyramid but built to a smaller scale but it even has the tunnels etc inside. Almost like a blueprint I guess. It\\'s how they found some of the missing tunnels. Shame they won\\'t explore all of them I have just read that Sphinx\\'s engravings were made in secured  places which were protecting a monument so they were using the sphinx as a symbol of guarding in greek, roman and egyptian civilizations. It did not make much difference as it was under sand at the end of 1800 . The wall are no protection from desert sand . The wall was built to control ancient tourists and keep them in line. AC: O anyone? Thutmose slew his brother to maintain power. The Thutmose Stella is an indicator of the age of the Sphinx . I wonder how well we know of what is under the sand .  at 4:02 time you can see what lies beneath the sphinx he is set on a very high foot that has never been dug out, why not? Explain all The Sphynx is a tribute to Joseph from the people of the earth that he had saved from starvation during the seven year famine. He had also created the great pyramid as a covenant from the Isrealites to the Egyptians. His son Manasseh had been one of the first discoverers of the americas and his descedants are known as the other half tribe of Manasseh,the lost tribe of Israel. Full Blown TRUTH Attraction <<   Not a Full Blown Tourist one . \\nBecause Tourists always Needs a Guide < \\nBut Who else can be your Guide if not yourself ? He saw the head.  Or maybe someone he knew.  Imagined there could be more beneath.  That imagination came forth into a dream while sleeping.  Whether he or whoever he knew, though the Pharaoh took credit, became convinced us a body under the sand.  I think this is highly likely.  No evidence?  Nope.  Just the same imagination it took to imagine that head had a body.  The same imagination that has brought us this far. me after the sphynks has kept its word  *goes and sleeps infront of it waiting for the dream XD Honestly can never believe anything that comes from the illuminati smithsonian \\nThey hide more truth than they reveal\\nHumbug and hogwash or similair as Harry Potter would say 🤡 Absolutely no part of what they highlight in black says Thutmose; it says Mn Khpru Ra. Very disingenuous. The cartouche is his throne name. There would Sa Re (duck and sun)  before the name if they presented the birth name. Same dude, but I guess you know it (cause you can read the cartouche) and just decided to nitpick? :D Egyptians built huge structures, but they were influenced by existing massive structures of a forgotten Advanced civilization. For intance, the Djoser Step Pyramid in Saqqara was an attempt by Ancient Egyptians to build a pyramid, but they failed totally. I know he wasn\\'t white! Or arab! He was the original black man. Bs this monumental structure was built 12000 years ago no Egyptian had any envolment on the construction @Dael Anthony The Europeans who came to central America also believed that White people had to be the ones who built the Mayan pyramids😂😂😂 That\\'s just how BIGOTS think. Dael Anthony but most stuff were already know in the ancient world my hybrid fool 😂😂 Clarence Mack you clearly have no knowledge of the time line of evolution. @Mike Smith White people for sure dude. Kindly point out the construction achievements of the blacks on this planet. I can say no white person did it for sure , they white people that is just recently learned how to walk up right. And in Romania we\\'ve got a Sphinx and we don\\'t know nothing about why,when,who buildid..... for NADIA COMENEITCH! The  Sphinx  spoke and said take my head of a lion and carve on your  own and by the way Tut make sure you  demolish  my twin because  everyone  will  know what  you  did. Like all liars have  eventually  their  noses rubbed  off. Ningishzidda. there finally got it right. Thutmose was in line to become Pharaoh anyways. lol The face on the sphinx was human.  See 4:04 minutes into video. Bill Dumke Yes, in greek mythology  she was a female lion but with wings. She asked people a question,a riddle. Then if they didn\\'t know the answer, she strangled them(hence sfiggw,σφίγγω = to strangle) They used 3D printer to make the pyramids? no? KODAK? LOL? It’s at least old enough for water erosion to have taken effect so obviously we still don’t know. I thought that after an insightful video, it had to end with such an blase blah comment...that it evolved into such a tourist attraction. So Tutmose saved the Sphinx and was promissed to become king. Except there is a problem: the curent king is Tutmose\\'s brother. To keep his promise the Sphinx made sure the king dies lol I\\'d bet that it was Game Of Thrones style. Tutmose killed his brother for sure the sphinx has the face of a black Nubian Who\\'s going to pay for the wall? THE EGYPTIANS!! Hahaha evidence? 3:32 Tutmos killed his brother lol Britt V yes we can laugh about that. Brittney, drugs are bad ... um kay.    *M G T O W*  *B A T M A N* 👍👍👍. . . I ❤ a good history lesson. 📚 welcome Like it’s so old you don’t know if the wall was built at the same time or hundreds of years after and I don’t think they really know what all has been added and taken away over time. It’s a cool mystery though. Great video thanks for sharing this with those who are your fans Puro ganar con\"\"\"\" jesus \"\"\"\" !!!!!!! Guaranteed the Smithsonian has known the true history of our world for a long time but have kept this knowledge for themselves and their friends all while feeding us (the common man) lies. so tabloid news soooooo....how long would it take to let nature bury that fake sphinx ? (no wings, hence its no sphinx therefor fake) To learn much more about the cycle of civilizations, recurring floods and ancient high tech, read the ebook \"what I know about Nibiru\" Just search for: know nibiru Those is Arab? Lol.ok The Spinx is a lion the symbol of the Anglo with Shems face carved into it.\\nThere are 3 sphinx One in Egypt for Shem\\nAnother in Nigeria for Japheth\\nRecent find in Pakistan for Ham\\n The sphinx are lion tribal markers nothing more nothing less.\\nWhy is is only the Anglos started to unbury thier past when no one gave a s**t for centuries.( Napoleon Germans petre ) One in Romania. What kind of story is that u tellin? Neva heard tht one They don\\'t look Arab to me Why everybody forgetting about that invasion smh TIM ALI arabs are mix breed of em The pharoah would be so upset with what\\'s happening in Egypt right now ...   I think whoever built the Sphinx orignally would also be very upset what the pharao did... How foolish the human is !!!\\n\\nthe sphinx is offering kingdom - though it\\ncan not even clean itself from sand !!! NO? Just Curious! nothing wrong with that Brother! I thought it was Khufu This entire series is wonderful, but they all could have been 5 minutes long. Lovely productions. Thoth, i, made this beauty. It was built for me today.

Yes,it is,no one build the Sphinx,it is existed in pre-date history,same existing as Pyramids of Gaza or dinoaaurs or giants stage and a ancient catalysm happened in unknown time,wide out majorities of species on Earth and process Ice-age and modern human being started its civilization over again in unknown time period.The original languages of ancient Egyptian is guide by a wolf to a ancient ruins or tombs full of unknown writing and 40 tons of sarcophagus make of unknown compounds,those kind of strange writing on walls and ceiling became what later on Egyptian called hieroglyphs from Old and new Stone age,the hieroglyphs consist lot of UFO,ET forms.Actually speaking Sphinx looks like a lion or wolf status and dynastic period which is Bronze age,ancient Egyptian to honor the Lion or Wolf as Sekthmet God and Anibus===God of tombs,Pharaoh is a smart person,in order to avoid many question raised by people later on,therefore building those \"Step-Pyramids\"to cover up the truth behind those megalithic block of limestone,bed rocks,granite ,diorite,dacite with quartz, compounds.People in nowadays can compare the building skills,technique and compounds,which is another advance level,those mud bricks are from the local soil to make up,compare the megalithic block of stones,the hardest one on Earth in modern time value,the granite is 7,the iron or steel age or diamond age is 10 at all.Strongly believe ,there is a missing chapters of modern human being evolution and civilization. Didn\\'t you just say it was Khufu? So black statues,but white Pharoahs? Oh ok @TIM ALI  The people where more of african heritage for sure during this earliest civilization ( the sphinx one). There were only blacks on the continent in that time. The only thing we need to know although is whether the Sphinx is 10000 years old or maybe even older. the discussion is not whether it were blacks whites the discussion is that the sphinx was much older than the dynasties and from a much older civilization.Why always bring in that race debate.  You don\\'t even look black yourself.  Have you ever been to Egypt.  You see that there are people of very dark complexion and lighter complexion.  The discussion here is about an older civilization and that the pyramids were anything but tombs more like power plants that could conduct electricity. Oh man...Stil relying on this fake Egyptologiy....That the sphinx is much older then the egyptian civilization is known for long time. All this national geographic bs is debunked as misseducating as they trynna keep up the fake story\\'s bout ancient high civilization Egypt which was built up by stones n chisel....n the pyramids are tombs for the ego if the rulers.... Yeah.. Yo I’m barley getting into all this \\n\\nWhy ppl saying it was found by the Egyptians \\nAnd this water theory Obviously this doppy \"Egyptologist\" has no understanding of Human Psychology.  Of course the Prince is going to have this dream, it reinforces his claim to the throne. With that dream \"\"up your sleeve\" you can afford to bump off your elder brother, and grab the throne ! The more interesting implication is of course that the Sphinx pre-dates the Egyptian Pharaohs, as it is known that the Sphinx head has been re-carved at least once. Thoth ship is buried under the Sphinx Well I read a lot of people’s ideas about these mysteries in this video and the explanation of how it was built, when it was built, the reason it was built, and the significance of it. The only true source of writing material which everyone gives no head to is a King James Bible. And it gives revelation to all mysteries but a lot of scientist don’t believe the Bible and scholars don’t believe it and most think it’s outdated and archaic. Well my friends let me tell you I’m none of those type I am a Bible believer and a preacher and God the Lord Jesus Christ has showed my some very interested revelation. First of all the pyramids have a function one is it is a mathematical clock and points to something most overlook. If you read in Isaiah 19:19 it says there is an altar built unto the Lord on the border of Egypt. The Sons of God built the Giza monument back 12,000 years ago to give us a message before the earth was dropped to the bottom of the universe the sons of God built it to magnify The lord Jesus Christ. The Bible says he is the capstone and it’s missing on Giza it was made of solid gold. It also was built inside to tell us about the revelation of the creation the fall of Lucifer the satan before the recreation in Gen 1:1:2 the fall was the earth fell to the bottom of the universe and satan fell with it. The message of the pyramid points to the Orion constellation with the Sphinx being the lion it drops down from the Giza position to point to m42 the Orion Nebula why? Well I know why it’s the most important message to all but most never read scripture look into m42 it’s so bright read Job he tells about it plus only the Lord almighty mentions Orion no body knew it’s name until God spoke to job about it. Why. Well I know why let me put it this way. John 14 6 say. I am the way the truth and the life no man comes the the Father but by me. Jeremiah 4- 4 talks about a preadamic earth no man was on this earth the Sons of God angelic beings they built mathematically with the message and the number PI oh well enough said it’s plain to see the Bible is the final authority hope you read it Ed Wilson the bible, lol.  Thats factual No pharaoh or king had nothing I say nada in this ! The Sphinx is 10 thousand years old Mabey older due to water floods on the walls , the only time ancient E had lots of water was during the floods .... No it\\'s not water erosion that\\'s a myth. The erosion was caused by heat - they used fire to soften the stone for quarry they then used for the pyramids. \\u200b@Dael Anthony typicall guy you thinks he knows everything. So in your opinion what age got the Sphinx? You\\'re so smartass, than knows jack about Geology, and the fact that the Sphinx was underground for centuries. Go dig  a hole, and put in there a mud brick, and watch what gonna happen to it, in a year. He gonna be eroded by underground water. \\u200b@Dael Anthony so you must be one of those with the \"alien argument\". Aliens travelled years on deep space to arrive in Earth to show humans how to stack rocks? You\\'re just despise the intelligence of our human ancestors? There no aliens...just human intelligence. Read more about the pyramids from other ancient cultures like the Sumerians. If there was a Sphinx before 8000B.C.....you can be sure other ancient cultures like the Sumerians, would had describe it. @RogerM Been reading about this for over 40 years, Travelled there several times. Have stood between his paws. Is that enough for you? Just a couple of things. It wasn\\'t carved on a quarry. The rock removed from the enclosure was used in the construction of the temple. The Giza plateau is constructed on top of an aquifer. The water erosion on both the enclosure and the Sphinx is vertical. Which geologists now conclude is from precipitous water. Not from a rising and falling water table as you seem to be alluding to.  Don\\'t know what you\\'ve been reading but I wouldn\\'t recommend it. @Dael Anthony go read more. I BELIEVE THE ARCHAEOLOGIST\\'S WHO HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE SPHINX IS MUCH MUCH OLDER, 30 TO 40000 YEARS OLD. FROM A TIME WHEN THE NILE FLOOD PAST THE BASE OF THE SPHINX, AND RAINFALL AND PLANT LIFE WE\\'RE PLENTIFUL THERE. MAKING THE SPHINX EVEN MORE INCREDIBLE AND INTRIGUING.

Sure is a racist mind set Whites always gotta be the speaker I guess TIM ALI they want to re write history Why are you so racist? Everyone is the same, dude.

Clearly just an added Adobe wall around an already existing of magha lithic structure رائد جدا Ningishzida. sorry first was a misspell Hello, anyone ever heard of TERRAFORMING! Yes have you? I believe the pyramids in combonation with the ARC of the COVENANT were used to generate free wireless electricity wich helped make earth a habital planet. They would also probably allow us protection to travel thru a black hole. Just a thought! If flood waters were slowly rising . Like if the atmosphere was warming causing rising oceans. Would you not build a wall around your most precious buildings . Actually built by The Anunnaki after the flood. No humans were used. The builders face (Ningiszidda) was put on the Sphinx. Later replaced with the face of Asar. @Mic Neg knowledge is endless, I find that anything I read after The Lost Book I am going backwards.

You\\'re hilarious dude @Francois Davis who? Are you referring to yourself More probably vandalised by the black man Why did Napoleon shoot off the nose of the sphinx answer that question He didn\\'t its a myth but people who don\\'t research still fall for it NAPOLEON SHOOT THE NOSE OFF BECAUSE IT WAS BLACK MAN NOSE. The Egyptians had nothing to do with the building of the sphinx or the pyramids. they where already there and so they used them carving their ancient graffiti on them. Looking at how degraded the body of the Sphinx was compared to the head that had been above ground it is plainly obvious that the head has been re carved at some point. the stone is too new compared to the rest of it.. It was probably the head of a lion to start with but the vain Egyptian rulers had it carved in their likeness.... so bored! No es que el vídeo sea aburrido sino que cuando lo termine estaba aburrida y escribí algo por así decirlo The Smithsonians know this is complete and utter nonesense. \\nWhy don\\'t they show us what they found in the spynx, or the skeletal remains of the giants.\\nThey\\'re hiding so much from us, its a crime against humanity. that is a beautiful lady 💋 Thanks makes me feel good kiss 💋 I\\'ve been watching people of Gambi all day for hours and found this Smithsonian liars!!!

       " 'ovaj serijal je za djecu do 12 god,ali za odrasle koji su ovo prosli je jako smijesno  lol Brate ide trajtor💪 1995 u nekakvom četničkom štabu Titova slika, koja usrana propaganda, koji usrani šupčina od režisera. Gotovona najveći švaler u ovoj sapunici. Jebe se njega. Žena mu u Kolumbiji, a on već s novinarkom i zove ovu vojnikinju na večeru i kaže da će ju zaprosit. Švaler u prazno...hhh... U 8. epizodi su se srpski oficiri toliko iznapijali da su brkali - ekavicu i - ijekavicu. 😁😁😁😁😁 Jedva cekam 8 epizodu @ria mia mislim da je sinoć bila. I ta 8.epizoda je zadnja epizoda. Kad je? Je li u ratu bilo ikakvo žensko, da išta valja, da Gotovina nije povalio :D Da \"Di ste moji dragovoljci? Ha ha ha\" U ratu se nikad nije koristila riječ \"Dragovoljac\"  još samo gledam hoće li Kolinda od nekle istrčati . Odvratno! @Marko Jurić to ti moze sve moj otac potvrdit, to sta ti ne vjerujes to je tvoj problem @Bijeli Crni tako je @Miko Komunjara Primorci a ne dragovoljci 😂😂 Tako su mome starom rekli, digli ga u 3 ujutro zvali ga na telefon da mora u vojsku, kad došo tamo kaze general vi ste dragovoljci Covek je samo  radio svoj posao I to veoma dobro.Rat nikome nije doneo dobro.Civilno stanovnistvo bilo kojev vere.stradalo je uzalud majke zavijene u crnini DECA sirocad.Dok tadasnji presednici zajedno ispijaju viski.Ne ponovilo se vise nkada.Nek. bar buduce greneracije zive u slozi ne vodeci se idejama politicara. Postujem gospodina gotovinu sposoban general kao nas dudakovic Tragedija Jel ko primjetio pukovnikov Gucci Neseser na 3:28? Seljana a svaka ti dala,proplakah:) Da  a fil je film Čovek ima stila...mnogi nemaju...hhhhh... AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I da li se meni ucinilo ali kad je rekao cuvajte cast hrvatskog branitelja da je krenuo da se krsti sa tri prsta? Lično kao dijete od 14 godina sam prosao Oluju, otisao kako to vi kažete traktrijadom. Naravno Republika Hrvatska je imala pravo da taj dio teritorije RSK vrati pod ustavno pravni okvir svoje države shodno medjunarodnom pravu. Ono sto mi se ne svidja je to, na koji nacin je uradila i sto sam ja morao otici iz svog sela pored Knina.  Neki mi rekli pa možes se vratiti, ali gdje i u sta, nije nimalo jednostavno. Pratim seriju od pocetka, ono sto se tiče Gotovine, imao je i tada postovanje Srba, a i danas sa obzirom na njega kao čovijeka i ratnika, te je stoga sigurno zaslužio bolji film ili ti seriju od ovog kako je prikazano. Omalovazavanjem njegovih protivnika, naroda i vojske tog područja kao razularane bande, umanjen je njegov rejting vojskovodje.. Rado i često dodjem u Republiku Hrvatsku i kada bi nekad sreo Gotovinu na moru pruzio bi mu ruku sa poštovanjem koji je zaslužio, bez obzira što smo mi morali otici, no on tome nije kriv, krivi su drugi,  Milošević, a potom i Tudjan, general je samo radio svoj posao časno ispostavilo se. Za šta mu se sudilo za prekomjerno granatiranje Knina i dr., ma dajte, sto niko nije niko optužen za prekomjerno granatiranje Vukovara. Svaki bosanski grad je primio vise granata nego Knin toga 04.08. U mom selu na vise odvojenih lokacija  neposredno nakon zavrsetka operacija Oluje ubijeno je desetine civila, na žalost niko i nikad za to neće odgovarati, ali ni to se ne može pripisati komadnoj odgovornosti. Iako ne živim vise u njoj, Hrvatska je moja domovina, bez obzira što sam Srbin.. Nikad niko više ne morao ratovati Bože ti pomozi.. @John a sta je oluja bila, isli ste sa cvecem u rukama, a narod se uplasio od cveca pa pobegao... ajde neserendaj, nego cuti tu i uzivaj u lazima kako ste vi dobri i fini, a Srbi ubice! @milos obilic Nitko vas nije puškom tjerao iz kuća, sami ste naredili evakuaciju stanovništva... @milos obilic \"ispada da vas ima duplo vise nego sta vas ima\" - čovjek u sukobu s elementarnom realnošću @John koliko si naveo proteranih hrvata ispade da vas ima duplo vise, nego sto vas ima... Ajd ne serendaj, niko nije proterao kao sto ste vi Srbe iz Krajine  organizovano i planirank najvece proterivanje jednog naroda sa zemlje gde su vekovno ziveli. @Mislav Ivkovic nažalost to nije istina , u mom selu ko je ostao , ostao je i bez glave . Čak i baba od preko 80 god . Hoćeš imena pa provjeri ? Zivijela Hrvatska bravo generale Gotovina nasa diko✌👏👏👏👏 MILE TI GOSPE...... 43:39 ovaj lik u seriji malo priča ekavicom malo ijekavicom po scenama.Što se ne odluči kako će :D Jao, daktilografkinja kija vodi visokoumne razgovore i vojnik iz Knina koji prica ekavski??? Koji falsifikati i izmisljotine. A oboje pricaju zagrebackim naglaskom @janka pusta a je baš zvuče ko Srbi.Oni Kerekeš bar donekle ,a oni dvoje pričaju hrvatski ko i ja .Samo je ubacio kasarnu i tačke E a nisi skužil da glumac Goran Višnjić glumi Gotovinu, a ne sam Gotovina. Da je serija snimana 2017-2018 a ne od 1991-1995. Ja sam mislil da je to ko u Big Brotheru, da njih kamere prate uživo a ti gledaš uz čips doma. I daj mi reči kaj je to Zagrebački naglasak. Hvala unaprijed. Najbolja epizoda. Jedina razlika izmedu ovog \"genijalnog\" uradka i Rtl trasha \"Krv nije voda\" je sto ovdje glume profesionalci a tamo naturscici..ukupni dojam ales zussamen- prestrasno..stvarno smijesno tj.tragicno da se nije moglo snimiti nesto kvalitetnije!? \\nNasi filmovi kronicno su liseni humora,lezernosti i originalnosti, uvijek isti glumci, iste spike, los scenarij, i tona patetike 🤮 Stvarno sta je je film je sranje srbi bi to napravili vrh jer su rodjeni za glumu u svemu apsolutno se slažem. Trash uzduz i popreko, sad puno više cijenim one sve glumce iz tih šit sranja. A vidi vjetrenjače iznad glinice na 34:30 😂 Ajde miĆi, bre....dok je još na vreme! Hahahahaha....pa jebote ovo je zabavno... Македонац сам и живим у иностранству Хрвати ми не сметају ни мало али наравно Србија ми је дража ништа лично 😁 Imam ja prijatelja makedonca i on misli drugacije ,al nema veze @rikardo ferrara89 \\nTvoja i vase seke ih obozavaju Ma ko voli hrvate nikad cuo @Bay Ridge pozzz brate Bez brige Makedonce, pa naravno, istok i zapad kao da mjesas sljive i narance..... pozdrav brate.....Hrvat ovdje Odoh ja gledat\\' bitku na neretvi. Dosta kvalitetniji rad. @Tigar1881 Tiger ma triba san. Zašto ne? Da i dalje glumite da ste uvijek bili nevini? Nisi triba ni dolazit vamo na generalovu seriju ,ostani tamo i ne vracaj  se @Jeroni Mo Jo junaka.A obuka si se u babu 95 kad ste bižali @Sir Lancelot ti si dokaz kakvi ste neljudi. Savjesti nula @Jeroni Mo aj ulij  goriva u traktorče.Trebat će Kakav lurac pd serije 31:52 kad puknes pukni sa stilom Borko Petrić -\"Nikica\"\\n\\nSrbin Kakva komedija...pa ovo je super... \"Kako su precizni kao da ih rukama bacaju, čuvaju civilne kuće, valjda za povratak\" 🇭🇷Ne mogu vjerovati da se i u ovom jeftinom filmu još nekome ulizujete!!  Fuuuj! 🇭🇷Br dragovoljac d.r.🇭🇷 koje sranjeeeeeeeee sta ovo nema po 100 epizoda kao turske serije 46:53 mamutica ali krajiška verzija... Ne serite . 200.000 ste ih istjerali za jedan Dan 04.08.1995 . Gdje je 700 Mlade vojske nestalo iz kasarne 5.8.1995 u kninu Dica iz vrtića pucaju od smija.\\nAko gledaju ovu sapunicu.\\nE moj Vrdoljak u što si ubra godine. kad izlazi osma? Prvi Dobra Mozak operacije, Gen. Stipetic, izbjegnut.\\n  Ovo ko nije HDZ, ne moze ni u autobiografsku igranu seriju? Da,istina jedan od najvećih Kad je 8epizoda prelosa gluma, prica ekavicom pa pocne ijekavicom...slavonci pocnu pricati dalmatinski...uzas Generalu reći Šefe!??? Ovo je dno Ništa vi niste osvojili ,dogovorili se Tuđman i Milošević i izdao krajinu,ginuli ste za Džabe ❤🙏 Romansirano jest, ali ovakve stvari treba snimati. Mislim da bi svi trebali praviti serije i filmove koji velicaju pobjede svoga naroda\\nAli ljudi sta je ovo .... Koje ova glumica na 42:25 @Ask Vic hvalaa👍 Milica ... Olga Pakalovic mobiliziralo starog Janka a on na tviteru,boli ga kundak Nepokoreni grad ili mačak pod šljemom? Daj nek mi neki Srbi ovdje reču dali se i oni ovako mole svom bogu u vojsci. Ako da šta se onda čudimo što se Jugoslavija raspala. Pozdrav od ateista. Što bi neko dole reko u komentarima Idem i ja gledat Neretvu. Nemaš koga pozdravljat,ovdi ti nema bas ateista Nisam neki Srbin, al znam da dokle god ovi što se mole pričaju da se Jugoslavija raspala Jugoslavija je na sigurnom. Veze oni s Jugoslavijom nemaju. \\n\\nOdoh i ja gledat Neretvu...da obnovim gradivo. :) Jel još jedna epizoda ima Jos jedna Super dobra serija ..hvala na postavci .Pozdrav svima dobrim ljudima, kao i ekipi  i zanemarite & ohladite vise od glupog prepucavanje Ok..! 🍁💕🍷🥂👌🍁 😂😂😂😂 Danas u toku dana ide 8 zadnja epizoda 37:17 Gotovina se krsti po pravoslavni! Om Loša kopija zamišljenog orginala😉 Šupljeee šupljee loše,kontradiktorno,šteta Mustafa je veliki glumac,ali pate su pare,a bolest ga ruši Sve Srbi glume,osim dva muslimana Jedva cekam kad ce osma epizoda sranje film kako i ne bi bio kad nikad niste nikakvog junaka dali ili se racuna pranje germanskih stala ??? @Elvis Jukić moguće da ti je otac bio u ratu , samo neznam na čijoj strani. Bog i Hrvati !!!\\nPS.nitko, nikoga ne goni da nešto gleda ,ako mu se ne sviđa. @Mihovil Glavota I Hrvati su... @Antonio Toninjo Moj tata je bio u ratu i ovo ga je sram gledati... Bogu hvala vi srbi ste prepuni heroja i junaka sve od arkana pa do seselja  heroj do heroja. Dok smo mi toliko godina ratovali sa turcima ,vi ste im služili \\nTurske sluge AxaxA krsti se po pravoslavnom axaxa su bre to Ante Koja glupost od serije, ni i od istine komplet... Odlicna gluma. Ako nije pao neki oskar, stvarno je nepravda :) Jbt, koji je kurac Mustafi Nadarevicu? Ja sam mislio da je on bolji glumac. Je li on u ovoj seriji glumi Izeta ili Bobetka? Da,Bobetko,odličan je on glumac ali je scenario Karina a i nema s kim?!!! Sve u svemu, dobra epizoda ! HVO I HB🤝🏳️\\u200d🌈🏳️\\u200d🌈🏳️\\u200d🌈🏳️\\u200d🌈\\n❤️❤️HOS❤️❤️\\n❤️⚜️🇧🇦🇭🇷⚜️❤️ @Leonardo Dogan naravno @Leonardo Dogan MI SMO U RBIH IMALI OSLOBODILAČKI RAT BIĆE BOSNE I POSLIJE VAS!🇧🇦❤️⚜️☪️🕋☝️🙏 svi ratovi su prokleti ,ne postoji sveti rat. kace 8 epizoda Ništa @Lucatoni Čule a dobro hvala Serija je svakog ponedeljka Uzevši u obzir budžet, koji je bio najveci u povijesti hrvatske filmografije, serija je malo razocarala po scenskom, glumačkom i redateljskom karakteru. Trebali su se puno bolje pripremiti, uzivjeti u likove, raspitati o povijesnim cinjenicama i slicno, no to je prava slika ovog drustva. Redatelj vrdoljak, nepotizam, raspolaze nasim novcem I TO LOŠE. Ali, da nebude sve tako tmurno, s druge strane bar imamo jedan film koji donekle prikazuje strasnu okupaciju i bol od strane agresora i to ne treba nikad zaboraviti, ali oprostiti DA. Nekako imam osjecaj da je ova generacija znatno pametnija i modernija i necemo nasjedati na provokacije i pranje mozga politicara i nadam se da ratova vise nece biti. Kao sin branitelja, i krscanski odgojeni hrvat, necu govoriti Bog i Hrvati, nego živjele sve nacije i sve vjere dovjeka u miru, sreci i ljubavi. @Boris nazalost, buzet ti danas nije indikator koliko je ulozeno u produkciji nego koliko je otislo nekome u vlastiti djep ili koliko neefikasno se radilo. Kad vec usporedjujemo, gledaj u kojoj kvaliteti za 3000eur mala ekipa danas moze snimit cilu svadbu, ukljucujuci par kadrova sa dronom i ukljucujuci 3 dobre montaze na trailerskom nivou od 3min onda ti sve ovo lici sumljivo. Sta se tice tog EU-spota, tipicno bez natjecaja i upetljani su osobe koji su vec i prije na cudan nacin upravljali sa sredstvima HAVCa. 🤷🏻\\u200d♂️ a nadaj se, vjeruj mi ove novije generacije uza sav internet i sve su još zatupljenije od ovih koji su ratovali tada, i da je do njih još prije bi se ratovalo (jer neznam kako drugačije objasnit toliku zadojenost i mržnju prema srbima i jugi od strane onih koji su rođeni nakon svega, koji nisu živjeli ni u jugi a nit se mogu sjecat rata) jedino što se vremena mjenjaju pa su sve manje šanse za jedan takav vid rata koji definitivno spada u prošlo stoljeće, ali ko zna šta nas još ćeka, sad nas osvajaju ekonomijom a ne puškama a to je po meni puno gori oblik ratovanja kad je redatelj ono govno hdzevsko SRANJE OD SERIJE ZNA AE TK O JE BI O PRAVI GENERAL ZUKOV KAD JE 8000 KM NEMCE SMRVIO DOSAO U MINHEN I SVE IH POBIO POSLE STALJINGRADSKE BITKE Ok scena-srpski oficir priča ekavicom a Titova slika mu visi u kancelariji...šta je Vrdoljak hteo reći.da srbi vole zagorca ??? @Goran Vuletic ne Da @Antonio Toninjo nisi svatio..1995 je godina,Vrdoljak je hteo reći da su srbi komunisti..i da svi srbi pričaju ekavicom..da su to neki srbijanci....neki sa strane...da su ti šumadinci naselili krajinu... Možda ga nisu voljeli,ali su mu se uvlačili u guzicu .

Mora se znati istina....pripadnici HV i vojne policije su u Splitu, u hotelu Duilovo, čuvali apartmane i stvari pripadnika JNA, dok su njihove domove JNA i Srbi raketirali i rušili i pljačkali i ubijali i silovali najmilije. Laž, nije istina.Takve neistine su plasirali Srbi u svojoj ratno huškačkoj mašineriji.Stanovi su bili zaključani sa kompletnim stvarima i čuvali su da ih netko ne pokrade. Nikome od stanara pripadnika JNA koji su bili smješteni kompleksu Duilovu ne fali niti jedna najmanja sitnica. Čast i moral hrvatske vojske na najvišem nivou. Da. Naravno istina je da su cuvali kako bi oni mogli podijeliti plijen a ne netko drugi Smrdljivi Srbo-Komunisti su pokvarili dojam svojim kukavičlukom na kraju rata 95god., kada su bježali na trktorima preodjeveni u ženske haljine pri čemu su čak i gazili svoje od straha!! ZDS @Mislav Ivkovic trebali ste 1918. stati uz bok Austriji i Madjarskoj... @srbijasrbima76 nama je s Austrijom i Madjarskom bilo super i  sad  nam je  u EU to je najveća povijesna greska hrvatske države stat uz bok diktatora KRALJA Aleksandra zato molim vas nemojte nas \" spasavat od nikoga\" stanite u svoju državu ili ako vec zivite u Hrvatskoj a manjina ste ponasajte se kao gosti ne kao begovi i sve Ce bit super osim ako opet ne zelite traktorijadu @srbijasrbima76 🚜🚜🚜🚜 @blaz kosicMa naučili bježat kao na Kosovu polju, kada su postali turski vazali(sluge).. hehe, naučili od tvog Usranog Doguznika. Odluka nije njihova kao ni jedna do sad,to je sve Milosevic.To znaci da je Milosevic izdao jer da je hteo da posalje Vojsku Jugoslavije sjebala bi vas Srbija za 1 dan i vi to dobro znate.Lako je kurciti se da ste pobedili malenu Krajinu ako ste te tolike mudonje zasto niste presli granicu i napali Srbiju?Zato sto ste znali da bi vas Srbija i Srbijanci isprasili da ne bi znali gde ste. Miroslav Todorović zato sto mi ne uzimamo tuđu zemlju jer je NASA naj lijepša Teški zločinci odgovorni za ubijanje nevinih ljudi koji ništa nisu krivi, sve zarad patriotizma i domoljiblja. Kako ti ljudi uveče u opšte spavaju? @Цар Давид jesu političari svi dok narod nema za kruh @Mislav Ivkovic svi su krivi Spavaju jako mirno uz cinjenicu da ste nas napali skupa s JNA sravnili Vukovar sa zemljom a vas nitko nije tjerao niti da pravite RSK niti da ubijate civile po Vukovaru 146000kuca je obnovljeno nakon Oluje koji Srbin je ikad dao kunu ili dinar za obnovu Vukovara Eto srbima neka napadju malo kura Mog je tatu učio gotovina jednom smo ga vidili u pakoštanima ',\n",

I’m from Abbeville just south of Lafayette, so yes.. really normal Yeah it is lol This might sound really weird and random, but Addison kind of looks like a mix between The Merrell Twins and Kim Kardashian. Khloe Kardashian not kim Gigi who ever said I was a bad thing? Naw she dont look like kim k Naw she font Omg your right EVERYONE: social distancing \\nJames: whos that @siiri auroora but it says posted 1 week ago a week ago covid 19 was still a big concern so this was a thing we all were scared of now it has just got worse😁♥️👍 Laila Hurt at that point covid was not big in the us. also james had to keep his channel alive. this is his JOB not just a hobby.

It’s like James barley got a chance to film his OWN video. Aesthetic Blcssom  thank you no body agree with me Addison rae is soo pretty and cute at the end she was soo pretty girl ever Tiktokstar ❤️ Addison Rae is actually like american’s sweetheart or smth Karen Shan addisonraejaden @Maliha S.

For being an angel Gissell Gonzalez uhhh for what...? Seriously! Don\\'t blame them tho. She deserves it :) I feel like james is more comfortable with Addison more than Charli RATS yeah and i think the dance girl with the black hair doesn\\'t think her and james are the same level I think it\\'s cuz Charli is more quiet and kinda more of the listening gal than the talking one and Addison is more bubbly,talking type of gal and she can keep talking and talking.and James is also very talkative so they are similar hence more comfortable with each other and less awkward you get me I need a friend like Addison. She\\'s so bubbly and sociable! Addison: *ow , why do you do it like that* \\nJames: *DONY COMPLAIN* @coffeexdreamer stop trying to be smart you know they meant don\\'t What\\'s a Dony? James does make up to others so effortless! He is gifted! I wish he could do Asian makeups. Everyone who likes this thinks that James Charles should do a random fan’s makeup Sophia Cortez when? Meeeeeeee😉 yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssssss No Rodger Smith why the f are u watching him ur giving him views. ok but everyone is saying that James Charles should do avani\\'s makeup, I think they should do each others ☁︎ Addison is still pretty even when she does not wear makeup @SHEILA QUISHPILEMA sorry 😐 I wanted to reply to.

One of the regular visitor (mother cat) of the house came by one night with her 4 kittens. They started playing in front of my unit. I tried to grab them to play but they are scared and kept on running. Few days by, i notice that out of 4, only 2 was left. Until one day, only one stayed within my place. She was still tiny and no mother to care for her. I was inspired on those people as they forster those left out animals. I tried to feed her with cat food and milk. 6 months later, she is grown healthy. I have uploaded some of her videos on my channel and would appreciate to if you can view her videos.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/cAq4uk4L6i4\\n\\n Looking forward in making more videos.

       " 'I see Amber’s name on a piece, I click. Whether it’s comedy or righteous fury. Always glad I did. me too!! Agreed. Amber\\'s great. Angela IridescenceArtGlass amber need to take the vaccine first then y’all Seth followers follow suit 🇺🇸 That\\'s just the truth ALWAYS \"If you tell Americans it mostly effects black people, folks will be outside in a big pile, french kissing strangers TOMORROW.\"  Like two days after this video went up, a a big pile of white people stormed Michigan and Ohio locations to demand things be opened up because of their right to buy lawn care items and get their hair colored. Simply this. Ané Maya \\nTruer words... @Pamela Cass Florida is ready to reopen tattoo shops, so the trumpherroids can get their next tattoo of Mr. trump!\\nThat\\'s something that just can\\'t wait! FACTS💯 Shawn D Cain AMEN!!!!!!! Literally!!!!! Amber you were dead on on this one, the guy is an absolute idiot. Two weeks ago when he stood up and started to degrade Democrats, as he obviously read the Trump doctrine, I couldn’t believe it, coming from a surgeon general? Then last week he starts comparing the virus casualties to people who smoke and people who take drugs excessively. He’s the surgeon general? Smoking and taking drugs is an option, getting the virus it’s not something you choose to do generally. Once again, Amber, you nailed it. This Guy is an embarrassment, and an obvious Trump stooge You know those Muppets from sesame street, thats what the trash is that has been appointed surgeon general. But he serves his puppet master well. Bren Renn Trump needed a couple of token (controllable)black people in the White House to pretend he’s not racist.  The dude likes his paycheck. Typical company man like the rest of his staff. \"I\\'m right and I don\\'t have time to argue with you about it. People are dying.\"  LOL!  That will be my new line during arguments. @Mickey Rosa sweet! @Mumford Man Me too, love the cauliflower crust pizzas. Yum yum. @Mickey Rosa  Out of the franchise pizzas Pizza Hut is the best but I admit I don\\'t really eat that crap. I like pizzas with cauliflower crust and impossible sausage on top.mmmm mmmmm @Mumford Man None of them are better. Making your own or Diogiorno\\'s Pizza is the best. Those franchise pizzas are truly disgusting. I am so stealing this one too. X \"When you have a job that allows you to work from home, you can stay home. It just so happens that the jobs that have been deemed essential: healthcare providers, bus drivers, subway operators, food delivery people; a lot of these jobs are done by black people and that\\'s messed up in several ways, but I\\'ll just say this. Minorities are dying so people can eat Domino\\'s Pizza in their pajamas. That\\'s effed up!\" @HerculeseFurball Amen... @HerculeseFurball that really fucking chaps... Everyone i know is an essential worker but no one is cheering for us every night\\n\\nLike the ones who work in grocery stores just get people yelling at them if they cough or if the store runs out of eggs Luka Pešun and while everybody is applauding healthcare workers I hope they realize the “essential workers” at McDonalds, Walmart, grocery store etc don’t have a choice and HAVE to work while they are scared of catching the virus. \\nThey have to work because their job isn’t closing and if they don’t go to work they get fired. They can’t quit and collect unemployment. They are basically being forced to endure this hell. \\nI always thank them profusely when I have to go to a store or gas station. I like them all, but yeah, if I look at what\\'s left in my hand and don\\'t see a black one, I think to myself \"Damn, I have to pay more attention to that. I\\'m out of black ones already.\"\\nThey\\'ve got that licorice flavor that\\'s a punctuation mark on the taste buds. A friend of mine sent me an email with what George Takei\\'s (American actor, author, and activist)\\xa0response was to the Surgeon General\\'s (Jerome Adams) warning that last week was going to be \"our Pearl Harbor moment.\":\\n\\n\" Sorry. This isn\\'t our \"Pearl Harbor\" moment. That was a surprise,\\na dastardly attack by an enemy nation.\\xa0This is our \"Chernobyl\" moment\":\\na preventable catastrophe that was\\xa0denied,\\xa0downplayed\\xa0and\\xa0mismanaged\\xa0\\nuntil tens of thousands were dead.\" amber trans? @Caroline Barrett You are a fucking slob. @Conan Bardwell you\\'re a prick 😃 @Caroline Barrett Ohh myyy! @S Lloyd Good for you. This was seriously 4 straight minutes of pure brilliance and hilarity. I love how Amber delivers these insightful, hard-hitting truths in such a way it gets you as the viewer also furious, but then also makes you laugh so it\\'s like a roller coaster of emotions.\\nAlso it\\'s very telling that every talk show host still pauses to wait for audience laughter but Amber had so much to say and was so angry that she filled up every single second so as to make sure that her point got across She\\'s right on point. \\nAlso, on doctor bias: that\\'s exactly why there are more men in the ICU on respirators (and consequentely, higher death rate): when women arrive at the hospital (and even if tested positives), they downplay their symptoms to anxiety/panic attack... and send them homes. \\n(This has been documented already on many other health issues, same process exactly, for heart attacks for instance). @Amy Band Yes but hang on a second Amy. Being a paramedic I find it hard to believe that women are being turned away as people think their symptoms are a result of hysteria. It\\'s not the 1950s and even then coughing and fever would be an odd form of hysteria.\\n\\nFurther to that the data that we do have indicates this virus is more likely to kill men, not by much but consistently. This includes the recent care home data that\\'s being released here in the UK btw.\\n\\nI\\'m not disputing that there\\'s sexism in health care as there are is in all walks of life. Also you\\'re right about the general population of care homes so no dispute there. I also wouldn\\'t dispute you if you said more women by number but less by rate are dying in care homes. But even then its not quite as clear cut as that. \\n\\nBut the claim that women aren\\'t being counted in Covid deaths or that women are being turned away is an extremely bold and credulous claim. As would the claim be that substantively more women are dying of Covid than men. \\n\\nThink about the implications of that actually being true. No offence it just seems like conjecture on your part. I was hoping maybe you could perhaps cite some data to me? Something that specifically relates to covid.\\n\\nAlso, I often feel that with comment sections being so impersonal that sometimes my comments come off as hostile or kind of dickish. Please don\\'t take that to be the case. I am pretty sure you\\'re wrong on this obviously and I just want to see why you think that. But there\\'s no like ill will on my part if that makes sense. @l. kerr The reason I believe that more than half of care home deaths are women is because about 2 thirds of residents are women - not unexpected as women generally live longer, have older or dead husbands. Women are also more likely to be single parents and cannot go into hospital. Deaths at home are not being investigated or counted in most places. @Simon Band Yes but that\\'s more a reflection on the fact that generally there is bias in health care. How does this relate to covid? @Amy Band I mean I was asking a pretty specific question of this other person. But anyway what\\'s your basis for thinking that more than half of care home deaths as well as at home deaths are women. @l. kerr Well actually in most places, the US included deaths are only counted as Covid related if they occur in hospitals as they are not performing usual autopsies to investigate. Deaths in nursing homes ( more often older women) or at home, also more than half women  are not counted in the official tally. This little \\'bit\\' was inspired. She really hit the nail on the head here. Doesn\\'t the word ‘inspired’ has negative connotation? Who the hell was he talking to, children in nursery school? I’d like to say “louder for the people in the back” but the thing is, those people in the back don’t have hearing problems - they have caring problems. You don\\'t care you just want everyone to believe you do. You fraud. Best comment ever...that I so wish wasn\\'t true. 😭 But ya nailed it. Yes! Thank you\\n I couldn\\'t find words but you did It\\'s not often that I applaud a comment, but....👏 I live in a predominantly white gentrified neighbor, chic apartments with a Starbucks inside the lobby. As soon as this news broke out the folks in my apartment literally threw their mask away and are back in the gym, hangin by the pool, etc. In my 4yrs of living here I\\'ve counted maybe 40 other POC here out of I dunno 1000? So things are back to normal, people avoid riding in the elevator with me, move WAY out the way to avoid walking past me, don\\'t make eye contact..etc  oh Lord!  Don\\'t let me wear a mask in the building they act like I have the bubonic plague. Good ole merica All lies All lies All lies <3 Is it possible that \"Jerome\" was actually Get Out\\'d by Chad? Lol Chris Carmona    That was funny. Damn Jerome, why did you have to get up there and patronize us like that? \"Do it for Big Mama?\" Love Amber! She speaks the truth while making me die laughing! So grateful for her. She speaks the White Supremacist Liberal truth. A tenet of systemic racism is denying its existence - highlighting the fruit while pretending there is no tree. I\\'m white and it infuriates me, so I can only imagine how POC feel. Michael Sweeney This isn’t a smart comment. You thought it was, clearly, but it’s not and it isn’t relevant here. also, alcoholics always deny being alcoholic, therefore anyone who says they\\'re not alcoholic MUST be an alcoholic @HM Morgan They should be for any racial group that has been systematically attacked and had their lives limited and oppressed. I don\\'t know why that needs to be argued. Asians were enslaved and interned. The First Nations had the worst genocide in written history committed against them. It\\'s not like reparations are even being doled out and you need to compete for a piece of a finite pie. Sadly, that isn\\'t even on offer. This is simply a moral discussion about what should be. And all POC in the US still have to live under the consequences of the past whether or not their ancestors were slaves. So much should be done that isn\\'t being done, it\\'s not helpful to make so many exclusions. You know that the builders and perpetrators of systemic racism want minorities to hate on each other and be too busy creating more dividing lines to realize where the real enemy is. So, stop playing into it. Reparations was supposed to be for descendants of slaves. Not all People of Color fall into that category. @Neglo Blaxon Reparations should really be for any racial group that has been oppressed, which extends to more than just African Americans. And all non-white persons are subject to racism. So I don\\'t know why you are making this exclusion. \"POC\" is a term POC use and have told me that it is an unoffensive way to refer to those who are affected by racism, i.e. all the various groups that are not \"white.\" White Supremacy is just that - the belief that only white people are superior. So it impacts many different people. Most of the people in the world. So the term is used in that context. I try to take my cues on what is acceptable from the people who have experienced something I have not. So that\\'s what I did here. Amber is a national treasure. I will argue this til the day I die. Awesome girl!!! Yes, yes, yes!! @borot man Yeah right. 😁 @sandorx4 Now you\\'re closer to getting it. Why, indeed. It\\'s almost an entire system that\\'s skewing to racial biases or something. @sandorx4 You\\'re sounding pretty fucking stupid right now. Someone could explain the legacy of redlining and disproportionate policing to you, but I\\'m sure it would be lost on someone so dedicated to ignoring systemic problems in the US. I’m with you on Pizza Hut. And so glad you used the term, “real talk.”\\n\\nGlad I got a chance to hear your voice today. I haven’t laughed out loud since this whole corona business went down. \\n\\nYou and Seth Meyers keep up the good work. So he thinks less of his peers because he gets to work in the \"big house\", and serve tea to his \"massa\", while the rest of us outside face reality. What an idiot uncle Tom just like Ben Carson. It compels me to consider changing my last name. Amber, you rock!  Keep dropping those truth bombs! @Thanks for another bad haircut, Mom! NoFirstName \\nImagine this idiot being the person anyone would listen to.\\n\\nGetting your news from the enemy and you don\\'t realize it. Well, nobody’s dumber than Ben Carson. Imagine him doing brain surgery? Holy cow. @A Willis I\\'m asthmatic too but I\\'m not listening to anything that Jerome Adams says when he knew exactly what he was doing for his racist boss. Michael Adams no!  He has an underlying condition himself, asthma. I don’t like who he married to. When Fauci was asked why people of color seem to have more serious cases, he said it’s because there is a higher prevalence of people with underlying health conditions that exacerbate the effects of the virus. And he added that that highlights the work we have to do in this country to fix those health differences. He also went on to say that this has NOTHING to due with DNA or that black people don\\'t take care of themselves (for the ignorant ones in the comments). It is due to decades of disparities in our health system and who has the front line jobs!! @Nina w You mean by calling you fat or something? Yep, he did and he did not drag or degrade us while bring awareness “I’m right and I don’t have time to argue with you. People are dying.” 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Amber is a national treasure. Fact She is a liar and racist @Sandy Barnes priceless😍 @Swampy you\\'re the best🤣 Omg she sure is a treasure! the weird problem is being black and then using those patronizing \"phrases\" - just say Grandmother and Grandfather, Abuela and Abuelo like everyone else and drop with all the other stuff, some of us don\\'t even use any of those names. \\nblack ppl also tend to hold less jobs in the office per capita, they work more with the public - and more likely to live with relatives who are older than them (due to being funneled into lower paying jobs - due to bias in hiring despite merit,  outright racial bias in salary - despite merit.  Less likely than white people to have the mobility to \"go quarantine in a 2nd home\" or to get medically  evaluated given poor medical coverage or no medical coverage. I have personally worked 2 jobs on multiple occasions in this country and have been completely without medical coverage - That is the life for many black people and many hispanic people as well. I mean money is so tight, I\\'ve seen communities of Hispanic hardworking folks riding their bikes home in the dark after a long day of work right beside me. NO woman should have to ride her bike home at 10 o clock at night, after working a full time job - but that\\'s another subject. I\\'m stunned that these arguments have to come from comedian( be it eloquently and truthfully) instead of the media. I do see reporters calling trump out respectfully in press conferences but this minute of fury is what we need right now. I don\\'t think Biden will step up. More moments of fury please amber. And please include possible courses if action. Our politicians are not the most imaginative or forward thinking.  Thanks again. \\n\\n\\nNow about that donut skit...  sounds funny I felt like so had to hold so much back when she spoke about friends working at this moment. My best friend works at a retail store filling online orders and an other works as a bus driver. I’m terrified for them. @Vinny Mac Really clown? Yet, you\\'re here watching? Bye bitchboy, I\\'m sure you go to hate channels often of your kind. Be gone, little boy. Terrified of what...Amber\\'s racism? Like and share, folks.  This is a pivotal monologue. The woman heading the NIH\\'s effort to find a vaccine for COVID-19 is a black woman - Dr Kizzmekia Corbett, PhD. She is 34 years old. 9000ck she also very anti black. I’ve seen her old tweets . Of course she has a new Twitter now. Spoken like a true national treasure - YAS to everything she said!! I really like the shut in version of late night. Seth gets to make obscure, self-indulgent jokes. Amber doesn’t have to worry about upsetting white sponsors. \"There have been reports of multiple AR-15 rifles being infected with Covid-19.\"  \\n\\n\\nThen you would stop hearing Republicans say the economy is worth the sacrifice. Way more effective than saying children are in danger. I like Amber when she isn\\'t doing her cutesy routine. This clip is some of her all-time best work. Keep being angry, Amber! Watch her Drunk History on the Little Rock Nine. Amber truly is one of the funniest women of our generation. This is her best?... it\\'s crap Gotta code-switch at work... I would point out that was more than a minute, but I don’t need Amber’s fury directed at me!  🤣 To quote my favorite Late Night comedienne:\\n\\n WHAT WHAT WHAT 🙌🏼 Surgeon  General, the stupid stuff that you\\'re spouting is what happens when you sell your soul to a walking Cheeto. When she opened with that stare and FOOL -- I lost it! I\\'m so glad I\\'m not the only one who found his statement irritating. It\\'s been bugging the heck out of me. @Mister Sinister A f*cking moron enters the chat. First systemic racism plays a large part in those numbers. People of Color are less likely to get the test and the same level of care than white people. Because of systemic racism, POC do not have access to the same level of health care and diets. Another factor.. stress and poverty, in case you didn\\'t understand my other way of pointing this out, will result in other factors that change health. I can go on, but if I have to point this out, you obviously don\\'t understand what I\\'ve already typed. @Joshua d\\'Estoville With those words he was talking down to them. Using overly familiar family names. It sounded like he was talking to children. It\\'s not trivial; it sounded like he thought he was superior or a higher social class because he worked in the white house.  It\\'s hard to explain in a lot of words. One word is patronizing. http://b.link/youtubemask\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best mask for front-liners & everyone, This Mask is completely different. See our page & video to learn more. In-stock PPE Made in America. @Bryon Miller I mean, people are definitely saying that these problems affect low income people overall, of any race. But the SG brought up race, which is why this discussion here is revolving around that topic. \\n\\n\\nAnd while you make an important point that \"poverty pays no mind to race,\" that doesn\\'t actually help us understand poverty in the real world. It\\'s just a fact that people of color are disproportionally living in poverty in this country, and we can\\'t just boil it down to \"oh, their decisions put them there, nothing else is to blame.\" Talking about poverty but ignoring race just doesn\\'t make sense if you\\'re trying to really understand the context surrounding it. @Alejandro K Were they blaming minorities or were they putting out information that says \"Hey we don\\'t know why, but minorities are more susceptible to this?\"  If all the above factors are the issue, why is it that people are not saying this is effecting people of low income, any race that falls into that catagory of poor is apparently going to have no other choice of food than what\\'s around them and apparently that\\'s nothing but junk food otherwise the poor would be able to make healthy choices since that would actually be an option for them to choose.  I don\\'t buy that, but if that\\'s the narrative, why isn\\'t it being pushed as a problem for people of low income?  Poverty pays no mind to race. I\\'m from Scotland, the only time I\\'ve ever heard the term \"Pop-pop\" was on Arrested Development,  as white as show as you\\'ll get! Seppington DeStamina me too \"Jerome, take your ass home\" \\nOh, now I get it Lizzo \"SAY WHAT\".....wtf is this minute of fury?!?...I was like... \"WHAT?!!\" There\\'s more clarity and context from Amber on this than most of the paid commentary in daily news.  Mainstream media tends to leave everyone in a fog about what\\'s going on.  And that surgeon general comes over like a total dumbass. Damn, Amber just layed a smackdown you just did a job on this guy!! @The321flyer \"She\" still has a mind capable of discerning bullshit. \"He\" is just another Trumpanzee hivemind automaton. Which are you ? Lua? Lua, you\\'re replying to a Seth Myers clip, not a Trevor Noah clip.\\n\\n--Dave, please make sure to use the correct list of talking points from the alt-right for the video you\\'re supposedly watching @Robert Taylor Is he busy treating Trump\\'s brain spurs ? Robert Taylor he’s too busy screwing up HUD. We still didn\\'t hear from the white house BRAIN SURGEON. When I heard Jerome Adams tell people of color to step up, I said \"WHAAAAAAT.\" TY Miss Amber. My favorite \"Jerome\" is Benton from The Time.  He has more soul than Generalissimo Emperor Trump\\'s own Jerome. \"Drunk at Home Amber\" is the absolute best Amber!!! I got a fever, and the only prescription is - more fury. Preach, Amber. Forget a minute, I\\'d listen to Amber roast this situation for an hour! Even Amber’s anger is adorable. I heard what she said. I didn’t like it. I liked hearing it. Make sense? Your hospital workers: cleaning staff, maintenance workers, unit clerks, reception and intake staff, CNAs, nurses and doctors, security,  Respiratory/ occupational and physical therapists, lab techs  etc are mostly people of color in major cities hospitals. They were expected to work even with lack of adequate protective equipment.  Hero shouldn\\'t equal expendable. Many have gotten sick and died from this virus. Many health organizations are in talks with unions about hazard pay and benefits for workers in this war. If you think our healthcare system was in trouble before wait until this is over.  Nurses and doctors are quitting because of the horrible experiences they\\'ve had.  Not to mention the PTSD and burnout.  There is no relief for them.  They\\'re gonna need so much more than praise. They\\'re  going to need real help. \"They\\'re my emergency contact!\" Oh my goodness I am too through! \\n\\nAnd yes what he did was a special kind of ignorant! Brilliant piece, despite the sadness of this intolerable situation. Kudos Seth & Amber. “J-Crew is my emergency contact.”\\n\\nLet’s just take a minute to soak in the absolute sheer brilliance of that joke. @Ken Smith Fair enough. Comments can be easily misconstrued. @Ray Watson \\nYou appear to have mistaken the meaning from my comment to R. Jay stewart.  He asked if something was racial.  Note that in my comment I compared the importance of the ignorance in question to a different ignorance.  Read that again and see if you don\\'t get an entirely different meaning that the one you took.  How important do you think knowing all Star Trek plot lines is? @Ken Smith Or, it could be that someone is from another country entirely. \\nYou sir, sound like a \"J-Crew type\", so geographically centrist, that the mre chance of someone not know about J-Crew was unthinkable. @R. Jay stewart \\nNo, I think not knowing J-Crew is a mere case of ignorance.  It may be a less important ignorance than not knowing the plot lines of all of Star Trek but it still is on the that spectrum.  BTW:  Star Trek did break a lot of ground on TV.  They had a black woman answering the phones. R. Jay stewart LOL! J-Crew is a clothing company. It’s typically worn by yuppie white people. \"Can you tell us when you fell in love with Amber, Kevin?\"\\n\"Sure can. It was when she began her rant against the surgeon general with \\' _Fool!_ \\' \" I was actually unaware of what the SG said, im curious if he says what he says in order to keep his position as SG? Listen Trump has shown that he wanted to fire Dr Fauci because of his recent wording during an interview about the nations response, and is only likely keeping his job because he walked it back, who\\'s to say Jerome isn\\'t under the same pressure, cause you know Trump would fire his black ass in a New York minute if he thought his house boy wasn\\'t towing the line the way he wants him too. Watching Amber always makes me happy, even when she\\'s talking about horrible things. I know this is a bit off topic, but the BEST jelly beans are the black ones @Thanks for another bad haircut, Mom! NoFirstName chocolate covered licorice is good though. The black ones are second best to red. The orange ones are the worst. Just like orange people. Agreed! Lo Ki THANK YOU! Don’t you licorice is supposed to be black? Cherry and chocolate flavored licorice. Naaaa. The fine and the furious. Give him hell, Amber!\\n\\n\"I\\'m right but I don\\'t have time to argue with you about it. People are dying.\" Pizza Hut is way better.  I question the judgement of people who prefer Dominoes. My 100 year old grandma will only eat Pizza Hut, & you know she\\'s like been around a long time. Probably tried them all. \\n\\nYes her taste buds are shot (just facts people), but I\\'m not about to argue with my 100 year old gram.\\n\\nSo yeah, Amber\\'s right, on this & soooo much more! @Tim Dungan-Levant \\n\\nThis.\\n\\nI posted that quote because I liked the quote, not as a vote for any particular Pizza. Whatever gets you through the day folks. Stay safe. @Julie Bladel They\\'re both mediocre corporate pizza. Please find good indie pizza shops and give them your business. THAT PART!!! 😂💀💗😏 I\\'ve been missing Amber! She\\'s spot-on as usual. Love Amber\\'s rants and have missed them.\\n\\nBut besides other obvious reasons, low Vitamin D levels are associated with weaker immune systems. And the darker your skin, the harder it is to get enough sun exposure to make Vitamin D when you live way above the equator in say, Minnesota... Even pale people get Vitamin D deficient in winter. More D means better ability to fight any virus.\\n\\nReally, the government should be handing out free bottles of Vitamin D3. At least 1000 IU per day is recommended to boost the immune system. More if your skin is darker or you don\\'t get much sun, maybe 2500 IU or  even 5000 IU. Dr. John Campbell\\'s YouTube channel has some videos on the research supporting this and how it relates to coronavirus.\\n\\nThe point that black and Hispanic Americans are especially likely to not be able to stay home because of their jobs is very true. This is also a problem for pale people in such jobs. \\n\\nIf we even just all wore masks when away from home, this would protect everybody because people who are infected but don\\'t have symptoms wouldn\\'t be ejecting infectious particles into the air every time they spoke. The particles can remain suspended in the air for a half hour to several hours. \\n\\nSo getting washable good cotton masks for everybody also has to be a priority. “A donut ate my family!”  Please do that. I want to triple thumbs up everything Amber says and does forever Her innocent look makes her bad ass personality stand out even more!!! \"You freakin\\' idiot\"  Love Amber Ruffin! I just love her! And she’s so spot on, too. I have never heard of Amber but I think that she is on point here. Amber is a badass. Thank heavens for warrior queens like Amber. Comedy is more that comedy these days, it\\'s the moral heartbeat or us all. When\\'s the next. \"Amber says what!?!\"? Even Atticus was able to bring himself to shoot a rabid dog when it was necessary We need Amber to do more Minutes of Fury.  I love when she\\'s funny, too. \"Jerome\"  look in the mirror and practice speaking to all American citizens. Amber is fabulous when she is furious. 💖Amber\\'s sense of Humor & Consciousness Can I give you two thumbs up?  Sooooooo appropriate ✔ I am surprised. I thought we were being impacted at a very low level until now, but yep, we should keep this on the lo, lo. Yea, we all thought that until black doctors and journalist started looking at statistics. He has lost his Jerome status . He is now a Donald . Dang AMBER IS FUNNY, smart, articulate, and gets right to the point. More Amber is better YouTube Lmao Jerome wilding, he soft that’s the only reason he has that position \"and they\\'re right.\" Sip. Tehehehe. (Girl crazy). As much as I love, \"Amber says What?\"  Amber\\'s minute of Fury was overdue.  You are a national treasure, you go gurl. Token speaking the party line: shameful... \"J CREW IS MY EMERGENCY CONTACT\" Why can I only like this once? Amber Ruffin is a sparkling jewel. More! @Alan Brown what comment did you not like?\\n\"I love her\" ?\\nOr \"I wish we could hit the like twice\"? @Alan Brown ? Dude. I was just agreeing with You! My thoughts exactly. \\nI wish we could . This is the first time that I\\'ve come across Amber..I\\'ve been missing out..She\\'s awesome.\\nWith you 100% here Amber.....You go get em girl...!!! He\\'s trying to replace Eric. We have to take responsibility? So we aren\\'t taking responsibility if we get Covid19? I call Bullsh..! As a nurse I see so much racism in healthcare! @My Prayer for Justice \\nI see you have no rebuttal argument so you opted to try insults.  That never impresses the lurkers. @Ken Smith Your ignorance is amazing and yet you spew it with such confidence! Please don\\'t change. As if you could🤭 Maybe responsibility for not all showing up and voting and thus letting that guy into office should be taken. He said “Do it for Big Mama”? WTF? “If you’re gonna hang out at this rink you need to buy something “\\n🤣🤣🤣 That was the line that is sticking with me. I loved Amber *before* this video. I dunno what I feel now but it\\'s intense. Needs More AMBER!!\\n\\nAnd less of that fool Jerome. _ncle Tom\\n\\n\\nYes, Pat, I\\'d like to buy a U, please. I want more of this Amber! Amber, as usual, is 100% correct. @MDMHypNoTiZe Tadas go on... No she is wrong Amber is always Amazing! Amber, that was brilliant! Seth, I vote for \"Amber\\'s One Minute of Fury\" being a regular segment on the show...at least until President Dufas\\'s term ends next January (hope springs eternal). I think she needs to find the material that works with it.  She also has the \"Amber says What\" bit. SO glad that was longer than a minute!  Amber, you’re wonderful  :D My only response was \"perfect\"... She\\'s on point on everything Would love to see Amber\\'s 30 Minutes of Fury, or Amber\\'s 30 Minutes of whatever she wants cause I will watch it either way. Amber\\'s minute needs to be Amber\\'s hour for the ignorant people that desperately need an educational suppository. @Mechanical David 😆😆 the commenter did no such thing. @Mechanical David 🙄What now? @TCt83067695 Please stop asking people of color to do ALL the jobs My hateful evangelical cousin just lost her abusive daughter-diddling creep of a father to C-19 a few weeks ago. He was in a nursing home in Houston. It was a couple of weeks after Mardi Gras. She posted the last photo taken just before he got sick, he was sitting in a wheelchair proudly wearing his maga hat, with 4 of his adult grandchildren hugging him. I looked at those G-kids\\' FaceBk pages, and I\\'m sure y\\'all will be SHOCKED to know that two of them had been to Mardi Gras.\\r\\nCan you spell \"Karma\"?\\r\\nThis is the same cousin who told me \"Too bad your father is being tortured RIGHT NOW for eternity in HELL\" right after his funeral. My Dad was a wonderful man, everyone loved him, hundreds came to the funeral and chairs and loudspeakers were set out for the overflow. \\r\\nHe was a brilliant scientist who pointed out things to her in the bible that contradict itself (because he actually read it), and that was her reason for saying he was in hell. \"Questioning God is the only unforgivable sin!\" she said.\\r\\nI told her that if good people like him go to hell, then I know he\\'ll save me a seat. REAL hell would be being trapped for eternity with hateful bitches like her!\\nShe\\'s still going to church and refuses to wear a mask because it will mess up her hair and makeup. \\nHer hatefulness is only matched by her stupidity. she could carry a show.  i\\'d miss her from here, but she could totally carry a Samantha bee type show. And speaking of income inequality, all the big shot hosts like Seth, Colbert, and others took off running for the hills (their second homes in Connecticut, Long Island, NJ, etc..) while people like Amber and probably the rest of the staff have to endure the pandemic in their minuscule NYC apartments.  So, talk about that. Amber started that moment of Fury like the grandmother from Blackish. I love it! Crises always exacerbate social inequalities in a society.  It is infuriating how, even in a time of crisis, our executive \"leadership\" seems hell-bent on playing the blame game. Damn it. Amber is fantastic. She needs to have more spots on this show. I recently watched Don Lemon, he had a guest , they were discussing trumps name added to the cheque’s  due to come out soon. He seemed confused as to why the IRS, the Finance dept would allow trumps name on these cheque’s .   They are bound to be non-partisan. Here is the simple truth of it.  Trump wants his name on the cheque’s so ppl will look at it and think , what a great guy, giving me free money.  I will vote for him.  “basically an implied bribe.”   Sadly some ppl’s thought process is so basic , so uninformed , for lack of a better word “ ignorant” that they will fall for this.   However by including trumps name on the check it is another violation of the HATCH ACT.   It is illegal to campaign on any govt property, said or implied.   A govt cheque is govt property.   The cheque’s will be delayed bc of the changes to add the name. Ima Farmer: Trump thinks his name on those checks will give him a tax writeoff, Thank You! God please Save OUR Democracy! @jwoolman5 I\\'m fortunate enough that I won\\'t be receiving a check. If I did, I\\'d definitely write something  in after his signature before cashing it.  Something like \"IQ#45\". Melanie Lee - Trump wanted to actually sign the checks. The poor guy had to settle for being on the memo line because it turns out he isn\\'t authorized to sign such checks. His total authority seems to be chipped away at even in this...\\n\\nTrump doesn\\'t realize how many people have direct deposit these days and will never see his name. @Deadbeat Donny what part are you referring to? one of the best voices for bring important points across, but damn her jokes are also good. May I refer you to Lizzo\\'s classic song, \"Jerome\"? ',\n",

I don\\'t feel insecure when I walk in a room Right on cause I carry. @Mrquick168 That’s very true. @MrStrongBro just because u think u can protect yourself without training doesnt mean u can... thats delusional confidence, a mixed martial artist even knows more drawbacks of fighting than the average person since theyre more exposed to it Sometimes I feel as if martial arts is for the insecure. If you feel confident and have never trained or fought in your life, great! But for those who are insecure in their abilities to protect themselves, martial arts help build that confidence. Thats because you\\'ve never been knocked out before For someone that \"never wants to be in a fight in public\" you sure threaten violence on a lot of people. @John you literally made it sound like he had a shot at defending himself from a hitman he doesnt @Luke Bassilious easy to say until you have someone punching the seat you are in. Doesn\\'t feel good Examples please Tarang Shrivastava FACTS! @vuzganje I feel like you are digging too deep into it. When people start yelling there is no road to a real solution. All it takes is the wrong trained hothead to fuck a guy up who is yelling and thinking it won\\'t lead to anything. Firas is just skipping to the conclusion, are we gonna fight, or are we not. If we aren\\'t then quit yelling without backing your shit up. Succinct, effective, and simple **Firas ordering 5 hot wings**\\n**Restaurant gives him 6**\\n**Also Firas** : You guys wanna go?

He\\'s a killer. @Dayvon Patterson I\\'m from England and got macheted clean in my head. Thank God above for the dull blade, my skull stopped it with a minor scratch. Still get headaches right on my scar every now and then, and if people start fights with me I just switch and go crazy. I know how that situation could end and I won\\'t let that happen again, this guy hasn\\'t got a clue about real violence at all. @Mugo All good to you friend. Europe is kinda similar but vastly less violent then USA.Firas lives in Canada so he can probably spook people off in more than 70% of the time.In America you have basically unlimited supply of firearms combined with very low iq of some individuals , those types of altercation can be fatal even to the best of the best.That was the other guys point. @AR GW im an amateur fighter (not lately) with a few years experience. This lesson to me was way more important than the self defense. Being able and confident can lead to overlooking this reality this firas guy reminds  me of \"\\' Adam sandler\\'s  character  in  You dont mess with the Zohan\"movie \" -\"You dont want this\", i kill many men ok I kill you, lets go. Not really true, most people will not expect a physical conflict going into a room with people, even if its a room full of strangers. Only people who have been exposed to physical violence will be worried about it. Ehhh, I dunno, seems like every week an MMA fighter is fighting someone outside. Mike Perry just knocked out an old fat dude, Brian Ortega slapped a Kpop rapper lol. Me n my homesters *SMACKED* some little 5 year old silly for calling us poopy heads It\\'s a cold world.

U got issues \"So this old man asks me if I could help him put his groceries in his car and I\\'m like \\'Yo, this old dude\\'s never been knocked out before.\\'\" I\\'m retired military and I had a friend that would say about bullies, \"They have never had a good old fashioned ass whipping.\" My dad was a Vietnam Veteran and a Chickasaw Indian. He gave me good old fashioned ass whippings and told me never to go looking for a trouble because you will find it and may regret it forever. He was shot in a fight after he came home from Vietnam and languished in intensive care for 21 days. There\\'s some really dangerous people out there and the best thing you can do for yourself and those that love you is to keep your mouth shut and practice humility. @okay dude Dead meme. ok boomer 😂 Frederick Lawton It’s about picking the best options, aiming to avoid the bad while consuming and giving out the good. It ain’t a perfect science that’s why life isn’t easy😂 Def agree with you keep to yourself but still be ready to defend yourself if your force too This guy seams very insecure. It is always suspect when a guy has to tell stories about how tough and skilled he is. They are literally on a mma podcast just lol. Use your critical thinking skills. God knows his intentions Talking about lack of respect, I would never lean my airplane seat back without at least checking behind me. I am not asking for permission, but maybe a mother is breastfeeding back there, fer crissakes. @Antonio Viega Naranjo I always check taxis before getting in for the same reason! But it is just an example. I cannot imagine reclining my seat without looking to see what is behind me, in the same way that I do not let doors go without checking, or walking without looking in front. It is just common courtesy. there are breastfeeding mothers all over the place and in the least suspected places. In fact, I always double check when leaving home in case there´s a breastfeeding mother laying back in my front door, one never knows 99% of the people who picked a fight with me regretted it immediately!!! The other 1% kicked the living shit out of me  😬 How are you getting in so many fights? 0:07 \"Imagine you have no morshorsh training...\" @Javajavajava LOL! I wish he said mixed martial arts. Mish morshorsh ahahhaha underrated comment! regular people don\\'t feel intimidated when they walk into a room of people \"Last thing I wanna do in public is fight\" 20 seconds later... \"I open my car door and say \"You wanna go?\\'\" Lmao @Chuck \\nHe\\'s not getting challenged, he\\'s a bully looking for an excuse to show off. @Chuck That\\'s how you get into a fight though. By responding to a challenge, clearly fighting is not the last thing he want\\'s to do. @Chris Watkins bullys are intimidating guys who gets joy out of watching others cowering in fear by physically or emotionally imposing themselves @Chris Watkins you do realize that there is always two sides to every coin? The way Firas explains it from his first person perspective, he does sound righteous and noble...just like everyone who tells a story.  It\\'s very rare that someone would describe any type of altercation as their own fault.  \\nWith that being said, it\\'s very likely Firas was being the bully who fears no repercussions from a physical threat perspective... just because he can!!!  That\\'s why he would challenge an old man to a fist fight, mid-flight on an airplane!!!   Who even does that or even suggests that??  Think about it...its a bully move thats actually the dumbest thing a person can possibly do on a passenger airplane!!! A baby in a stroller threw his baby bottle at me. Clearly, he’s never been knocked out before. \"Most people have zero idea how vulnerable they are\" Violence is the dumb guy\\'s way of solving issues with people.\\n\\nDon\\'t be dumb. Don\\'t end up in jail.\\n\\nSmart people keep their cool and move on. Dumb people will always exist, regardless of society\\'s rules. Don\\'t escalate. Motivate. Only true depending on the situation. sounds like someone has never been knocked out Kai Leroy lol u watch lookism videos😭😭😭 You sound like a coward lol Only smart ones feel that insecurity. And have that kind of awareness.\\n\\n Most people either think their tough guys. Or are just to stupid to even realize shit could go down. They think they\\'re living in this safety bubble. Where they can do and say whatever they want without repercussions. And if anything happens the cops will come break it up and arrest you. Because obviously your the \"bad guy\". Umm...I just generally don\\'t go out expecting fighting to happen I guess So true. Most people think too highly of their physicality/ intelligence without any actual Demonstrable evidence of that ability 😆 I’ve seen lots of bullying done by people with training. Lots. @aabdo aabuharbeed prime example of a hollywood story @faggy maxwell lmao like cops have any training 😂 @faggy maxwell more like BLM and AntiFa aholes. Not trained by this guy 😉 @faggy maxwell You mean when they do their job against resisting criminals? That\\'s not bullying. That justice. Unless you are a criminal. Perspective i guess. If you think he is quick to initiate a fight it’s actually the opposite. Him as a fighter knows these everyday so called tough guys are not willing to take it there if offered the opportunity. He just wants them to realize that themselves. \"In your car and safe\" then you dont know what true violence is buddy. Facts Ik what u mean Something just comes off really fake about Firas. \"I would never talk like that to somebody\" proceeds to talk about how he talked to someone just like that. \\u200b@Kenny Venegas says a scrawny looking crackhead who looks like he hasn\\'t spent a day training. Some dipshit should learn to stop being a dipshit, not that others should learn to avoid them and let them fucking harass other people. Not unprovoked. Difference too is he can back it up. JFrost nigga what you know about US gang culture niggas fight all the time and most people don’t retaliate because you don’t want escalate something with guns because homies look for revenge Firas is a top mma trainer, check his bg dummy The key here is not the world “violence”, but “aggression”. There is no need to get aggressive over every nuisance, because aggression may cause a backlash, which in turn can make a minor thing escalate. So first just _ask_ if something bothers you, and stay respectful. Basically, treat other people like you would want them to treat you. But if somebody threatens you over nothing, you can safely assume this guy (yes, guy, women usually don\\'t do things like that) knows nothing about violence, so you can really go for it. Joe going on like there isn\\'t bullies in martial arts @JP M Definitely agree with this. There can always potentially be ass hats in martial arts classes. People are delusional if they think otherwise. @iorekby the positive thing about MMA is discipline and good people learning it and how to defend themselves, but is very very bad when bad people learn it, in fact it makes them worse because when a insecure bully who can\\'t fight gets confronted he stops being a bully, but when bully get access to MMA, you aint stopping him, what Rogan says is not true. I don\\'t buy the bullshit Rogan says about bullies in MMA because is totally wrong and I have seen it, the famous tall bully in my school was knocking untrained midgets out with head kicks LMAO, and you can\\'t change someone like that. Maybe in the 10th planet and champagne gyms where Joe trains is different... But in the hood is very different. There is always a bully in certain gyms, you see it really fast in training. Since MMA is popular bullies use it so they actually can\\'t be confronted like you can with an untrained bully, what Joe says about \"not using your power\" is just not true if you are already a bully In fact there is too much in a lot of gyms, and they are not getting kicked out when they act like they do in training @micnpark this Someone never seen the Karate Kid He\\'s like last thing I wanna do in public is getting into a fight.\\nNext sentence, dude humps at me in his car\\n\\'\\'You wanna go?\\'\\' haha Joe \"it\\'s illegal to drop out of high school now?\" Rogan a fight in a gym is different then a street fight. In a street fight theres no referee to pull the other guy off you when you get knocked out. What?!?! You get pulled off in a gym? Wow I was friends with a kid in high school that was at national level in tae kwon do and he was an asshole and a bully. I\\'m sorry, but that point is just wishful thinking. Damien Holland true The worst bullies in my high school had martial arts training. To be fair I don\\'t know the statistics and maybe people who train are less likely to bully. The quiet ones, the humble, the respectful are most often the ones to truly be cognizant of. Those are the truly dangerous. naaaaa a couple of my peers growing up were some wanna be tough guys. one of them learned some mma and turned into a wanna be alpha douche lol but I noticed he only picked on people who he thought didn’t know how to fight lol Nathan Smith also started talking down punking the dudes in the group who couldn’t fight Nathan Smith i checked one of my friends who Joined Muay Thai. I started boxing in high school and mma after but stayed active in both so I was well rounded. I had to beat his ass with the gloves cause he started acting like he was the pack leader or something and started throwing the word bitch around too much Why didn\\'t you put him in his place is the question>? Since he\\'s a wanna be Well if learning martial arts was mandatory for everyone, it would sorta lose its point Then it would come down to belt distinction In Canada, you can leave school legally at 16 years of age ( or younger, in some provinces, with the permission of a parent or guardian) So, if you are 16 years of age in High School ( or grade school, or kindergarten....) you\\'re free to go. I\\'ve met bullies that learned how to fight. It did not make them more respectful lol. Some people are just mean @A Confused Shoe in peace brother,\\n\\nyou are more dangerous than a bully learning how to fight,\\n\\nsomeone who has been picked on and then becomes a skilled fighter..\\nthat guy is more of a problem than a bully @Holden Morrison You\\'d be surprised at how weak some people\\'s chins are. But I get what you\\'re saying and no you\\'re not wrong to be infuriated about it to this day. I think it makes you a good person in that specific respect. @Slow motion with the potion tryna get to the ocean But he grew up in Newark which is still one of the worst cities in New Jersey??? @Joshua Stanford Yea but the amount of people he\\'s gonna fuck up before he gets defeated? God only knows and ok he gets beat up once you\\'re acting like he\\'s gonna change his ways. >\"These guys clearly have never been in a fight.\"\\n\\nI mean, I guess I\\'m just an idiot, because I\\'ve been busted up in fights more than anyone else I know, and I still get hostile with people. Firas: The last thing I wanna do in public is get in a fight\\n\\nAlso Firas: \"gets out the car\" \\nYou wanna go? if you really watch this guy\\'s demeanor and  his way of speaking,  you realize that he is looking for someone to provoke him He is not honest with himself like most of the guys who take fighting classes Joe keeps saying that through fighting you get more disciplined and less violent but i don t buy that Against whom are you fighting in your mind when you take training classes? Against another human being isn it? So you re already starting a conflict in your mind You do that every day and you become it Then you re looking for reasons to act out what you re actually train for **Gonna his horn** “shut your mouth” They are describing half the people in YouTube comment sections. you wana go? Foul Gerbil fuck you bitch. Wanna go? My dad could beat up your dad !! I’m bored, you guys wanna have a go Hahah 100% I saw so many comments here by idiots questioning a world class mixed martial arts trainer. I bet you they haven\\'t been in a fight before!! If your jujitsu keeps you from feeling insecure then you are delusional. Iv\\'e never trained in martial arts and I never walk into a room full of people and feel insecure,why should I ? @Swaggius Maximus I have fought many,many times bro,so WTF are you talking about fucktard ? You grandma fucking simpleton ! BIG D lol bro once you get in a actual fight and society can’t protect you’ll understand. Until then just feel safe and keep postering “aggressively” @David Faulds \"I use plenty of aggression\" 😂😂 Clearly you havent been knocked out @lifeIS FuckedUPed I did some boxing training as a youth and use plenty of aggression when someone starts something on me,it seems to work. 3:person with no skill\\n2:person with lifetime mma training (could be the baddest mf on the planet)\\n1: a person with a couple of weeks of firearm training and carry’s all the time. BushidoKi and in Wisconsin the protection of the people aka the police can shoot someone in the back 8 times in front of their little kids for getting into there car BushidoKi in my state you can @BushidoKi yes you can ok but you cant just shoot somone for throwing hands at you @Jacob Herrin agreed, also i bet DC on steroids beats JJ on steroids lol *Laughs in Connor beating an old man for not drinking his whiskey* I used to think I was a badass in high school until I met the wrong person. Knocked out for 3 mins in the boys bathroom. Been humble and respectful ever since. @yeahSOwhat yea ok buddy @David Hardy yea ok buddy @James Ross - I feel like everyone missed this great joke. You guys make me cringe. I got beaten twice in my life. Once in a kickboxing fight I never wanted in on. Something I\\'ll never forgive Kru dickhead for and once by some fat nerd 3 years above me. Not badly. Just a few whacks and pushed over but although I probably wasn\\'t completely blameless it started over something a freind said. I still know who he is and although it was 10 years ago now I will never forgive him either. I certainly don\\'t feel \"humbled\". Given the chance to get away with it I will seriously hurt him and it will not be comparable to the few shots he gave me. I\\'m a lot bigger than him now and I am trained.\\n\\nHonestly it surprises me how you guys can be okay with it. The fat older kid will meet me alone one day. I sure hope so at least and there is one other kid who I truly hate with a passion because him, his dad, brother and friend cornered me when I was 10. I was terrified for ages afterwards and I can truly say that I would love to watch the scumbag die.\\n\\nI see no pride in being violently forced into submission. It\\'s humiliating and unforgivable. All you dudes laughing, 99% of you are exactly what Firas is talking about. Fact is 99% of guys aren\\'t fighters (EVEN if you\\'ve trained), and you shouldn\\'t think your tough. Your just waiting to get taught a lesson. push someone to their limit and they’ll throw on clown makeup Idk, if I’m fighting I’m gonna use a bat or some sort of weapon. when i was doing Muay Thai i had days where i thought \"man i oughta get an amateur fight\" and then i had days where i thought \"man i better never mouth off to anyone, i suck at this\"  it\\'s really good to train because you know you have good days and bad days.  And those bad days can be really humbling.  I used to spar with this (old to me at the time) 50 year old cyclist.  He looked like a nerd but the guy was so accurate and sharp with his punches that even though i was bigger and stronger he could pick me apart.  You just never know by looking at someone what they can do. I\\'ve noticed fighters on this podcast always talk about how important it is to be able to fight even though they don\\'t want to but they always talk about many times they\\'ve been in fights or close it... I don\\'t think that happens so much to people who aren\\'t obsessed with fighting This respect for all thing will definitely happen when you have sparred e few times and know what it is but people in the gym who have trained for maybe 2 to 3 months usually think they’re really good. They are more confident in their abilities and that causes them to get into fights even more often. So i think you’re theory kicks in later in a fighters (carreer) It’s not illegal to drop out of high school in Canada, this whole clip all this dude did was talk about how he was in a position to crush someone... such as shit conservation No bully\\'s in the gym?\\n\\nHave they ever met Rampage Jackson? He speaks about the dangers of violence but tells stories of him turning things physical. @Antonio RL Why would i think it\\'s okay to disrespect random people? I believe in treating everyone with respect. I also would never \"unleash my road rage\" on anyone because it\\'s obviously a retarded thing to do that brings nothing good. It\\'s dramatic to jump straight to violence when people disrespect you and it\\'s counterproductive. Let me be clear violence has its time and place but if a stranger says something rude i\\'m not gonna dish out god\\'s divine punishment on him i\\'d say fuck you and ignore him, if something escalates from there go for it and fuck em up. I am not taking the side against any violence I\\'m pointing out that the guy preached about avoiding violence and then talked about how easily he wields the threat. It seems hypocritical for this guy to portray himself as above violence and those who play with it and then tell stories of how easily he chooses to threaten violent retaliation against people who were rude. @Liam P so you think its okay to disrespect people you have no clue about that you randomly meet on the street? If thats the code you run by one day or another you might encounter the wrong dude to unleash your \"road rage\" on. What he was trying to say is that people do more than just disrespect him, they talk over him like they are his parents and thats not okay. At that point you are asking to get decked in the chin for something as stupid as a laptop or a road rage incident. @C J But he chose to escalate a non-violent situation with the threat of violence. He said himself that \"people don\\'t know the danger of fights\" and that they shouldn\\'t be so willing to start them but then tells a story about him making things physical in a dispute that would end better for everybody if he just kept driving away. He just doesn\\'t think other people should start fights, when its him and his actions he seems to justify it through the lens of teacher showing this fool that he can\\'t disrespect someone. This guy is good at fighting and disciplined but his anger and indignation betrays his professed opinion. @Antonio RL he didn\\'t have to give any ass-whooping, he chose to escalate a road rage situation because a man yelled at him due to ignorance. If you think that starting a fight with anyone that disrespects you is the right course of action you\\'ll get in a lot more fights than someone who decides it\\'s not worth their time. Clearly his pride prompted him  to threaten the man not some fatherly discipline he wants to impose on random angry drivers. People can be disrespectful if they want, being physically hurt usually crosses a line. The ability of this guy to kick someones ass is no divine power he just trained a lot. Whether or not violence like that is good he said himself that he thinks its important to avoid it but went on to say how he gladly invites it when disrespected. How he didn’t throw any punches When Firas was talking about the car incident... in america people will probably just pull out their gun. It’s America, where lazy, egotistical, arrogant people who aren’t satisfied with their privileged lives go out their way to cause trouble to feel content with themselves, no fighting skills needed when you can just pull a trigger. \"Walking in the store and some kid coughed near me no joke, this is clearly someone who has never been beaten in their life before.\" Not all bullies are insecure. A lot are just sadistic. It\\'s the same question as with guns.\\nIt\\'s about how responsible the community is. Yankees shoot each other up. The Swiss don\\'t. @mamuburaa Illuminati are called globalists now. @Jason Eaton I\\'m sure the top bankers are very powerful there, but Illuminati? That\\'s where you\\'re veering into crazy territory.\\nIlluminati or other lodges aren\\'t necessarily more powerful than any oligarchic society that openly plan their corruption between themselves. mamuburaa it’s heavy what lm saying, but it’s the truth. I’ve seen foreigners come here and be completely clueless of what’s around them. Switzerland isn’t a public place, it’s private, they control everyone. @Jason Eaton Lol what? mamuburaa the Swiss are COMPLETELY MIND-CONTROLLED by the Illuminati. The French and American revolutions didn’t reach us. They decapitated rebels. You think you can fight until Mr Concealed Carry makes his presence known. but why lol they can bring me down and get shot down too. Lol Submission Grappling That’s self defense. I don’t fight random people. Lol this ain’t Boxing. You attack me, you might look down my barrel. @Skeptical Slim \"me, also a European, who conceals a knife on him everyday\" 👏👏👏 @DIVI FILIVS Hand to hand skills are way more useful, I\\'ve used boxing/martial arts to defend myself before and it\\'s also given me confidence to step up to bullies and people fucking with me or my friends. On a plane, traveling, jail, etc. You\\'re not going to have gun anyways so then what? Cry and tell them I\\'m normally tough with my gun? @Damiaan Excuses for being a pussy not acceptable, I\\'ve had 1 on 1 fights its not that big of a deal This guy is way too impressed with his street fighting, wanna-be tough guy persona....... The “reality” is that this dude has the wrong idea. What happens when you threaten the wrong person, they’re packing and they have nothing to lose? Are you going to punch a bullet away? Confrontation should always be avoided if possible. The only real reason to fight is self defense. andreas stubbendorff this is not how the adult world works bro. I’ve been training mma for 10 years I’m sure as shit not going around “teaching people lessons.” That’s an arrogant fucking thing to assume. Plus I don’t want to go to jail. Plus I don’t want to accidentally kill someone. Plus I don’t want to be killed myself.\\n\\nYou know what I did last time I got into a little road rage thing? Dude mouthed off to me cause I cut him off a little (he was making a right I made a left in the other direction.)\\n\\nAnyway I apologized to the person. He nodded, said “all good”, and drove off. \\n\\nDude was ready to fucking go and he would have been very surprised to find himself on his back. Not worth it man. Not worth it at all. Let some other nutjob “teach him a lesson” I have fucking shit to do. Sometimes a good beating can be seen as a necessary lesson Some dude hits the back of Jacko Willink\\'s chair....\\n\\nThe chair apologizes on his behalf * Jocko Martial arts are the single best deterrent to violence that exists.\\n\\n\\nEspecially in a post apocalyptic world when all the bullets run out..... in the first week Mma training or growing up on the streets? \\n\\nJorge masvidal: yes. @Nid Styles No but Jason Reyes might like that @sonny kalua do you need a date? I can send some young handsome men your way :^) Jason Reyes or have both Jason Reyes are you mad? \\nYour bitch ass: Very @adrian28576 the hood? or poverty? fighting comes with playing at that age This guy should let his dark side blossom and become a dictator. His entire character just screams angry middle eastener. If someone \"crushes\" my laptop I\\'d be mad too! \"One day you\\'re the hunted, the other you\\'re the hunter.\"\\nImma put that on my wall And you can interpret it in more than one way. \"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth\" -  Mike Tyson @Benja Franklin mike tyson would be the absolute shit out of Firas . . . SPENCE it is a funny quote though @Kaiser Of Nothing Looks like you have a plan Jonathan-Paul Marois every boxer has a plan until they eat a double leg Correction:\\n\"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the faith\" - Mike Tyson “Well here if he did that, we’d kick his face in” This guy is pretty insecure. You can tell by the need to pull these 2 situations up where he almost fight some guy but he didn\\'t because he said he was the smarter guy. He needs the confirmation from Joe what a badass he truly is. Of course he doesn\\'t wanna get into a fight but if someone starts talking to him like they made him he has the right to scare them because you have to respect yourself. And besides everyone can have a bad day. People in the comment section be like \"he says he doesn\\'t wanna fight but said \"you wanna go?\"\". Makes no sense to not call someone\\'s bluff especially if they\\'re like \"you this and that I\\'m gonna kick your ass bla bla bla\". Of course you have the right to let him try he never said he would hurt the guy but on the other hand if he does this to someone and they know he knows how to fight then yea it\\'s quite dangerous and stupid but sometimes you just gotta be like \"ok you think you can kick my ass well put your money where your mouth is\". Also, how many actual fights has Rogan been in One time I was on a airplane on my laptop and the guy in front of me pushed his chair back and almost broke my laptop I was like wow man and then started telling me off @Kani G congratulations your the winner lol @Craig i know I\\'m late but desert storm had less than 400 American deaths, not even all through combat, the desert was almost more dangerous then the Iraqis. That were so tired of fighting some of them literally surrendered to journalists. Most soldiers didn\\'t see combat in that war. Guys.. He was trying to play the guy that Firas was talking about. Talk about Hook line and sinker. da newb don’t put your lab top there. All I know is that I’m leaning back in my seat regardless of who’s behind me. If they have a problem with it they can switch me seats. @CK he doesnt have the right to crush someones laptop tho I agree about drivers tho. There\\'s so many assholes driving around honking at everybody, thinking they are hot shit, because they feel safe in their car. I had similiar situation, with a guy who ALMOST bumped into my car(from his fault). He stopped pulled down the window and started shouting, like he was in the right, so I told him to come out of the car. He did come out, so I stepped out too, but turns out I was more than head taller than the guy and he was pretty skinny too, when he realized that he imidiatly toned down his voice, started speaking politely and walked back into his car and drove away. Now I\\'m not writing about this to show off, just giving you all an idea, what kind of people are the ones angirly honking, while in the car. @Raphaël Paillot I mean it does make sense. Society needs the police after all. Somehow, some people don\\'t understand good manners until they fear getting punched 😂 this guy is disputing what HE says in the first minute - hard to believe anything he says! Some guy named Paulie - Heyyy you just cut me off \\nGuy - this guy clearly hasn\\'t been knocked out before\\nSome guy named Paulie - shoots guy in the head I always tell my wife, when you\\'re driving and you get mad at someone else on the road, don\\'t get any angrier or say anything that you wouldn\\'t say directly to their face.  Road rage exists because insecure people get tough in the safety of their own little world. Well I\\'ve been lifting for 6 years now. I do feel confident. But he\\'s missing one thing. Do you think steve jobs or bill gates felt insecure when they walked into a room? The thing is.. confedence comes from being good at something and taking pride in it. Doesn\\'t have to be physical @Mobri Oh shit I forgot to say, I appreciate you sharing yours and that you listened haha. @Mobri No prob, hope you build up that confidence in what you do and wherever you are....if you haven\\'t yet ofcourse. @boxing elf is That\\'s all extremely fair. I really appreciate you sharing those thoughts. You really think those men wouldnt be insecure in a room full of men, just by themselves? @Mobri Something you should consider is, a reason why a lot of bullies act the way they do is cause they\\'re insecure about everything except their physical abilities and are intimidated by those smarter than they are or those who can excell at different tasks that don\\'t require that much of muscle and there are a lot of those, so they bully in order to reclaim their pride or social standing etc... I was waiting to load wood from a cut down tree someone posted on FB, when the Fat neighbor came out of the house like a tuff guy telling me not to be near his drive way. Apologized to him with a smirk, 2nd load, he left and I left a bunch of stumps blocking the front of his driveway, tuff guy can get a work out now. 🤣 My change was 10 dollars but the cashier gave my a 20. I said “You wanna go” and she looked away. Obviously she’s never been in a fight before. Oldest story known to mankind.\\nThere tombstones should read\\n\"He wasnt ready\" Generally the more you feel it in your head, the less you will feel it on the outside. I’m guessing that Connor Mcgreggor is an anomaly then, martial arts didn’t stop him from punching an old dude 😅 That old dude had it coming @Michael Star well,, i seen what the video showed, but not what came before or what prompted the assault or the context of the situation or what their history to each other might have been. Don\\'t refuse to take a shot with a Irish man!  Out your fuckung mind lol as the video was saying mnotho khuluse These McGregor fans are sick trying to justify a young fighter trained at elite level punching a much older “civilian” who wasn’t even postured up or any type of threat to him whatsoever, over what we all know was him turning down a shot of piss. Cocaine is one helluva drug. ',\n",

And I\\'m on my journey in becoming a chemist soo Im actually that nerd that watches it for no reason \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd takes notes too i- why do i feel so seen I like how instead of watching the video I’m scrolling through all the chemistry jokes in the comments Pollen: _jiggled randomly_\\n_RANDOMLY_\\nEinstein: *GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE* Lmao this lol first word\\'s \"please dont runaway screaming\"😂😂😂😂 @glance shot word\\'s not word you look vary dumb for trying to act smart but ok I believe that is a sentence not a word but ok I almost did the same thing at first but I setteled down. i all ready ran away. i thoght it was a how to make chucky I felt that Why did the science teacher and the biology teacher break up?

Do you know why you can\\'t trust atoms?\\nBecause they make up everything WHen u ask google (like say ok google) for a joke this is one of the more likely ones to be heard Ok that ones pretty good Haha good one now these are the comments I like to see punny Hank: protons, neutrons, and electrons make up everything\\n\\nMe: *laughs in quarks and particle physics* who else is having to watch this because of the coronavirus😤🤔 Knowing I had a chemistry class next year I decided to do something productive during quarantine. Not my school but by mom MEH Anthony Solis assignment This is honestly better than being in school. My 10 year old son Jay wants to be a Chemist so I\\'m getting my study on so I can have a clue to what he\\'s gonna be talking about😆\\n\\n@keithdevore Let him watch this 00:05 \"give me five minutes\"... ...talks for more than 10 minutes In high school, I was very excited to take a Chemistry class. However, a few months in, it became my least favorite class. A bunch of the more rowdy students hijacked the class and often distracted the teacher - I learnt nothing, and it showed on tests. I eventually came to dislike Chemistry, treating it as a dirty word. But now, only one video in, a decent teacher has reminded me exactly why I was so excited in the first place.\\n\\nThank you, Hank! Yeah I was excited about Psychology... then I met the teacher and the just... disorganization about it and I\\'m not liking the class so much. Exactly Im having a similar experience right now! I was super excited to take chemistry bc my parents made it seem really interesting but my teacher is so SHITTY. he\\'s at least 80 and is hard of hearing. I hate the class because of him but hank is here reminding me why it\\'s fascinating I thought chemistry was mixing to vials and accsedently making a bomb but nope that never happened that teacher distraction happens in my class too. this guy is everywhere he is smart... and the way he teaches is amazing... 2:23\\n\"...that the \\'matter\\' was truly settled.\" \\nI SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, HANK.\\nVERY CLEVER. Wooosh but ok to those binge watching for the AP chem exam tomorrow.... i wish us all good luck \"chemistry is not torture\"\\n\\n4 months into chemistry, I beg to differ xD Chemistry is not torture, bad teachers are torture. Nahh imma have to differ your differ-ance there Same I\\'m interested in it dunno if chemistry interested in me or not why dont you like it so far lol yeeess!!! Hank: there is nothing  can let you understand the world better than chemistry\\nPhysics: hold my beer Well, physics is great for undestanding nature and the Universe, but chemestry will help you understand the World around you better, every single thing arround you has atoms and molecles and propieties and you can only undestand them with chemestry. Physics is more general, and it\\'s better if you want to find a \"Theory of Everything\". But chemestry is the tool for studying more deeply specific things down to the individual molecules 2:06 Atoms are just a theory... a *_science theory._*\\n\\nThanks for watching. @Lucarrie +MatPat I want a stable relationship like the the number of protons in a nucleus \"Stuff is made from atoms\"\\n\\n- Hank Green, 2012\\n\\nVVery scientific, Hank. Why is it that someone who isn\\'t actually a teacher is a better teacher than real teachers? @caween 🥔 dont knownif you realize this or not, bub, but teachers dont get a very hefty paycheck, i dont think theyre mostly in it for the money. No Students in his class to disrupt answer he is a teacher, just not your traditional kind @caween 🥔, be assured that he and his brother are getting a paycheck, but I\\'m sure they\\'re interested in the subjects too. Because not working directly with children hasn’t sucked out his soul I’m 12 and honestly I think chemistry is REALLY interesting. I know about nitric acid, potassium nitrate, capsaicin, and some more but I don’t know the basics of chemistry so that’s why I’m here 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ Me: Sees 8 hours of video material about chemistry, most of which I might have to watch at least several times to fully grasp what\\'s going on\\nHank: Please do not run away screaming! Is it bad bad that I\\'ve seen this series like 6 times already and have not gotten bored of it yet. pretty cool!! Hope I’m not the only one watching this during the summer trying to get ahead to make chem easier this school year 😂 Hi lol naw I\\'m just bored AF No, I\\'m in 7th grade and watching it for fun! Megan Marie I wish I had videos like this in HighSchool. yassienE4935 real ones are watching now to study That nerd who watches this during the summer to get a year start before chemistry on the fall.... ... *looks away Me. Hellooooooooooo @LSDB oooooooooh that was smooth brotha😎 Back in my sophomore year, my teacher never taught us any of these. Instead, of actual chemistry lecture, he gave us articles and forced us to highlight, annotate, and write an essay about it ( more work than my actual English class). Now I have to take a Chemistry placement exam in one week, and I glad that I found you guys or else I will fail and have to pay for more classes in college. 6:03 Ms Frizzle is there :( YAYYYYYY Chemistry can literally blow your head. This is the only good joke here u need more likes How this guy looks like 18 and 40 at the same time?? That intro was a hook\\nAnd I\\'m here for it\\nI love science but my teacher can\\'t teach u know ur a nerd when ur watching this outside of school in quarantine Me watching this with Spice Girls playing in the background: \\nYeah my life is pretty stable \"atoms are just a theory\" a science theory Every student is praying for Hank to be their teacher Hank is cool he inspires me @Rosenie Logrono the guy in the video presenting chemistry Talking tom and friends Who is hank So true 😅 \"the amazing and beautiful science of stuff\" i\\'m so sold Hi fellow Army who is trying to learn chemistry\\nLove your pp He sounds damn drunk on 0.75 Hank: If you give me five minutes to try to....\\n\\nMe: OOHHHHH HEELLLLL NAWWWWW (runs away) I\\'M UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING I\\'M SO HAPPY even though i have to repeat some parts but YES I GET IT I love this course. It\\'s been a favorites playlist for a while for me. I constantly come back to re-watch this course. \"Please do not run away screaming\" 😂 E = MC^2\\nExcellence = MoustacheCoolness^2 Cramming for finals tomorrow: watch hank and/or john green 5:41 actually there was a mountain, Cerro Rico, made mostly out of silver, that supplied like 80% of the worlds silver. How do you react when you hear that oxygen and magnesium are dating? \\nOMG ah yes, a good chemistry joke :> Kill me actually MgO I LOVE Hank as a teacher and LOVE Crash Course (Chemistry)\\n2:25 “...the matter was truly settled...” \\n\\nHa! Pun. Well, Hank...you are great... You summed up weeks of chemistry cramming classes in one 10 minute video of Crash course chemistry! An ion walks into a bar and says to the bartender: \"I think I lost an electron on the way in.\"\\n\\nThe bartender says: \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\nThe ion says: \"I\\'m positive.\" You win Except it would be a cation, not anion. Lmao I love it Imma say this to my science teacher but y tho Saw a meme once:\\nIf electricity comes from electrons. Then does morality come from morons? Who else just loaded this up on their screen and watched other YouTube videos instead, their mouse hovering over the cross for when their parents come in and then see them watching this video (but secretly you were watching random ASMR videos). \\n\\n…Probably just me. anyone else here because they have to self study chemistry to take AP Biology Like a frigging alien language.  Oh well, I\\'m trying my best to improve my grade in Chem :) I\\'m taking chemistry for the first time virtually through my college and I have been nervous. This  video helped out so much. Thank you, Hank! you are the best , i will try to like EVERY VIDEO i watch ^_^ thank you . 2:25 that the MATTER was truly settled OH SNAP I *would* run away screaming, but I can\\'t so let\\'s just go with this. Neutron: Hey, proton.\\nProton: Yes, what is it?\\nNeutron: You seem rather faint, are you sure you\\'re charged?\\nProton: I\\'m *_positive_* Thats a good one @Ahsen Mirza sure That’s why we are nerds Someone give me a 🔪 )))))))) imagine if no one ever developed \"chemistry\" I\\'ll be enrolling into Biochemistry most likely next Fall, so I want to get a good review! Lots of time which is good for me. Hope I get into the college/university of my dreams. This guy is a fabulous instructor!\\n\\nHis enthusiasm is contagious and he really has a way of explaining things in a way that is simple yet effective. Yeah, so uh.... I skipped a couple of grades (6 grades actually) and I\\'m going into grade 12 blind and with chem in my studies. Soooo.... wish me luck! Adam Einstein beyler. Efe Aydal as bayraklari as as as yup, beyler is right Every time he said atoms, I heard Addams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Addams [family] were proved by Einstein, people! 0:03 I\\'m not running away screaming, I\\'m staying. Chemistry is one of my favorite science subjects. (astronomy is on the same level) Also the one I\\'ve done best in school. 1:17 its brooklyn or bailey.... When is Crash Course: Quantum physics??? Im waiting for it What do you do to a dead chemist?\\n\\nYou Barium! Funny 😁 That’s actually pretty funny Nice Dont lol i thought it was actually pretty funny watching this during outbreak cos i have nothing better to do. Two atoms are talking to each other, one keeps looking frantically through his pockets, again and again, finally the other atoms \"What, what is it?\"..... \"I.....I think I lost an electron\" .........\"Are you positive?\\' well after watching this now i love chemistry Whoa! your videos actually keeps me stick towards the subject, no matter how much the boring topic it will be.\\nThank you so much Sir for your efforts. I am very much grateful to you.\\nBlessings from India. :) Gonna watch all of these before school on Thursday. lool Hopefully I\\'ll breeze by the class. Chemistry makes me want to ingest carbon atoms triple bonded to nitrogen atoms. Crashcourse ;u; could you do some math related courses that would be really awesome ;o; fun fact - praseodymium, prase means pig in czech language 🐖 so i call it the piggy element 🐽 Great. Never imagine so young a man can do it. So, the Periodic Table was developed way before Einstein proved the existence of atoms? I love his voice. Just nice to hear and your interest will be pique until the end. Ok, I will not be running away screaming xD Hey guys, did you know that you can cool yourself to –273.15ºC and still be 0k? No because that is absolute zero which is impossible to reach dont start Hahaha Not if your under water Actually, you would be deconstructed into your basic structures due to the immense energy of the firewall. Also, you will, theoretically, travel into the future. Good luck on the exams tomorrow everyone! Did you hear about the wedding between Oxygen and Potassium?\\nNeither did I, but they said it was O.K. Reviewing because I need to take a chemistry placement assessment test on Wednesday This is the most intresting class I\\'ve ever taken😐never thaught learning could be fun😐I\\'m shocked 😍thank you Gonna throw this here for anyone who wants it~\\n1:48 Atomic Theory\\n2:34 Brownian (spelling?) Motion\\n4:22 Properties of the nucleus\\n7:32 Relative Atomic Mass & isotopes\\n8:44 Chemical Symbol horsecrazy2266 thanks horsecrazy2266 it\\'s in the description of the video too horsecrazy2266 thank you so much im stidying rn Hahaha :) @YayaJada\\xa0@Vaishali D\\xa0 @YayaJada\\xa0Exactly. OK you literally just saved me! I have a huge test on all the gcse chemistry topics tomorrow I would love to learn chemistry as my English is a bit limit so I hope that someone offers me some advice on how and when I should begin Never took chemistry but this helps out a lot. First time you didnt know something in your video. Love it lol he talked so fast i must use the subtitles i guess i am stupid \"but it wasn\\'t until Einstein mathematically proved the existence of atoms and molecules ... that the MATTER was truly settled\" +1 to the writers woaaaah Kitkat915e  that went right over my head! Lol Lol, I\\'ve watched this video a million times(mainly for fun😊) and I never noticed that...😐😐 😳😊😆😲😯😯 The sound design is brilliant! Amazing! It\\'s so passionately and patiently done for all the episodes of CrashCourse..❤️ Thank you Hank and whoever is involved behind the scenes. This is such a great help. More power! The start of this video makes me want to study chemistry after high school \"Nucleai are Bohring\". I see what you did there. i`m hoping this helps for gen chem bc my teacher didnt record lectures and i dont understand it anyway >_< Every time I hear people say \"pronounce it like nucleus, not nucleus.\" or \"nuclear, not nuclear.\"\\n I\\'m like \"you just said the same word twice, they those pronunciations sound exactly the same to me.\" HANK!!!  You have done the AMAZING!  I never thought I was smart enough to understand science ....  little did I know that I am actually smart enough!  It was just offered in such a boring way that it was difficult to follow or understand!  Even now I am in a chemistry class and it is not stimulating!  Your series is my main source of understanding concepts that the book may not spell out as clearly (or entertaining).  Even the Khan Academy, despite its best efforts, can not hold a candle to your program.  Keep up the good work and thank you and your entire crew for your amazing work in the field of Chemistry Education! Huzza! ',\n",

       " 'It started out as a lion, then some rich kid fell into power and put his face on it. Completely believable. @Tifiys 227 they can write anything on paper but the evidence tell\\'s more I\\'m sure that some pharaoh did it, some roman leader wanted to chop the head off a statue of zeus and put his own on it. but died before it happened, he did steal the statue though Earthquake or some other natural “disaster” toppled the head off. Oh wow The “Sphinx” lion was facing its own lion constellation in the sky 12,000 years ago. Whoever built it knew star charts @Mari Winiarski Blacks invented alot of very useful technology but most was stolen and taken credit for........All you gotta do is google it or go to the library because school history books have 60% false info @Zoch Blacks did build the pyramids BUT as slaves it wasnt they idea they were forced too......The story of Moses I think would prove me right @Rahim Floki \"The rest were European\" what? Hahahahaha That profile is certainly black @Rahim Floki \\nBecoming like a meme repeated over and over Why is it far fetched when the sphinx body is a fricking LION Cricket Shoes  Hahaha you killed it. No answer from him. @Mort atlantis is a myth about \"the sea people\" many civilizations were raided by google it. egyptians didn\\'t build pyramids though for sure. Yup, this guy seems really impressed with himself for discovering something obvious. @Azarilh its possible @Dead Pizza But the Sphinx couldn\\'t be made by dynastic Egyptians, so maybe even they didn\\'t know what animal it was because the head was probably alread ydamaged. The Sphinx must have been beautiful when first unveiled. @Octogon Smuggler probably was painted white like the pyramids... As a lion, yes @Raymond Palmer lolol \"Satan\\'s gravestone\"... now THAT took imagination!! @James W Roberts Jr \"Joseph\"???? Is there anything modern day that is as timeless as these Egyptian wonders? “Reader’s theory sounds far fetched”\\n\\nReader:  *makes most logical explanation in Egyptology* Smithsonian has been destroying Egyptian history and covering it up for a long time. A civilization before that of the pharaoh with its own religion, etc.  The \\'sphinx\\' is a remnant of an earlier age... \"readers theory sounds far fetched\" - actually, it makes total sense and has me convinced. it better reason is old one must damage so they replace it with something else... @surivis lion *\"You just want to be convinced.* The sphinx has the face of a black African Nubian.\"\\n\\n\\nProjection is strong in this one. exactly You just want to be convinced. The sphinx has the face of a black African Nubian. Luke R whites talking about egyptian things is totally wrong and misleading \\nIts heresy i say The sphinx was a lion first then carved to be ra\\'s son\\'s face. And Sumerian tablets tell of this all. @JustTakeThemToMcdonaldsno the kind of tablets in your bathrooms medicine cabinet \\nI suggest you ingest them all at once @NoogahOogah kindle for amazon @NoogahOogah Amazon FireKindle. Which tablets? ThisIsNotMyRealName 😂 This is NOT a new theory: it\\'s been in circulation for a century or more, to the point were even H.P. Lovecraft mentions it in an early story. It was a anubis. Oh yeah! The Sphinx is HUGE and it\\'s forepaw\\'s the size of a fully grown hippopotamus! ur gettn it. ☝ This is true, my ginger cat just confirmed it to be so. Bad kitty Ginger cats are very smart and probably related to the original lion sphinx.  :) So, why make such a great effort into building such a huge thing? A lion tends to protect, it\\'s a big symbol for protection. I am 100% convinced that there are secret rooms underneath the Lion... and the Lion is meant as a symbol of protection. \\u200b@Jeremy Kirkpatrick No, it\\'s about the symbol. I have seen multiple lion statues that are very old, but it can stand for protection. \\n\\nAlso, in that case the lion would be protecting the enclosure, that\\'s what i\\'m talking about. Nobody would dare to enter the enclosure. So if you walk into a lions enclosure it\\'s going to protect you right Of course there are. There must be. 👍 John Dough \\nTrue tho @John Dough sir why govt are not allowing to dig secretroons it is said it has a library which contains several books of ancient revords \"This Wasn\\'t Supposed to be a Sphinx\"\\nexcuse me, but it NEVER  WAS a sphinx ....\\na sphinx has wings, this has none, therefore its not a sphinx ;) @Mark Abrams It would certainly make a lot of sense if it was originally Seth. Despite having been widely worshiped for ages, he fell from grace rather harshly after the Hyksos expulsion. His monuments were demolished and defaced all over Egypt, so it would make sense that they would go to the extreme of re-carving the Sphinx to remove his likeness. @Mark Abrams hm.. Very interesting, never heard this one. Makes a lot of  sense. It was a Jackal, there in symbolic guard of the Kingdom. It wasn\\'t anubis it was seth...!!!!! @Brenda F I read your.....u so dumb post....... Are you getting the thaughts ,. I\\'m getting right now? Doesn\\'t sound \"far-fetched\" to me. I was sold on his theory immediately. There’s a boy who said he was from mars in his past life and he said he said there’s something in the Sphinx that if you open will change the world. Said it might be the ear. 50+ yrs ago. It was a lion!  Representing the leo constellation Rob - \\nEgypt was build by brown africans. Back in the ancient world when Africa was the dominant continent. @Rob - so that doesn\\'t prove anything, all white people are Caucasian but not all caucasoids are white. For example horn Africans are black but still caucasoid. And Sekhmet.\\nThe eye of Ra.\\nHis daughter...\\nScorpio @cosmicVox13 only anubis guards the underworld @NEGUS MBARKA because egyptologists are lying thieves. whites must tell truth Greeks called it the \"sphinx\", the true Kemetians referred to it as Heru on the horizon. @M C I knew someone would actually represent the sun God. @Starri X yes, you are correct sir that is one of the forms of Horus Horus had a winged lion body and eagle head right? Thats another reason to link my theory of it originally meant to be horus heru is a derivitive of horus High grade ancient vandalism @Bouche Caldwell no. It\\'s  2020 Napolean Bonapart was the most recent vandal.  The nose is missing due to cannons. Finally some people are waking up to this idea. I heard about it decades ago, and it makes sense. \"HE FOUND A STONE CARVING OF A LION\" BUT THEY DIDN\\'T CARE TO EXPLAIN HE FOUND IT ON GOOGLE HAHAHAHAHAHAWHAHHA By Dr okay play Paradise by the dashboard In The emerald tablets of Thoth, Thoth the Atlantean says he carved a lion and parked his space ship underneath. He later goes on to say he carved the pyramids too so it made me suspect he meant the sphinx. A few years back a cavern was detected under the sphinx but the Egyptian authorities won\\'t let anyone dig there?! It sounds crazy but very suspicious.... That sounds like New Age stuff, not science. @Pedro Gouveia Lol Lol,  toth parked his spaceship \\nXD I can already feel the bullshit new age crap i thought it was a lion when i first seen it too- ...”The Sphinx, the Greek etymology of which expresses the idea of embracing or tightly holding, is composed of four parts taken from four symbols. These are the head of a WOMAN, the body of a BULL, the paws of a LION and the wings of an Eagle. This fanatic combination is divested of monstrosity as soon as the meaning of the symbols is understood.\\n The WOMAN’s head personified human intelligence, which has to consider the aim of its aspirations, its mean of attaining them, the obstacles to be avoided and the barriers to be broken.\\n The BULL’s body means that person, armed with science, goaded by a tireless will and bearing the yoke of each trial with ox-like patience, must slowly travel by his own road towards success or failure.\\n The LION’s paws mean that, in order to attain the aim set by his intelligence, person must not only desire he/she must also venture; it is not enough merely to work, it is necessary sometimes also to fight and to make a place for oneself by force.\\n The EAGLE’s wings, folded over Sphinx’s powerful mass, mean that person must hide his/her plans beneath a thick veil until the moment comes to act with a resolution that if need be reaches the heights of audacity.\\n The Sphinx was therefore neither an idol nor the devouring monster imagined by Greek fables: it was the symbol of the incalculable strength that can be used by the human will when directed by highest intelligence.” The head was originally the head of a jackle. Anubis. I doubt it. Most likely lion @THE SERPENT KING No @kirk kopak The smaller sphinx, which was once a lion (you can obviously still see the mane), has much longer front legs as well. So, the Great Sphinx could possibly still be once a lion (which is actually more probable, especially given the fact it was built long before Anubis or jackals were worshipped). @John West The smaller sphinx, which was once a lion (you can obviously still see the mane), has much longer front legs as well. So, the Great Sphinx could possibly still be once a lion (which is actually more probable, especially given the fact it was built long before Anubis or jackals were worshipped). The smaller sphinx, which was once a lion (you can obviously still see the mane), has much longer front legs as well. So, the Great Sphinx could possibly still be once a lion (which is actually more probable, especially given the fact it was built long before Anubis or jackals were worshipped). It’s from earlier civilizations than Egyptians. I thought everybody knew that It was Garfield LOL!.. The Smithsonian needs to open up about all the things they have hidden from the public. Look at recent book (2019) Unearthing the Lost World of the Cloudeaters- Stephen Quayle explains all Jeff vw u r a genius sir Mr. Smithson,  founder of the Smithsonian Institute was a 33rd degree mason forget about them coming clean.  They never do.  They jeff vw \\n\\nLike Giants 😉 What do we do when we move into a new home? we make it our own. We erase all and any signs of anyone living in the home prior. I have always believed this is what occurred with the the Egyptians. I do not believe the Egyptians built the pyramids. If you look around the area everything else has decayed, that is what the Egyptians built also look at the Sphinx the head which has been replaced by the Egyptians. Again making it there own. I am not saying this was to deceive any but needed somewhere to reside whether it be by a war or an abandon city. Debra King not to mention all the casing stones that were taken off and became a part of people’s dwellings. @Lotyle Lemon hope ur joking Sudanese and ethiopian?\\nIts egyption 100% stop trying to get credit for something u didn\\'t do @Victor Jackson what are you talking about no one saying anybody is white stop being brainwashed by the current cultural Marxist propaganda that\\'s trying to demonize white people he\\'s saying they were middle easterners which is proven by DNA records SomeRandomGuyOnYouTube I think you\\'ve been around super Egyptians a little too long. SomeRandomGuyOnYouTube you need to stop making everyone in the world white everything is not white. In believe it back then you didn\\'t exist. No white folks back in Africa in that time. All Nubians Ethiopians. It was an outcropping.   Then, about 12 to 15,000 years ago, humans transformed it into a lion.   Then, about 4,000 years ago, pharaohs transformed it into a tiny-headed lion-thingy. @War Zone lol 🤦\\u200d♂️ \\n\\nOm War Zone Nope. Water erosion caused by massive rainfall nixes that theory. @War Zone dude, open your eyes and look at things with a new perspective. Not with the mainstream narrative that\\'s been shoved down our throats our whole lives! No, I don\\'t think so. It is possible the sphinx was made within a few hundred years after the pyramids. Then you woke up screaming ? More of a dog like shape that cat like...look at the back legs.. @surivis lion  vandalism and the front legs. and the best part is the bulge between the shoulders like a jackal. i think the jackal had a neck adornment kind of like the one thats on the human face now. True but the face is that of a black soul brother, not a dog, lol UNCOVER WHATS BEHIND THE SPHINX EAR a tick Funny no. the mystery is beneath it. By by what is the lowert part of the ears of the sphinx please explain?!   \\n\\n0:27 is this button? expalin please! So this is finally making it into the mainstream, eh?....lol! It\\'s about fuckin\\' time. I\\'m not so sure it was a lion though. It could have just as easily been a jackal. Jackal sculptures are very similar in the body to the way they created the lions. Riddle of the Sphinx (a person crawls as a child,,,,, walk\\'s as an adult,,,,,, uses a stick when old)..... Given the larger timescale that seems most plausible, the jackal would’ve been the creature of the day. The question I need answered is what’s in the block below the Sphinx’s right ear ? What’s in there The key to the ship what else# THE SMITHSONIAN IS PART OF \"THE\"COVERUP!!! Look at recent(2019) book Unearthing the Lost World of the Cloudeaters- Stephen Quayle explains all People be blind and deaf man, oh sorry, i mean...Yo? I remember vividly. When I was a wee tad and Dad ran the construction crew, they were making a lion. Yall need to watch Mudfossil University, channel WHATS IN THE CAVERN 30FT BELOW THE LEFT FOOT.? ANCIENT CIVILISATIONS RECORDS. I\\'m only here to say SMITHSONIAN  has single handedly destroyed history & or changed it or kept it secret Yup... I posted this earlier..\\n\\nFor some, if not all of them, they were black faces, and hacked in an effort to erase history. One of the first ever built was made by King Khafre, who happened to build “something” in his image aside from all of the other pyramids that were built around that time (Like 2,500BC). My guess is, wielding such great power and influence, this was the best way to show your low- swinging *unmentionable.*\\n“They were building a lion.” These historians really *forget* that part of the narrative. Stop lion. this video is in the process of doing just that Well, definitely not single handedly, it took alot of coercio....I mean cooperation! Their involvement in covering up human history is certainly note worthy though The question is why were these lion heads reshaped to look like human heads? D. Thomas lenin and kim jong un statues come to mind Because men stopped worshipping the God above and made themselves gods...\\nNothing much had changed really when you consider it. We knew 40 years ago.  How bout some new information for once. When in Egypt recently for a level 2 QHHT course during one of the demonstrations where one of our instructors was put under trance to demonstrate how to properly do proper line of questioning in past life regression a story was revealed of a young man who went on a journey of exploration with two others and stumbled upon what had to have been the Sphinx, but it was described as having the head of a lion. The rest of the story is amazing and to most would seem unbelievable, but to those of us who have experienced the power of QHHT we know that it has over the 50+ years of its practice revealed a multitude of hidden knowledge that was later found to be substantiated by additional historical and archeological evidence. He’s not....LION!! The head has been recut n filled in many times.  Photos from the 1920s show nearly half the Left side was crumbled away.  The lips have been re-sculptured.  This is why most old photos show only the Sphinx’s rt side in pics.  Lion is not an unusual idea... many have thought that through-out the decades. Ancient Egypt:\\n\\nAmerican: And the AAAANSWER. Looks more like their interpretation of dogs. Where do you think the term \"DOG MAN\" comes from? Ding ding ding! someone give this guy a medal The idea the Sphinx was a lion to start with at an earlier date was mention in the documentary \"mystery of the Shpinx\". It does kind of make sense also the idea it was originally a jackal for Anibus also makes sense.\\n\\nImo if it was just an animal originally it likely got re-discovered with a damaged head so the Pharoh at that time had the head re-carved in his image. There are more carvings of this with a pharaoh head ijs So this was supposed to tell us something 99% of the population already knows. I pretty sure ever person the first time looking at tbe Sphynx can tell the proportions are off But people don\\'t usually think, they just absorb whatever they hear even lies. Common sense will tell you this is the truth. But for some reason egyptologists will tell you otherwise. They claim it was all built at the same time. The sphynx and the great pyramid were supposedly built by khufu in around 2500 bc. I don\\'t understand how they can make these claims, to me the evidence is literally staring them right \"in the face\" it is 36000 years old. It perfectly lines up with the leo constellation ell oh effing ell. 22 bazillion. \\nexplain precession to me. Not 12k? SHOW ME WHATS BELOW THE SPINX EAR DAMMITTTTT It\\'s one of many entrances to beneath the sphinx. They\\'ve covered them up for some suspicious reason. Something\\'s down there. @Mort there are rectangular cutouts, that on the right side looks a bit like a crudely plugged opening. Leading some to hypothesise it\\'s an entrance to an interior chamber. Looks more like attachment points for a decorative piece, maybe earrings to me.\\nTake a look at Ancient Architects channel he has a video about them with lots of pictures so you can judge for yourself. chamber Is there something there?? Genuinely interested Underneath the right ear looks like there could have been a door or an entrance there at one point in time This was way older than the pyramids, i just want to know what it looked like when it was first made You & everybody else bro. 👍 after \\'ancient aliens\\' \\nI can\\'t tell if these shows are amazing or complete bs anymore \"the reader\\'s theory seems far fetched\" uhmm no it doesn\\'t it makes total sense to me and probably to everyone else who has a mind What is called the sphinx today, use to be a lion like statue in antiquity. Look in the neck of the sphnix theirs a great historical power in the neck of it I think more and more we are finding mysteries that we never knew about or that history ever talked about which is fascinating!!! My theory:\\nStarted as a statue of Anubis built by Cheops\\nKhufu makes it into Sphinx\\nRich Thutmose from like several thousand years later restores the head and has a \"dream\" Horus makes more sense Yeah, right. Lol \"dream\" Keeps track on a galaxy year when its gaze hits two brightest stars in Taurus its a full revaluation of the galaxy Giza is part of the clock \"Originally this wan\\'t a Sphinx at all, it started as a _______.\"  A what?  Please speak English, clearly.  A lion?  Get  in line.  The best part of this video was that it was under 4 minutes.  Keep it up! What’s your point? The video sounded clear enough to me. Some man destroyed it so we\\'ll never know, that\\'s what men do they smash and destroy things.  I wouldn\\'t rule out Griffin, Dogman, Draco or Sabretooth, or something we have not thought of, afterall, it has been drastically altered the back is way too flat... Napolean did it.  Honestly, on expedition. I think we have a genius 😂😂 Go to Europe and work on your Sphinx. tails wrong, old Dynasty protector was Anubis look at the figurine of Anubis from King Tut\\'s tomb I believe it is I totally agree with the reconfigured monument,the destruction and transformations are hideous,but acceptable for the period and times,the findings have merit. Anubis is perfect in that place as the guardian of the \"land of death/resurrection\" like a Cerberus guarding the entrance of Ades as for the ancient greek mith. I find most of the good things we should know about are covered up...... They are, Smithsonian tells their version of it without consulting the native people in the region about its actual history. How do you *hypothesize* history? definitely Anubis, The Egyptians did everything to very precise proportions. The Sphinx does not conform to that of a lion. It looks just like Anubis guarding the Temple of Osiris (the great pyramid). And it is far more ancient than people suggest having been built at least 20 thousand years ago, well before the great ice age. I\\'ve researched this enough to realize that history isn\\'t always about what exists, but more of what is missing from the years in between. That there is amazing, no dynamite just men with axe like tools. But I still am more amazed by it standing the test of time.  U \\'betcha all the stuff i learned in school just got thrown out the window, ftw I always thought that it was accepted archaeology already, that the human face of the Sphinx had been carved much later. It has always seemed obvious to me that the original head had been a lion\\'s head. And look at the Stone of the face itself, it’s not even the same color as the rest of it. Looks completely out of place. There is a ship inside of it I have always thought ever since I set my eyes on the sphinx, that it resembled a lion, so he\\'s got a good point,the body of it is exactly like the body of a lion.  ,,???? Me to as a young girl and in this video when they showed the statue where they say you can see the lion ear still there why is the nose so pointy just curious I agree with him I think the Sphinx was a lion sitting there and if they look deep enough they might find its tail and that tail will be have a fur ball on the end of it like a lion It has a tail that rests on its right hind leg. Egypt has changed so much since  the Sphinx was built so has the Sphinx it self we may never know the intentions of the Artists in Stone , all the World loves a mystery ! Some say it has everything to do from the LEO constellation and nothing to do with the animal!\\nWhat are your thought! humzilla707 not trying to argue. Maybe the “Sphinx” has been redone  several times. Maybe it was all of these things. Anubis, Lion, Kurfu. Several close ups of monument clearly show it has been redone at some time. Just interesting. The amount of erosion is also odd. I would have to recheck pictures but I think that it is the only monument on Giza Plateau that shows this type of erosion. @Jon Bishop ya because its been reconstructed to look like a lion lol.  Look at the first pics when they dug it out of the sand, Anubis paws donald boucher could be especially when you consider how it lines up with the rising of the constellation of Leo. The precession of the earths rotational axis of roughly 25772 years allows for each age of progression to last an average of 2148 years. Each constellation being observable for that number of years. Thus the 12 different signs  of the zodiac being an amount of time on a much greater clock. Most people who see it in person say the whole Sphinx appears to look more like a lion than you’d think. I guess MGM lost the contract. It spent most of its life buried under the sand yet had enough time to be heavily eroded by WATER lol 😂. It was built in the Egyptian Zep Tepi aka “ the first time”. It is at the very least 12,000 years old. :D The winds of time shift the sands of time. I always wondered why the Sphinx\\'s head was far too small for its body. If it started out as something else (whether a lion or Anubis) and was later changed, that makes perfect sense and it\\'s not unheard of for monuments to have had alterations. Very true 👍 It originally was a lion,the ancient Egyptians stole it. Heru \\nIt wasn’t made by Egyptians obviously. Stole what? The sphinx was most likely carved during the Age of Leo, when Egypt was pre eminent and the importance of the lion paramount.  The Age of Taurus followed, with the rise of Babylon and ultimately Persia - the bull motif in their cities was legion .  We are now at \"the dawning\" of the Age of Aquarius  and most nation\\'s primary concerns are with protecting nature, the rivers and oceans, all reliant on water.  \\n\\nThe Horoscope as we know it is older than we can possibly imagine, the Signs were not chosen at random but part of that great mind that spoke us into being. Anubis. Built the same time as the Pyramids circa 12000 BC if not before. The Dynastic Kings make multiple references that it was ancient in their time and built by \"The Magicians\" or \"the Builder Gods\". Read the Primary Texts. I have always thought this. Well, it was never a lion to begin with.. Lions have a trademark tuft at the end of its tail and the Sphinx does not have this clearly visible tuft.  Millions and millions of dogs were found mummified in Egypt and probably makes more sense the Sphinx was  at some point modeled to look more like a dog than a lion.. It\\'s a jackal? Jackal. Jackal? Juss stop @Orange Kid its a flat out lie. it was originally anubis, not a lion, look at the chest bulge that is like the one on a jackal sculpture of the same era they claim it was built...smh. also the tail is exactly as a jackals, and the front legs are longer than a lions.....so i mean.... there lieing, they decided this lie is better than the last. BTW the greek defintion of sphinx was a lion with wings so..this video is argueing that it is a sphinx,not that its not a shpinx. USA is the best 1. The early Egyptian/kemetian time scale is arguable, as you seem to partially admit, which would possibly alter the constellation. 2. If I\\'m not mistaken, it was akhenaten, among others who attempted to bring back Anubis, but akhenaten was admittedly trying to bring back the ancient, forgotten ways.  3. A Sphinx replica, with accurate dimensions to the actual found in Tutankhamen tomb, was an image of Anubis.\\n\\nThat\\'s where I\\'m at Its a dog. The head of the dog was built over the face we see today but it was removed. Hence the small proportion. Lmao Family Guy reference That\\'s fascinating, because so of my research, the research I\\'ve seen from others, and ideas of what its features could\\'ve originally been are that of Anubis (a jackal)... I\\'ve never heard of it possibly being a lion. The Anubis theory seems to fit better and make more sense. Also, I\\'m really getting into the research that shows it might have been hundreds of thousands of years old, due to the water erosion around it which could\\'ve only come from a time when the climate was far different than it has been for hundreds of thousands of years. I\\'m sure there is a ton of evidence we haven\\'t been allowed to see, carefully kept quiet by the Egyptian government because this would completely shatter everything we\\'ve been taught to believe, etc. Anyway Yes its very old The foot had a single long finger.\\nIt was originally carved as an aye aye. The Proportions are Wrong Simply Because they Meant it this way < And it cannot be right. > as in fact it is not right > \\nBut the Choices you make depend on you ... not on him.\\nThe water tab on this special one was left Open from the beginning of its creation until the last Pyramid of the 3.\\nAs he is also divided into 3 main parts \\nThe body \\nThe head \\nThe paws and the tail\\n\\nThe secret that lays was never with only 1 or 2 Pharaohs. \\nIt is in between them.\\nThe secret is hidden in between the stones where you cannot lay a Razor blade. \\n\\nThe Missing cartouche. TUt-ankh-amoun < that\\'s when the whole world would consider you crazy.\\nLike all the rest of people who actually wanted to say the truth. I can\\'t wait for time machines. I wish somebody would hurry up and invent them. and honestly I think the lost civilization of Atlantis existed at one time  before it perished and I think some of the survivors of atlantis fled to Egypt and thoth was one of them who helped and taught them with the knowledge in egypt and somewhere I read that the annunakis had a hand in Egypt\\'s first creation of its existence... WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THIS WAS DONE BY BLACK PEOPLE I could probably find any shape and if i sit far back enough it would fit the shape..\\n\\nThe sphinx was a indian temple u can see same thing in india east west orientation carved from solid bedrock a structure enclosed in walls called kailasa temple you need to google earth view from above on both sites too see The Sphinx represents moving forward, or continuing on of \"something.\" As in Egypt is moving away from something.  It stares at the rising sun with it\\'s back to the falling sun. Eemember Egypt was based on as above so below symbolism. The degree of the pyramid slope is 51*. If you trace from the center of the earth a triangle of 51*  from the Sphinx headed directly west and connect the two points, you come to a large submerged island. Egyptians speak of coming from a submerged island, aswell as the west being \"the land of the dead.\" I think Atlantis was real, and I think the pyramid and sphinx were built by a small advanced micro civilization of survivers, who later evolved into the dynastic egyptians. I think this was common knowledge in Egyptian times and has simply been lost. Hundreds of temples underneath the sand in Egypt with depictions of who knows what. If you want to know what all of those locked tunnels are, mostly modern excavation tunnels. It\\'s suspicious to me that no more great findings are found, we don\\'t go deeper, and all officials are corrupt. its a flat out lie. it was originally anubis, not a lion, look at the chest bulge that is like the one on a jackal sculpture of the same era they claim it was built...smh. also the tail is exactly as a jackals, and the front legs are longer than a lions.....so i mean.... there lieing, they decided this lie is better than the last. BTW the greek defintion of sphinx was a lion with wings so..this video is argueing that it is a sphinx,not that its not a shpinx. FOR SO LONG PEOPLE LIKE THAT HAWAS OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS,,,HAS LIED AND HIDDDEN SO MUCH STUFF,AND SO MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN STOLEN UNDER HIM...IF THEY WANTED TO REALLY MAKE MONEY,,THEY COULD FILM WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SEE,,,BUT NO,THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO....AND WHEN I SAW HAWAS SPEAK,WHEN I WAS A KID,AT 12 YEARS OLD I KNEW HE WAS LIEING.. Um I thought it was a lion in the first place is this just me ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TXTS STATE THAT THE ANIMAL\\xa0GUARDING THE 3 PYRIMIDS IS ANUBIS NOT A SPHINX BUT ANUBIS THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD You are right. The Great Sphinx let me think of the Mycerinus/ Menkaura in the Boston Museum, clearly recut! \"was a lion\"?  Ancient astronaut theorists say \"yes\". Can someone explain why it wouldn\\'t be Sekhmet? \\n\\nAnd if it was, wouldn\\'t it then be likely that the shrine implies protection of someone/artifacts/information of historical relevance within  or nearby?\\n\\nNote: Before anyone criticises, no, I\\'m obviously not an expert. I\\'m just pondering some thoughts Sekhmet is a good theory Interesting theory that could have some validity especially the way the front legs protrude outward at the front in a \"non human\" manner & judging by how some megalithic sites have been reworked by others many centuries later, anything is possible. Closed captioning would be nice. \"Wasnt a sphinx, it was a ??\" (huh) cant make out what he says. Lion ',\n",

If he ended up with Selena it would have made him miserable. She said so many horrible things about him and girl’s he’s been associated with to the public that it would just be toxic. Her fans harass him so much for small things and she nags and complains so much it took a toll on him. He said it himself that dating her, he felt afraid of saying a lot of things because she got mad so easily. So it’s a good idea he married someone like Hailey who wants to work towards a healthy relationship If he ended up with Selena it would have made him miserable.

A K shaped recovery means we have socialism for the rich and cutthroat capitalism for the rest of us emm... Is the socialism a good words for the Americans? You all hate that as I know. I come from China. Exactly! The ones on top get bailed out and given low/negative interest loans to buy up the assets from the people at the bottom. This isn\\'t capitalism, this is corruption. As always. That\\'s a terrible assessment. What we actually have is the culmination of the political class\\'s wet dream of crony capitalism.  The rich and the big boys get to operate and the entrepreneurs and self starters will literally have their doors kicked in and thrown in a cage if they even dare TRY to outcompete and outperform the rich connected people.  It\\'s regulatory red tape on steroids. @El Dimos Karam  If a company gets a bailout it effects the stock and cash on hand of the company, allowing for money to be given to the top (or anyone). However, if you own a company, you grow based on demand, not based on taxes or money in your account. If Ford sells 10,000 cars a year, it would be foolish to build a new factory if the demand stays the same. I\\'ve been saying this since the first lockdown. Nothing economically changed when you really think about it, it just sped up what was already happening- rich people were getting richer and poor people were getting poorer as small businesses that couldn\\'t survive without a few months of income folded and megacorps like Walmart scooped up their customer base. the American government made the predictable decision of Money go brrrrr in the shape of more corporate subsidies as if they weren\\'t already getting enough while everyone else got a very measly stimulus check of $1200 to survive an entire year of pandemic. This is all happening very fast, but wasn\\'t it all already happening? As a late \\'90s child who watched my parents lose their house in the Recession and never financially recover from it, has this not already been happening my entire life? @comment Ah see  now there is the problem.  By offering lower prices for worse products Walmart can drive the small, local business under.  Sure, many of us would pay a little more for the local or greener choice if we can afford it, but many can\\'t.  A good example of this is milk.  You will pay for Walmart\\'s cheap, hormone riddled milk instead of paying more for the better product from the local farmer\\'s market.  As a result your children are malnourished and cannot thrive the way rich kids do.  You buy cheaper food that will end up giving them Diabetes because that is all you can afford.  The American economy is tailor made to keep the poor at the bottom and allow the rich stay on top. @B He I know right? @Nanook128 Pretty simple innit? @B He oh yes, buy gold when you\\'re living paycheck to paycheck.

FED      QE        MADE       ANOTHER       STOCK      MARKET      BUBBLE    ? @yeah I\\'m John Assal I have learnt people are basically all stupid (false information, no information, a fuckton of biases hardwired into our brains). Punishing stupidity with homelessness and possible starvation is the surefire road to the end of civilization. Systems must be engineered to be human-proof to save humanity from it\\'s own idiocy. If that is at all possible. One can only hope. @yeah I\\'m John Assal are we talking about America?? @Chrono-Glitch WaterLily No. There was a clear wrong choice and a clear right choice. Basically the only ones disputing this have a well known bias against reality. Of course those who got us to keep making choices against our own self interests have moved on to the narrative that there\\'s no way to win so we shouldn\\'t bother trying to change now. EE: ...so how do we avoid a K-shaped recovery?\\nEE: Ultimately, it will come down to governments [providing competent legislation]\\nMe in the US: Hahahaha 🤣 welp, we’re f**ked @Nanook128 how? It\\'s true homogeneous societies have less friction it doesn\\'t mean anything specific it\\'s just the human ape brain saying that you know your tribe and trust it. It\\'s not that any one race is better or worse 😆🤣🤣🤣... 😳🥺😭 True, funny & sad all at the sametime. @Lord Jaraxxus found the Nazi. @altrag To be fair, trickle down economics is a straw man for Supply Side and \"competent legislation\" is an oxymoron. @altrag the nordic and asian countries have a surplus of wealth and/or are racially homologous (They would think less of immigrants/foreigners even if they spoke the same language. Tends to happen in more traditional countries.) That won\\'t happen here with a media fanning racial tensions, endless groups of racial identitarians rising and falling, and  the self centered status culture America has.  If you want that kind of progress, we need to get manufacturing on the level that is of china to pay for it all and cause a cultural revolution to not get mad/react at racism (in turn causing an emotional response and giving the attenion seakers what they want) and in stead just think less of that person and move on. Sucks when living beyond your means means paying rent for the one tiny apartment you found within an hour of your job The butthurt started when he said “take personal responsibility” 😂 @Tyler Peterson Maybe California\\'s workers should move to Missouri and commute to their jobs? @ddandymann Yeah, pretty much. @someguy I will happily debate you on any political arena other than American politics. My view on American politics is that it\\'s a complete mess that is way past the point where it is even possible to sort it out. Every time I think of genuine solutions to problems in American politics I also think of the hundreds of reasons why all those good ideas are political impossibilities. I\\'ve taken to calling it Andrew Yang Syndrome after the Democratic candidate who personified just how far American politics is from accepting reformist ideas.\\n\\nFrom my perspective the absolute best that you folks over the pond can hope for, no matter what your political ideology is, is a watered down half measure solution to problems. Additionally I feel incredibly sorry for you with your options for President. Last election you had a choice between an incompetent ego-maniac and a corrupt politician who personifies the DC establishment. This election you have the same ego-maniac against a doddering old fool who may have dementia who\\'s best policies are ripped off from his rival candidates for the Dem nomination. It really is a spectacular mess.\\n\\nIt\\'s also the only comfort looking at the mess that is politics in my own country, \\'At least it\\'s not as bad as American politics\\'. I will actually agree that people in the west, or at least the US, are entitled, but I think it goes beyond wanting more for less. The rich are very entitled - when they buy a home, they think they are buying the neighborhood. If there were no zoning regulations, or if it was commonplace to use eminent domain to replace sprawling detached homes with highrise condos to address shortages, or if we switched to a Georgist land value tax, people\\'s attitudes and expectations around urban planning and real estate would change rapidly. 死-shaped recovery:\\n\\nYou are already dead. 😂 great video until you put forward the idea that the \\'individual\\' has a significant power to prevent or \\'be on the right side\\' of the k-shaped recovery. if you think about who influences public policy and how, you\\'d quickly realise that is not far off from \\'just don\\'t be poor lol\\'. K shaped recovery... It\\'s basically named for Keynesians.\\nThe bottom leg of the K is a result of government interference in the economy like say, locking down states and cities or enforcing draconian health codes on businesses that already run razor thin margins. @Stardust Nation i dont care one data point does not make stats Look at who influences public policy?? That\\'s a bit of an antisemitic canard don\\'t you think? @Steven Brunwasser why quote responsibility? also how would one word discredit an entire video? seems to me this is a major issue with YOU one warning flag is not the reason to pull a fire alarm Larry Cai do you buy starbucks through uber eats everyday? Do you shop in amazon? Subscribe to 5 video streaming sites? Buy 5 air Jordans? Everytime I hear people complain and say the exact same things you say, I actually realize that they\\'re practicing a lot of bad financial habits like the few I\\'ve mentioned above. There are many things we can do that\\'s within our control, and I agree with EE that that entails a massive rethinking of the American dream and expectations. C-shaped recovery: The economy goes back in time before coming back to the present. @Adblock HitHer • 10 years ago Oh, snap!\\n\\nSo that\\'s the true plan of the cabal...\\n\\n😂 I\\'m more of a mind that this suited those poised for the cyclical consolidation of power.

D-shaped recovery: Robin Hood is resurrected and does what he does best @Adblock HitHer • 10 years ago \"economy, do a flip!\" Let\\'s put it this way if Biden wins we are funked.

Poor people: \"I have always had enough money.\"\\nRich people: \"living within your means = living beyond your means\"\\nPoor people: \"I\\'m starting to understand Robin Hood\" Kind of ignore the wealth siphoning effect that having large corporations snapping up massive amounts of property in order to rent them later after people foreclose or are forced to sell to stay afloat. The constant increasing of rent seeking behaviors is one of the major drivers to prolonged growth in wealth inequality. Hard to drag yourself out of the working class with such a large portion of your country\\'s economy built off the concept of leeching profits out of your need for shelter. It is not only that, universities do the same while selling their courses. Governments charge you for issuing a document etc. . There is no compassion for other people today.

So saying that \"literally every single economist with any qualification or education\" disagrees with me is a bit disingenuous. I guess you don\\'t think any of these economists opinions matter because they disagree with you (https://www.epi.org/economists-in-support-of-15-by-2024/) \\u200b@Ben Thomas So despite the fact that literally every single economist with any qualification or education says minimum wage is bad, you somehow think an investopedia article is right?\\n\\nNo wonder this country is where it is today, so many like you running around. @Jellyfrosh That\\'s actually only true in theory.

The thing is, the upper class WANTS the K. This is a pathetic analysis. The idea that the working stiff has to tighten their belts some more so that we can continue this system of cyclical recession/depression robbery that efficiently sucks up the wealth of the 90% into the pockets of the 10% is lunacy. This is not a sustainable economy. Most folks in the US don\\'t have the resources for a $500 emergency, and you think they need to save more?  The solution is to have a very aggressive wealth tax with no loopholes for both individuals and corporate entities. We need to acknowledge that to have a society where millions are living below the poverty line and less than 50 individuals have more wealth than 75% of our population combined is not a social good. Nobody needs more than a billion dollars to live, and we should make it very hard to have that amount of money and have an upper limit on corporation market caps, say $50 billion. Billionaires and Trillion dollar corporations are not  a good thing because they put too much political power in the hands of the rich who bribe  and threaten our politicians into ignoring the needs of the general public. Timber Stalker how do you know they work  hard? Timber Stalker define socialist. The Scandinavian countries have much higher levels of happiness than the us, and they are much closer to being socialist. In fact you could say that about nearly all developed nations.

Betting against the (stock) market is a bad move in my opinion. The feds lending program for Wall Street is robust and the near zero interest rates, makes any other investment look like a bad one.

Telling people to \"live below their means\" when a great percentage of the population is barely surviving with the means they already have, even going into debt, is enraging. \\n\\nMost young people were living an American Nightmare even in economic boom. To tell them to \"pull themselves by their bootstraps\" while a minuscule elite profits off of low salaries, never managing to fully realize the connection between the two legs of the K, is stupidity.\\n\\nYour geatest error is not being able to conceive of a society where K-shaped crises are impossible because there is no financial elite. It pushes you to solutions as childish and deluded as \"the government controlled by monopolies should go against their interest to help the masses\" and \"live below your means, even if your means were miserable during economic growth.\"\\n\\nYou\\'d look at the starving Parisian masses marching towards Versailles, proclaim that the King should do something to stop his Court from increasing its wealth, and then turn to the people and tell them to save their bread money to buy cakes. Indeed, most of the stimulus has gone to the wealthy who are not exactly using that money to hire more workers, pay them well and train them for better jobs. There should have a lot of strings attached, but of course, there\\'s no way the US Senate would ever do that and oppose their \"owners\". Thank you! To say nothing of the structural realities that have determined such a massive increase in wealth disparity while proposing individual solutions is absurd. Somehow stagnant wages, ballooning consumer debt, and skyrocketing costs of living are supposed to result in a higher savings rate for \"emergencies\" ? Ridiculous. The only thing that is being overconsumed is the surplus value of the workers who are spending more hours achieving greater productivity for lower wages. A precarious workforce benefits the capitalist class but it does not benefit society, and we do not need to keep feeding this beast. The real question is have we had anything but K shaped recoveries since the early 80s? V shaped recovery is impossible.\\nEvery recovery has always been K shaped, and the K shape is getting worse every time. ”... have an Emergency Fund.”\\nMe: *Sweats in 80% of savings in the stock market* EE starts economy channel in 2019\\n*stonks* Best use of that meme ever. @Laurence Fraser We\\'re looking to go into an O shaped recovery, as in \"oh no\" Shoot for X How about a Z shaped recovery @FJU SPosting how about an O shaped \"recovery\"? My favourite recovery is the L shaped recovery. Or as we say in the industry: The economy taking a big L. Also known as the Japan Economy. The conclusion is a bit over-simplistic. It\\'s easy to say \"we should have multi-generational families\" but we keep forgetting that the nature of modern economy forces a lot of people to relocate in big cities from rural towns.  You cannot have a house and the kindergarten in the package, if the house of your parents is in the middle of nowhere and if they are hours distant from you. This is blaming the victims. Thank you for the viewership boost, Joe! First thing I thought of when he mentioned it, had to come back and get a refresher The western concept that children have to leave their families once they\\'re adult enough to sustain is an extremely flawed concept. This is why most rich families in US or everywhere in general tend to have structures where children live with their families so that they can concentrate the wealth in the family in a more proper way. Most Americans (and Westeners in general) are actually short-sighted in this logic and don\\'t know the benefits on staying with their parents and families. I was thinking just that when I read your message, muti generational living. My experience with grand parents was they liked to see the kids when they where little but didn\\'t what to get there hands dirty so would that really work. Personally I\\'d love to do it. It\\'s not a western concept, just part of american culture, what you describe is uncommon in europe. @comment divorces were rarer back then..till death do us apart was actually practiced..as education and empowerment has come it is rising..but then again people are marrying really late in my country now so I think that too helps..joint family and late marriage..but I think we are all missing the point of saving..but personally for me its more its more emotional decision than economical decision.. @comment their are actually 2 subparts of a joint family thing. The first type of joint family is the one in which grandparents , the sons , daughters , daughters-in-law and all the children live together. This thing has been dying here in Asia since the last century because the houses aren\\'t as large as they used to be. Also , the entire environment used to be extremely toxic ad their used to interference by relatives in every individual decision that one wanted to take. \\nThe second type of family is a more nuclear concept where the parents and the children stay together. The grandparents often stay with one of their children (if their are more than 1 child which usually isn\\'t the case anymore). They can also keep shifting between their children if they are living seperately due to smaller houses these days (usually a 3 or 4 bedroom independent house or apartment) for a few months or years so that everybody gets to live with them. This is generally more preferred way of living. \\nJust wanted to clarify how societies live in Asia these days. \\nI have grown up in a nuclear family where I\\'m still living with my parents and although they are already planning to buy a new house for me and we are already saving money for that , this would only be a temporary thing as I am getting married in a few years and our current house isn\\'t large enough (we live in a 3 bedroom apartment). Once I\\'ll have sufficient savings in 5-7 years , we\\'ll have a larger house and me , my wife , the kids and my parents would all live together. This is actually the most common and ideally preferred way of living. @Larry You know, i don\\'t know where that comes from, but all the young people that age that i know have no problem living with parents at all. Usually they move away only if the job or the education they get demands it or if they get married. Absolute truth! These young i know get along with their peers just as well as with parents and even frequently invite each other over to parents\\' houses. I think these generations are actually very practical and very common sense oriented. Of course NOT the woke ones, i\\'m not even talking about those stupid ones :). I\\'m talking about normal, well raised, balanced young people. \"Living beyond your means has become increasingly easy to do\" should be corrected to \"Living beyond your means has become increasingly hard to avoid due to stagnating wages and inflation\". -_- Anon O\\'mass - The 70s is the time that the US left the gold standard and allowed the banks to play the game of Monopoly with our money, it’s been all downhill since then. One stat I found was in the 60s only 25% of American families were dual income, now that figure is 64% and having added all those extra shifts & hours they still want say people are poor because they’re lazy, irresponsible or addicted. Liam Scott - Tell me, how do you explain away a clip like this: https://youtu.be/GbvNhQ4lYLE\\nThere is only so much scrimping & saving someone can do when you’re headed for the food bank every months. The politicians have rigged the game of life to ensure that the rich get more wealthy, the poor get poorer & the only certainty is that it will get worst. Yeah they don’t talk about how we work harder and get less pay. If you look at a graph of productivity compared to wages the productivity goes up over time and so do the wages until about 1970 and then it stagnates that was when the oil crisis happened and all of this started when they realize that there wasn’t enough meat on the bones for them to keep making as much money as they want and for us to get paid fairly so guess which one they chose to get rid of inflation is always relative to wages, that\\'s why poverty exists, to increase the wage of low skilled workers will increase the price of goods and the goods become more affordable to everyone, prices only reduce during economic downturns, and businesses are smart to ensure providing they turn a profit that they can maximise that profit, interestingly, the baked beans war is an example of this, look into it, it\\'s pretty hilarious but a brilliant example of how competition drives down prices, and supermarkets will match prices according to what  the average household can afford (unfortunately energy is a different matter, while efforts to go green are good for the planet, they do drive up energy costs due to inefficient energy production, if people cant pay their bills then cheaper fossil fuels will rise in energy production, generally the people these coal plants are set up to help in keeping energy costs low are harmed the most as its often the poorer areas that these are built in, short term they do their job, produce energy and provide jobs to poor areas close to where they are built, long term they do damage to the population through the long term health issues associated with coal suet) the other methods of clean energy are feared, mainly nuclear power, however studies have shown that this is a solution to affordable energy, that being that energy bills in France for example are far lower than in natural resources Germany, while we all want a clean planet, there are trade offs, and as always, the poorest of society will bare the brunt of any trade off made, ironically, Nuclear power is actually safer statistically to coal plants, go figure, but like an air plane is statistically safer than driving, when an accident does happen, it happens in a catastrophic manner. As for water, in Scotland we haven\\'t really had a shortage of it ever, and i guess that\\'s because we have some of the highest standards of tap water in the UK, a lot of that is more attributed to sedimentary rock and our mountainous terrain, while drought is an issue that spans the globe, one that should be studied to make water plentiful, available and cheep, it\\'s not an issue that we have ever really had, hence my ability to comment on how to ensure that basic need is supplied i can\\'t say. the bottom line is the economy is more complicated than a lot of people realise, and several factors go into what rich actually is, but part is discipline, save in the good times to prepare for the bad times, and do it when you\\'re young, i\\'m trying to do this now, and i can sympathise as it isn\\'t easy, however, i know it wont get any easier, hence the need to start now, probably the fact i don\\'t go on nights out, drink too often or smoke makes a big difference in the amount of income i can keep saved, while there\\'s nothing wrong with enjoy9ing yourself every now and then, if you set yourself a limit, and don\\'t go over that, and keep these situations to a minimum, you could save a lot of money while wages don\\'t increase in similarity to inflation, they are higher for the common man now more than they\\'ve ever been, as an economy grows, so does inflation grow with it, Krakow in Poland is considered an expensive place to live for many who live in Poland, but to a tourist it\\'s extremely cheep, with money from the exchange rate going a long way, it is 2 fold, the more money you have, the more you spend, on the other hand, many give into social pressure, a good way to save money for example is just eating out less and cut down on non essentials. while easier for some more than others, but I\\'m the type of person that wont throw out an old pair of shoes until my existing ones have a massive hole in them, again, that\\'s how we all vary. \"Someone asked me if I had plans for the fall and it took me a moment to realize they meant \"autumn,\" not the collapse of civilization.\" America has had a k shaped economy beginning with Reagan The great depression was horrible, but it least it was more fair than post-Reagan america The implication of K shaped recovery is that the poor part of the economy never had a recession in the first place. You\\'re describing a y. @Blue Mountain  i think he rotates the y 90 degrees clockwise. As from his interpretation of K shaped, he rotates it anticlockwise The poor people travel back in time? In Chinese they call it a 凸-shaped recovery and a 凹-shaped recovery That\\'s top and bottom in gay lingo in japanese \\'__\" I have a feeling that we are seeing why historically, that societies stratify. Western economies have been \\'K\\' shaped for decades! Since the 1980s, when mass privatisation, de-regulation, and evisceration of the social safety net began, the rich has become richer while the poor has gotten poorer. In every economic crisis since, the rich always recover and pull further ahead, while the poor are left to bear the brunt. Look at the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The poor never recovered from that event before the 2020 pandemic began. The Golden Age of the Western middle & working classes was in the post-war years, 1950 to 1980, when taxes were high, the state owned strategic industries, labour was protected, and governments provided generous social safety net for everyone. \\u200b@Theorimlig i see...well then, i guess that means i am right @Scortch 2000 No @Theorimlig except if not all western countries nationalized industries that would actually make the statement incorrect or if you prefer wrong. First reply to the OP:\\n\"Did the US ever nationalize any industries only to privatize then in the 80s?\"\\n\\nYou answered that reply:\\n\"the answer is no, Pineapplesareyummy is wrong\"\\n\\nBut you are mistaken here. Pineapplesareyummy is not wrong just because some of what he says in the OP does not hold true of the US. @Theorimlig which includes the us, which makes the statement wrong. It is a \"i\" recovery curve. While we return to stoneage the 5% travel to live in the moon. And so we recreate the world of Conan the barbarian hahahaha I love how this channel pretends that the US government actually tries to have stimulus spending affect the common man. Give me a break, they gave bread crumbs to the masses, and socialized the losses from the richest people and companies.\\n\\nEDIT: They view it as a \"moral problem\" to give money to the poor masses. However, at the same time, they view it as obvious that they have to bail out the largest companies. @p0xus aww it was an interesting conversation. @Lord Jaraxxus Your hopeless. Im done. @p0xus i was unclear about it before, in a ubi economy, the rich will get richer beyond what anyone on ubi person could ever dream of. The rich are the ones offering services the people on ubi want but some they would never afford while the rich can keep pricing the poor out of it. you want a house? 2 million dollars. but we will rent it out for 500 a month. \\nThen for the move money out. They can just leave the country, revoke their citizenship and become a citizen of another smaller country before losing their money to dumb tax policy. There would be a transition time before said tax is put in place and in that time the rich will make sure their money is off shore before the tax raise is done. \\nAlso the rich already pay more taxes for the least benefit. Don\\'t bite the hand that feeds you or else they will leave. \\nTLDR: ubi will end up into the rich pockets and too much taxes, rich leave. @Lord Jaraxxus \"the rich got richer and the middle/poor stayed the same\"\\n\\nThe rich did get richer; but everyone else did not stay the same. Their wages did, while things like housing increased in price. That means they got poorer. \\n\\n\" the rich would invest the money in things that can cross borders with little trouble like art or boats and send it off to another country and/or deposit it offshore\"\\n\\nThe time old argument of \"They will just hide the money!\". They pay as little as they can in taxes anyway. If they can get by with paying nothing, they do. Period. Full stop. If they can hide money and not pay taxes on it, they do. If they can lower taxes on certain types of income, they do. And then they get paid almost exclusively in that type of income. Yet another argument from you that doesn\\'t actually hold water when you look at the real world. @p0xus if you also look to back then, the rich got richer and the middle/poor stayed the same. before you say taxes would fix this, the rich would invest the money in things that can cross borders with little trouble like art or boats and send it off to another country and/or deposit it offshore. I solemnly predict that we will have a Æ shaped recovery. This is a Norwegian recovery😊 æææ!\\nAs a Norwegian l can actually pronounce that in several dialects. No we will have a ж shaped recovery Soon after that a 鑰 recovery Light cone-shaped recovery. Basically the working class needs to live in poverty so the capital class can live like royalty. Ok, got it. This already happened in 2008. Half the country never recovered and then in 2016 many of them voted Trump. America is a two-class country at this point with the middle class split in two between those that caught the equities boom and those that depend on a weekly paycheck to stay afloat. The recovery in the 1980s is when this started, but it was NAFTA in 94 that eroded what was left of the traditional working class economy and set the stage for the \"Target economy\" of today. After 2008, suddenly it seemed that a permanent underclass of service workers had formed, unable to break into more stable and higher paying work. These are the same people that have been squeezed the hardest by the real estate boom and the subsequent rise in rents. \"Wealthiest became more wealthy\" \\n*we have nothing to lose but our chains* And our food \"Mom can we have V?\"\\nMom: No, we have V at home\\nV at home: K 70% Americans have less than 1000 USD saved?

Only after though, not \"instead of.\"\\n\\nPeople spend their lives wasting their disposable cash and then blame everybody but themselves when they have nothing to show for it.\\n\\nBut yes I should have elaborated and expanded on my earlier comment. It was oversimplified. Stay safe. @Gerald Tyler Yeah, the rich don\\'t buy electronics, shoes or cars. No sir. I think the true number is 400 dollars. don\\'t know where I heard that though. Edit: Gordon Gekko mentions it too two posts above me with specifics. @J B lol. Like we could afford a pool, let alone a boy to look after it. But good meme. I\\'m pretty certain this statistic is referring to cash on hand. A couple of years ago the Federal Reserve conducted a survey that found 40% of adults said they would not be able to cover a $400 unexpected expense with cash -- they would either not be able to pay it or would do so by selling something or borrowing the money. Reality: Money spent on rent and food, or sometimes having to choose between the two doesn\\'t give you much opportunity to save a dime. \\n\\nEconomics Explained: Don\\'t live beyond your means.\\n\\nThis dude is delusional. @gia manchild master race he means, if you pay rent because you will not live with your parents because you are not a manchild then you are living beyond your means \"A\\xa0K-shaped recovery occurs when an economy recuperates unevenly, and there’s a separate trajectory for two segments of the society.\" I wonder if Economics Explained will make a video on \"How to lower the cost of living\" given our current economic climate. If everything is going up in value and wages are more or less stagnant, is there any realistically-feasible way to lower that price for consumers and still make a profit for businesses? Would be nice to know 🤔 @HauntedShadowsLegacy I didn\\'t say they were an option for all people nor did I say it isn\\'t currently practiced. My point was that the stigma of multigenerational housing in the US means that in most cases the only people who live in a house shared by multiple adult generations are the people who can\\'t afford to live on their own. If it became acceptable for adult children who have good jobs to live with their parents we would have more available housing and on average more  money available for goods and services which would reduce the costs of living in most areas by reducing housing prices and allow more money to be actively circulating in the economy. The price of strawberries is unlikely to be significantly effected by this change and is therefore not particularly relevant. @Gareth Baus Multigenerational households are already a thing in America (have been for at least the past decade), and they\\'re not the best for people from abusive households. So, nice sentiment, I guess, but a medium-sized carton of strawberries still costs seven bucks where I live. One thing that could help would be to destigmatize multigenerational households, it would reduce the demand for housing and would free up more money for other things. It wouldn\\'t solve the problem but it would help reduce the cost of living in many areas.

How may I serve ya? \"so in conclusion, you need to spend less money and live within your means. Oh hey, spend your money on our sponsor\" The rich exploiting the poor even through a crisis... Not surprised This all depends on the assumption that there IS going to be a recovery. 17:03 , yea, I\\'m already 24 going 25, and still living my parents. I do plan to move out by age 27 at the very least, cuz I think I won\\'t be able to learn to actually become an adult if I continue to live with my parents. But I gotta say, living with my parents allows me to save about 60-70% of my disposable income much of which would have gone to housing, food, water and electricity bills, transportation not to mention furniture if I lived alone, hehe. Lots of live below your means talk. Even 2 incomes(not guarenteed) can barely make any kind of lifestyle where there is work, much less the one you described. You touched on it with \"live with your parents\" like everyone also has access to living with thier parents. @Andrew Cave ah yes, low cost of living locales, where there are famously many jobs I think something needs to be done to entice and inform people about other locales to live in within the US, but that kinda sounds like a band-aid to me, because the same issues would eventually happen there.\\n\\nSomething needs to be done imo to break up all the monpolistic and oligopistic behavior the larger companies are engaging in. I feel like a lack of fair competition is a big part of why wages are stagnant.\\n\\nJust thought of something else, you remember his video on greece\\'s economy? How their currency couldn\\'t get cheaper and help correct the economy b/c it was linked to better off countries in the EU? The way the larger chains (e.g. wallmart) are all over the country, in good areas and bad, kinda feel similar to that for some reason. Not everything discussed is an option, but the main takeaway is that for some people it is and they still willingly choose not to take those options for mainly personal & cultural reasons. Those cultural differences also extend to government policy; the nations outlined in the video (namely S. Korea and Singapore) all have vastly different cultural influences in their government policy even from financially similar western nations.  Without being an expert, if EE made a video on it, I would expect you\\'d see those governments to have favorable policies towards things like taxation with regards to savings, generational housing and whatnot. sounds like you\\'d be better off in a lower cost of living locale B shaped recovery: wat Been here since 2019!

Man, that whole \"People are living beyond their means\" comment hurt.\\nCause it does feel genuinely disconnected when the system is set up so that \"Beyond your means\" is a small apartment and food security for so many people.

O-shaped recovery: The economy just returns to its exact original state every 100 years. @17:03 When you make an entire analysis of inequitable economic recoveries to justify to your parents why you still live at home Something that’s extremely scary is that in America about 70% of people are living paycheck to paycheck, which leaves them very little to no room to invest in themselves or take advantage of the coming crisis. If inflation sets in from all the QE down the road, there will be a drastic decrease in standards of living at best. Nows the time to invest in a Roth IRA. MASSIVE taxes are coming @Orange Soda So if a shark is coming for you, are you just gonna float there and do nothing or are you gonna at least swim for it?\\nJust because the corporation or whatever could be the root of a larger problem doesn\\'t mean individuals should not attempt self help and are free from blame no matter what.\\nAnd that\\'s the problem with a lot of people, they tend to put all the blame on an external entity. In reality, problems tend to be a composition of a number of components, some of which belonging to the individual. \\nNow, the composition would differ from people to people for 20% or maybe 30% of the people, it could actually be almost entirely external. But the other 40-50%, at least part of it is themselves. So while I\\'d never say something like \"they have no one to blame but themselves\", because that\\'s not true, saying that it is not at all self-inflicted would also not be true. For most of the paycheck to paycheck people, maybe the corporation handed them the knife, but they cut themselves with it. @GmaerGabe - You know nothing, Jon Snow. The Louster its only 230 million people in 7.7 billion people worldwide, look at china and India and think again It’s already started to happen...a lot of peoples are homeless now. O shaped recovery:\\nWhen nobody know is it good or bad. But because of the fear we think that there is nothing to hope for I shaped recovery: economy crashes in one afternoon and is fully back on top the next day This feels like an economist attempt at a Fire and Brimstone Sermon. \\n\\nIt makes me want to repent for my economic sins NOICE  ; )\\n\\n\\n\\n\\njajajajjajajajjajajajjajajajjjajjajajajjajajjajjaja Any person who prospers off human misery isn\\'t a \"a savy capitalist\", they\\'re just a parasite \"Live below your means and have an emergency fund\"\\n*cries in zoomer* @KuraIthys You need to adjust what basic requirements of living actually mean. Live with your parents or a lot of roommates. Even minimum wage easily covers food and housing in that case. @Maden Smith I actually think we should doing this in the US! @LarryM in comparison, it\\'s more like low-risk, low-reward. Except that the low-reward is much, much higher than what people would achieve if they keep living a financially illiterate life.\\n\\nEdit: it at least helped introduce me into the world of finance and got me motivated to stop living like the 70% of Americans who can\\'t cover a $1000 emergency. Sort of like a gateway; a starting point. Q0ET9U it’s called inflation. It eats up the value of money. It’s probably the single largest scale factor in real estate prices @Arian Behnami screw Dave Ramsey unless you are like 50k in debt. His policies are not meant for long term success just long term mediocrity after you get out of debt. \"I\" shaped recovery will result in complete disruption of the world Either we get a Huey Long or the guillotines come out. 17:06 DOTA! I know that UI anywhere. It\\'s nice and all to just say \"don\\'t live beyond your means\" but when in normal times you have to choose between food or electricity it\\'s basically impossible to not sink in debt come a downturn Not a lot of people are going to do save in large part because the wealth and opulence of the super rich is constantly on full display. It’s really hard as social creatures to not be manipulated by the desire to have status... @Arcanum okay but to get educated a lot of times you need to go into.....\\nA)debt\\nB)college\\nC) all of the above @Economics Explained Would there be an issue if a society saves too much? Government economists in my country at times have asked people to save less money. Of course people just say: \"lol, no.\"  Even with the interest rates as low as they are. @KuraIthys \\nPersonally, I wouldn\\'t mind those things, but only for practicality\\'s sake. 50 rooms gives me lots of space for a gym, pool, forge room, woodshop, painting studio, etc etc\\nAnd it\\'s important to remember that our desire for status isn\\'t some perversion of society- it\\'s a natural human instinct, and should be (healthily) fueled. It\\'s mentally gratifying to indulge in your possessions once in a while. That being said I agree, wealth for the sake of status is a dead-end in the long term. @SoapSoap But new immigrants come over and do just fine. \\nIn America you can still eat steak every week and meat daily for a grocery bill of under 50 Dollars/week.  Cars and houses are plentiful as are mansions,  so in America it\\'s up to the individual and Cost of living is still cheap. It\\'s Still as cheap as 1950.  You can still get bread for under a dollar. you can drive to any place in the USA for a vacation and it\\'s all very inexpensive. \\n\\nbut NOW, if you wanna live LARGE then you can do that too, just pay for it lol. @comment \\nNo, i meant like managers, enteroreneurs  or lawyers I\\'m starting my business this year then quitting my job. Being an employee doesn\\'t make sense 9:27 Blackstone? I know only of Blackrock! 😁 Fellow Canadians, I\\'m going all-in on XAW! The flatness of wages/salaries lends more and more credence everyday to the notion that feminism was predominantly a project of industry. It flooded the labor market with workers and the subsequent pay to those workers has been far outpaced by the cost of living.\\n\\nVery insightful video. This has been the US Economy for decades. It\\'s just happening  less gradually now. I\\'m having a gallon of ice cream recovery Economist: The economy experiences cyclical expansion and contraction. \\n\\nAerodynamicist: The economy experiences flutter modes I’m so glad I found this channel just last year, love having your insight into things. Especially now. I shaped recovery: the economy goes straight down My mom just got of debt from 2008 at the beginning of the year. All the cars we have are from before 2005 and she is fervently against owning real estate. She’s lived frugally and had the luxury of keeping a decent paying job, but still has no money saved or assets. An aversion to spending is not what an economy is supposed to create, especially those in the ‘middle class’. You will never build wealth by saving money. But you can spend yourself into poverty. It’s very one sided. @B He The problem is that those low interest rates which predate 2008 to sometime in the 90\\'s and helped subsidise wage stagnation. Any major raise now will sick the USA economy into a depression that is likely to wipe out the middle class and a massive chunk of the finance sector. The people who get to buy the massively deflated assets that go on fire sale will be the very rich who have been sitting on massive piles of cash for a decade. The is is the economic stagflation nightmare as masses of business capital moves into non-productive assets like real estate.\\n\\nThis will certainly correct things for the next generation to come but it will kill millions of people in the process. It may also threaten the USA\\'s hegemonic global power which will almost guarantee a world war regardless of which party is in power at the time. The foundation of the USA\\'s nation security capability is world domination and any threat to that is the road to war. There is nothing the USA government will not do to maintain its position at the top. Yeah, aversion to spending causes a bubble economy (I think that\\'s what its called) no spending means the market suffers and as the market suffers the people spend less which hurts the market more. \\u200b@Justin Okraski \\n There are two economies. The capital/financial economy, and the real economy where actual goods/services are exchanged and produced. Many folks believe that the real economy drives the financial and capital markets. \\n\\n In reality, it is the opposite. The Federal Reserve knows this, and they\\'ve kept rates so low for so long after 2008 that they were unable to normalize and shrink their balance sheet. We have artificially low interest rates controlled by the central banks. For the betterment of our economy, rates actually need to rise, and all of the malinvestment and mismanagement will then be allowed to be corrected. \\n\\n The scale of that correction is going to lead to business failure, job loss, and other economic extremities. But you know what? It is the bitter pill we need to swallow before we find ourselves unable to find a willing seller of real goods and services due to our extreme debts.  \\n\\r\\n\\n There are two options. Default, or inflate. The Fed will inflate. The result is higher prices and costs. Well it does sound like your mom has a sober view of her finances. She\\'s buying cars on the schedule her finances allow, rather than the what the car dealers allow. Now that she\\'s paid off debt she should be poised to build assets. Of course that\\'s not the lifestyle anyone wants to live, but she\\'s not burying her head in the sand. After struggling to get my career going after leaving college after the last recession, I\\'ve been saving heavily ever since (mild PTSD). I\\'m betting on a collapse-of-this-disgusting-system-of-capitalism recovery and an implosion of the vampire state. I feel bad for those without supportive families. I lived with my parents for a couple of extra years with a budget of maybe $3k per year total (80% of it being car related) and that was enough to get me to a point where I could get a loan for an apartment. If i lived in one of the big cities it would have had to be around 8 years of saving before i even had a chance.\\nIf you don\\'t have those safety nets, you\\'re about 10 years away of doing everything perfectly to get to where i managed to get to in 3 years. I think the correct spelling is \"Que\"\\nThe question is will it be a recovery, or recession after kicking the can down the road with huge amounts of stimulus. 16:20\\nWilling or able? Two very different things. I don\\'t think the problem is that too many Americans are living above their means in the \"good times\" due to some white picket fence ideal of American life. Most working class families people left hope of kind of life a long time ago. The problem is that most people can\\'t even afford a $400 medical emergency much less save for a rainy day. ',\n",

That\\'s the joke some dude on the bus this morning coughed and then this woman literally SWITCHED SEATS away from him That sounds like a bitch move tbh. But there’s also nothing wrong with that. There was this fucking guy who kept coughing next to me and wouldn’t cover his damn mouth. I mean the woman was being smart, especially during a pandemic ffs Clearly, the seats were not fastened down properly. All you need to do is yeet them out of the window and carry on with your day I\\'m going to start coughing on people I see hoarding a 5 year supply of toilet paper Toooo late Anyone who\\'s ever played Plague Inc knows that with most epidemics Australia will survive against all odds. \\nSort of like DiCaprio in The Revenant @nick denton same PLAGUE INC the nostalgia Thats why it started in China,start with the most populated areas @MegaVikingen \"I feel like they would know how to protect themselves.\"\\nNever under, or over, estimate Australia.\\nSee: Bondi. MegaVikingen also most of us live on the coast I don’t think Leonardo DiCaprio would go to that extent to avoid the virus \"Let me tell you, that\\'s not what you want, that\\'s bad for your health.\"\\n\\nAnd here I was thinking it was healthy.

I’m a senior though. I wouldn’t be able to graduate. I don’t want school to be shut down at all. Nooooo cuz I want to finish my exams and get em over with :((( Wolfie Editz or nonexistent. PA(my state) has a law that requires 180 days of school Jaxon: step four\\nAlso jaxon: **holds up five fingers** Meanwhile everybody in Australia panic buying toilet paper smh @hells onion SARS has a fatality rate of about 15%, whereas corona is sitting at about 3-4%. Think about population age percentages* the median age in mainland Australia is 37, with those over 85 at roughly 4-5% of the total population. The elderly and those of compromised health i.e autoimmune diseases and secondary illnesses are the ones at-risk, it\\'s important to note that this demographic is at risk from approximately everything; old age will do that to you. \\nThe coronavirus\\'s real threat is mass hysteria. Look at how quickly people have jumped on the toiletpaper and sanitiser bandwagon, with no discernible logic or practical self preservation.   According to the CDC, soap and warm water are better at preventing disease than hand sanitizer in many ways**. If we keep this dumb shit up, some seriously life threating political agendas may be triggered, I think the real threat of the corona virus is as an economic and political weapon for opportunistic greed-bois. \\n\\n*https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/1CD2B1952AFC5E7ACA257298000F2E76?OpenDocument\\n\\n**https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html @Falafel Bratan plenty of intelligence Falafel..

So last week I was at the supermarket getting my groceries when I bumped into this guy at the cookies section. He had some nice hair, nice stache, nice beard, looked all fine and dandy. He asked \"Excuse me do you know where I can get the Leonardo Di Carpio cookies\", and I replied \"No they don\\'t sell the Leonardo Di Carpio cookies here. \" \"Well that\\'s odd,\" he said, \"I\\'m pretty sure they sold those here\". Sure I knew the name \"Leonardo Di Carpio\" but not the cookies I haven\\'t. Curious, I sneaked a peek into his basket and egads: Leonardo Di Carpio shaving cream, Leonardo Di Carpio soap, Leonardo Di Carpio facial wash, Leonardo Di Carpio poultry, Leonardo Di Carpio figurines, Leonardo Di Carpio face masks. He had it all. Heck, he even had Leonardo Di Carpio vegemite!\\n\\n\\nI told him \"Yo that\\'s a lot of Leonardo Di Carpio stuff you got there\". Instantly, he gave me a confused look and said \"But this is the Leonardo Di Carpio supermarket\". In disbelief, I dashed out of the store and looked at the store sign. Staring back at me were the words \"The biggest and greatest Leonardo Di Carpio store. You want the Leonardo Di Carpio? We got the Leonardo Di Carpio\". My jaw agape, phone falling to the floor, feet rooted to the floor. This cannot be. How could I have not noticed it when I entered. That\\'s when I remembered. My Leonardo Di Carpio movie marathon from the day before, which I was unwillingly dragged into by my friend, Oiprac id odranoel (weird name I know). The sight of Leonardo Di Carpio must have been engraved into my subconscious mind. \\n\\n\\nThe same guy, worried, followed behind me and concerningly asked \"Hey, you good?\". In my state of shock, I snapped back \"This cannot be! No , this can\\'t be happening. I\\'m not going to be enticed and absorbed into the Leonardo Di Carpio universe,  just like you have! I\\'m not gonna try and pretend to be like Leonardo Di Carpio with his products, like you did, faker\". \"No\", he remarked, \"I\\'m not just a fake Leonardo Di Carpio. I\\'m THE Leonardo Di Carpio\". I took another look in my awoken state, and in that instant, I had an Inception moment. There was no mistaking it. He, was indeed, the one and only Leonardo Di Carpio.

Seek him and not man for the answers. Start with prayer,Gospel of John then more prayers and listen for the voice to your heart.

Anyway  be well ... 2.5 million stones at 3 to 5 tons each. .   They were proud to build it with smiles upon their faces. Only to decide not to draw hieroglyphs in or on it or depict it being built anywhere in all antiquities?

Relax. 1 is enough I recognize \"Bruce Almighty\" and \"A Knights Tale\". I want to know the name of the one with the witches. Anyone?????? Asterix and obelix ❤ I remember that myth about Great wall being visible in the moon crap. Even back in the day some school teachers also sharing that myth to their students. Kim Kardashian\\'s arse is clearly visible from the moon - as is Piers Morgan\\'s head @Sgt_Derpguy _25 lol what did you do? Our teacher also told us that, good thing me and my nephew rebelled against her That\\'s a tiny example of a much greater manipulation fraying at the ends. Why can\\'t I find a thousand likes of comment? I have been there, and it\\'s awesome. great wall of china. made in China. LOL That finger part cracked me up🤦😂😂 Not even the Scientists can conclusively figure out how the pyramids were built. Tom Cruise can - he\\'s one of them Scientist things, isn\\'t he? or a moron is it? By stacking stones on top of one another maybe?? I thought it was Hollywood that came up with horned helmets on the Vikings ? You lost me at “slaves didnt build the pyramids” Don’t go see the wall anytime yet 😂 Your Mind is my warehouse 😂 4:44 another lie is that a pyramid never casts a shadow on the ground 5 views\\n34 likes Timothy Reyna weird any telling. makes you wonder what else YouTube messes with... THATS WEIRD HUH Sam Rothwell. weird Biggest lie in history: \"NO U!\" If you could see the Great Wall from the Moon, you would also see every single two lane road on Earth too!! I wish that you would name the movies that you took your clips from. I don\\'t recognize the slaves building the pyramids one. It appears to be a comedy and maybe interesting. @Empress Cleo tnx Asterix and Obelix, Mission Cleopatra, enjoy 3;17 LOL Can you make a video on the biggest natural disasters happened in the history I watch this coz I saw  Stephen Chow.. ⚽ Your thumbnail is a lie... What about the Mongols from Mongolia? What if the Great Wall were stairs? 4:15 - From what Movie was #3 Pyramids & Slaves from.  Where they\\'re carrying those big blocks.  It looks like a funny comedy.  If, you know, please respond...Ty. 😂🤣😂 Its from Asterix and Obelix Meet Cleopatra, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250223/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_4 Well, you can see the great copper mine in Utah from space. It\\'s how I find my house without the address. I\\'ve seen the clay version of the Great Wall. No tourist go there... It\\'s not on any guide book.

Tqvm Asterix and Obelix Meet Cleopatra (2002) What is the name of that Egyptian movies it looks like a good comedy Btw, piltdown man was not thought to be the \"missing link\" nor a genuine find by most archeologists at the time. Just some, and all of the media. There were a number of prominent archeologists/scientists that wanted to examine the site and the finds but were not allowed. This of course raised suspicions and others continued to reserve judgement until the finds were open to general investigations. Once the materials were allowed to be actually examined carefully by real and honest archeologists/scientists it was quickly found to be a forgery. And that is why science works. Taking the word of someone is usually a good way to be hoodwinked. 2:36 this guy looks like Rasputin Rara rasputin lover of the Russian Queen IT was a shame that he carried oooooon What if he’s actually Rasputin?

Chinas wall reminds me of snake way on dragonball z KingDiaz210 that is where they got the idea from in dragon ball I dont get the hype around the Great Wall , once you find out they built it over 2300 years it is not such a wander anymore , that is 27600 months , so they built 700 meters a month , 25 meters a day , anyone can build a 25 meter long wall a day in any empire I think before many centuries moon was near the earth then now so they could see the great wall of China.

Kate Smith 😅😅😅 Coronavirus will cure all shopaholics of extensive money spending on clothes. Who needs new trends when you lack toilet paper 😉 Who’s watching during quarantine? 🙀 Why not? I am Diana Barajas we still aren’t in quarantine Thank you for keeping us distracted from everything that is going on you keep us in a good mood 😄 stay safe ❤️much love to you 🥰 Thank you for saying that!! Much love to you too❤️❤️❤️ This would be lovely if we could actually leave the house to go somewhere Four paws up for Nordstrom\\'s. They are closing all their US and Canadian stores AND paying their employees.  Cats and ethical business practices. 🥰🥰🥰 Yes, I couldn’t agree more!!! Yay! Shea posted! ❤️ need something entertaining while stuck at home during this crazy time! 😊😊 Yesss...I totally agree!!❤️ thanks,i\\'ll stick to my Corona trend:mask + loungewear😂😂😂 You can bling up your mask, a good shut in activity. with all of this time on my hands I\\'m thinking about crocheting my own top instead of buying one 🤷\\u200d♀️ great video, stay healthy and please pet your cat for me 😍 I have knitted 3scarves so far... I was just thinking this same thing Hahaha thank you Kelly!!! I laughed out loud with the cat intermission. I really wanted to adopt a Great Pyrenees and my husband wanted a cat. So we compromised and adopted a black cat. Lol. I thought I was a dog person but my cat has taught me I\\'m an animal person. I absolutely know why it\\'s called the cat walk in the fashion world now. I swear my cat would put any super model to shame. Your cat is gorgeous and I really love getting to see her/him. Um... Also I love the items you showed. Lol. I did watch all of the video. Caterina 😂😂😂😂😂 you might love this https://youtu.be/OyFA7jybuGI @Trish Pipkins We always have at least one black cat! Love them!😄 My house panther is the best. We accidentally adopted her on black cat appreciation day. We didn\\'t know that was a thing and walked into petsmart hoping they would have a black cat and they did!! Lots of them! Lol. I saw Catterina and said to my husband \"I want that one. She\\'s perfect!\" And when we got to sit with her she claimed us. She felt the same way I did. Now she sits next to me while I take calls for work and I just love her. 💖💖💖 wendy spiesman  I’ve had two black cats ...both thought they were Supermodels😁 Love that top Shea. I need to update my wardrobe! Omg but I don’t wanna spend so much money!!!! I feel like with every transition from one season to the other there are so many cute trendy things in the stores and it is so hard to resist! 😩hopefully I don’t end up broke!! Lol Denelys Garcia same... At least we\\'ll look fabulous with no money.. 😂 While I\\'m having stomachache caused by anxiety from whole this situation, uncertainty about future, my job, finance, etc, getting stuck in the house with 2 little  boys, still watch your video. The “Kitty Intermission” 😂 dying Since we\\'re stuck at home and the most dressed we\\'ll be getting is jeans and a tshirt,  how about a athleisure/ comfy clothes video with brands that actually hold up and fit well! You look gorgeous AND, my husband, Steven, was pleased you mentioned him in your video. 🤣❤️ Lol lol. My husband, too, Carol!  :) Cat moment is adorable. I died. Love it. Plz make more vdos on clothing and fashion hacks✨ Those are my favorite to make!!❤️💕 This made my entire day!! Thanks for sharing Shea! ☺️\\n... And also, I’m DYING over the kitty intervention with perfect static pose. 😹 Hahaha that cracked me up!!! Shea is just always such a beautiful, classy, lady. The type of lady I aspire to be like <3 This was the first time in my life that I spent a good chunk of money on my wardrobe all at once. I usually only buy what is necessary and spread it out over several months. Then the virus hit and I have no place to wear most of it. Luckily all the pieces will work for summer as well. I also decided to try on everything and make up different looks depending on the future occasion and then photograph each outfit. I\\'ll keep an album on my phone to refer back so when something does come up I can decide more easily. It will provide a way to keep me busy for an entire few days while also allowing me the joy of trying everything on. Great way of looking at things, Mrs. Little!  :)  There are still ways to enjoy what we bought/have - why not?!   All the best, Shannon A.  :) I don’t know if we can wear spring dresses this year 😔 we are all in quarantine @Lisa Feldmann I totally agree with you, Lisa - even if I\\'m at home, I\\'m gonna feel good about it!  I\\'ll shop and play in my own closet, wear stuff in the house that might make someone else look aghast at me, and smile all the way.  :)  There\\'s nothing wrong with wanting a bit of a different head space away from the spreading anxiety.  :)  All the best, Shannon A. Very out of touch! You can still wear dresses.  Looking nice and feeling good about yourself have not been canceled! Beverlyhillsprincess I guess she missed the memo!

My Favorite ‘20 Spring Fashion Trend is: \\n.... \\n\\nThe Kitty Intermission!! \\nThe editing with the camera flashes was perfection & brilliantly sums up my when my own cat walks into the room ‘stop what you’re doing it’s all about me now/Meow’  what a beautiful Kitty he’s most definitely the perfect fashion accessory & by that I mean even if you consistently lint roll your clothing there will inevitably always be a bit of fur on your clothes 😻😻🙀😸... \\n\\nMy 2nd Fave is the square toe KITTEN heels (lol) but seriously so happy they’re a trend again, they’re so Cute, Comfortable, & dainty. Love the wide-leg pants and jeans. Of course, at age 61, I have worn this style several times over the years as fashion styles come & go, again & again.i  definitely think you need to wear a shirt that is more tailored or fitted, to show your shape. Wearing tops that are more flow-y or loose with wide leg pants will make even the most toned or thin person look ‘big.’ Thanks for the upbeat videos Shae! You have good advice & instincts and I truly appreciate your positive attitude. ♥️♥️ Vintage floral = yes please! Light, wide-leg denim = pass. Love you Shea!!!! So funny how we can look at these trends differently, but with an appreciation. Thanks for the fun reply!!  You stay well, too!! 🥰 Marissa Grilli ha! That’s funny cuz I am the complete opposite! Vintage floral pass for me and wide leg jeans yes please!! Maybe cuz I’m 6ft and always loved a great flowy or wide leg pant. Stay well!! :) How are we going to wear these outfits if we\\'re in quarantine during spring time...hopefully we are clear for the summer 😔💔 Shea what’s your cats name it’s adorable awww Looking nice and feeling good about yourself have not been canceled!

       " 'When the trail is finished you should time every youtuber who rides it and make a score board like top gear 2 competitions, one competition for mountainbike youtubers on a cheap bike and one competition for \"regular\" youtubers on a \"regular\" mountainbike. I think a calibre bossnut would be best bike... full suspension £1000... makes sense since there is no way many people will willingly ride a hardtail through there. Любослав Николов bg? The scope of my engineering genius literally knows no bounds. Smartest man a live Just remember this guy still hasn’t even touched the down half of his yard im from the future he\\'ll build a boring gravel road He has. Barely 😂😂 @Wyatt Hunt So much potential left! @Sam Gee Yea it\\'s going to be so sick I thought he said 5 acres at some point. Seems bigger than that. Next episode: How I programmed the Gator so it can drive back autonomously. Funny you say that, some gator models are equipped with John Deere’s tractor Autosteer. I’ve actually ran one that steer’s itself. Seth...... ya gotta do it!!,!,!!,!,!! LoL I could help with that The funniest part about this video is that he crawled under his desk and into a little box to record the voice over @Robert Siler I don\\'t remember asking There\\'s a garage tour that shows that Lmao theres a video where he made that \\'So what did you do during lockdown?\\'\\n\\'I watched a guy organise some wooden planks\\' @Dylan Bikes & Things Yeah lets go climb absurdly steep hills wearing lycra like a dork, how fuckin unfun that, bmx trails are pure art pieces you derolicts mountain bike trails are beaten down so bad even going on horseback would be a chore. Bike riding is meant to be fun not excruciating\\nOh and i dont fancy selling my organs to the highest bidder just to be able to get an intermediate level bike 😂 S H shut up @S H where did that come from lmaoo It’s a joke calm down @S H Have you ever tried to ride a BMX on a mountain bike trail? It\\'s not easy. Plus, while BMX are more pure, mountain bike TRAILS are much more pure than BMX trails Seth: Builds a shuttle trail for his at-home bike park\\nSeth 10 years from now: Building a Ski lift out of dead trees and the gator winch up to Mt. Drama XD Mt Oscar*** Mt drama, i like it! He would honor drama RJAY - He’s talked about a future project of opening a public bike park in at least one previous video that I can think of. That could be the most efficient way of pulling that off. Most of the infrastructure would already be there definitely a cool idea. Name it “Alligator Alley” since it’s literally used for a Gator 😂 I’m in Florida also and didn’t realize so many people would pick up on on why I picked Alligator Alley. You guys are sharp, well done. 👍🏽👍🏽 Like so he can see thins guys I love this! Perfect for his FL roots That represents your channel\\'s sfl roots! I second! I just realized I enjoyed watching a video of a man raking in the woods. Seth: I hope you enjoyed this even though it was a little boring.\\n\\nMe: Enjoys all Seth’s Bike Hacks and Berm Peak Express vids... His story telling is great, regardless of the topic Anyone notice that Alex’s van was parked there Corona baby when I started watching seth he was squeezing a million bikes into a closet, now hes shuttling laps in his backyard 😮 I love the journey! Seth has stayed Seth through it all oh those Florida days were so chillaxing ngl i was the 1000th like O and #11 on trending! fred11 ya I always look forward to his videos When doing your “yank” or any pull for that matter, put a blanket over the top of your sling, chain, or wire rope.  This will keep it from flying up and back and putting you in the HOSPITAL.  This is a common practice used in industrial pulls. Nobody:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlightReacts when he sees it\\'s called the flight deck: look at Seth man, so inspirational LoL It be like that Lmaoooo bro I really love how he always says “we”. Never “I”. It gives this channel a very inclusive and nice feeling. 5:18\\nGuys! It\\'s the male Froggy-Seth performing his natural mating ritual! This has only been captured on camera on a handful of occasions! Wow. Berm peaks trail head gets an upgrade \\n\\nMe:you installed a ski lift Same Don\\'t give him ideas Haha, that\\'s very true. Seth: \"i used the lumber to hold the lumber\" Seth : let’s build a shuttle road        Me: I can’t even fit one jump in my garden  🤘🤘🤙 I feel like there is a distinct lack of berms developing at “Berm Peak.” Seth in 9 months: \"Installing My second lift at Berm Peak!\" When I started watching Seth, he was riding fat bikes into oceans, now he has a bike park. @Knice Knafs Damn that means since you posted this comment he\\'s gained 100k subs. In one month. YO_TENGO same He has a trigger finger hahahah same LoL same😂 I am loving these videos! You should build a fireplace out there or a fire pit Seth: gives the trailhead an upgrade\\nAlso Seth: Realizes he accidentally build a whole ski lift\\n*suprised pikachu face* Next: building a pizza oven under the flight deck to feed my whole neighbourhood when they come to shred 2:45 When Seth forgets which way is backwards I like how nobody shows up until it’s time to ride🤣 33 on trending! Congrats, that\\'s a lot for someone who just organized his wood \"Giving it a good stare.\"  Good way of putting it.

So are so freaking smart where the hell you get those ideas? \\n\\nThat’s why I order my BP shirt yesterday 😝 \\nI wish you make one with drama and Oscar soon 5:17 \"what\\'s it\\'s wait capacity?\" \"At least one Seth\" I love how this channel has turned into an amazing progress of land management and mountain biking!  It makes me want to watch the channel more and more  just as McFarland  and his freedom factory! I can see it now, \"Berm Peak Resort\". Seth I dare you to instal a little chairlift . Put a fire pit at the trailhead! That would be awesome. i love the home park and wish i could build my own to Seth: “the design was not complicated at all” Us: how do we build that! 10 years later\\n\\nSeth\\'s friend: wanna go trailing?\\n\\nSeth: nah I have my own mountain. xBUBBYGAMINGx I know right Don’t tell ProAwesome 22...... he’s too young😭 And social distancing ProAwesome 22 you dont get it do you... Major Roberts so what Seth: “the design was not complicated at all” Us: how do we build that! Who else feeels like he has done nothing with the airbag since built Flynn Lilly he didn’t want to use it during winter cause it would damage the lawn and get wet I miss how your old video were about other stuff like different bikes, trips places, bmx, tutorials, different places and unique video topics like, underground cave bike parks, unicycling and tall fat bikes, stuff like that, now it’s just your backyard trails. I understand a lot of people are going to disagree but watching your old videos from a few years ago just seem so much more adventurous and magical. Love how he says \"we\" and \"we\\'ll\" as though he\\'s refering to the audience and him building the trail! 😂 I have no idea how im so addicted to Seth\\'s videos, i dont even own a bike or even have a money to buy 1, still watching your videos are so damn relaxing and actually makes me dream at night about riding/building trails like these. Keep up the good work man! Seth: I Upgraded the flight deck\\nMe: i got new brakes \"Giving it a good stare.\" Good way of putting it. My wife won\\'t go to home depot with me because of \"the stare\" hes using an old school Miami 90s club hit at his montage music. Always a highlight to a boring quarantine day! Stan Gorse same here Seth : let’s build a shuttle road Me: I can’t even fit one jump in my garden 🤘🤘🤙 Seth- The whole world is on lockdown\\n**Gives friend high five** 5:18 Guys! It\\'s the male Froggy-Seth performing his natural mating ritual! This has only been captured on camera on a handful of occasions! Wow. i started watching seth when he was doing how to\\'s in the city and now he\\'s building gator trails and doing shuttled laps. so glad I subbed at 15k Any body \\nelse think that Seth is still so under rated he should have at least 8 mil Honestly its good as a builder channel and im sure he will start riding again after this corona is gone Al Morris exactly Yeah and his voice alone is so therapeutic Agreed he’s actually putting wicked informative interesting and exciting content !!! Tucker I wish that to high of a number not everyone is interested in mountain biking 2 years ago I was watching this channel and I was riding a entry level hard tail now I’m riding a 3 thousand dollar full suspension Who said YouTube is free?

One suggestion though: you should reinforce the section of the airbag trail that crosses with the new road, so as not to ruin it too much when going over it with the gator time and time again When this c*rona things done can i pay you to do this stuff on my property? I have like 100ft of elevation difference and everything to shuttle bikes but im not a great trail builder😂 Hey seth. I\\'d like to see some pov footage of all the trails features etc. Weve actually only really seen airbag once.

Communication happens between the sender and the receiver. How it is perceived depends a lot on the horizon of the person reading it. Paintings have more dimensions, as they use several methods of communication (words can do that too, but it rarely happens in longer texts as it is difficult to maintain the coherence necessary for a longer work, but poems can use words and letters in many different ways), so it gets even more difficult to read them. Im no connoisseur of art, but your animations never cease to amaze. \\nMost YouTube animators and content creators have a fixed style they call their own. They also focus on a particular genre, in which they specialize in. However Ted-Ed is different. The animation varies wildly, and i believe it\\'s fitting for the motto of the channel. in this video you will find the answer:  Definitons of art / film art assignment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpaVljGhAc *Corns-aren\\'t-sour Connoisseur* Connosorry Not sure the word \"connesuir\" exists.

Enjoy! Please share Please share the link \"Do wee need a creator to be able to appreciate the creations?\" Wow sounds like a profound theosophical question. As someone who draws stuff, I like it when people tell me about their interpretations, this inspires me to create better drawings. Who else spotted Trump? Shhhhhh that is innecesary to say here nashatbi  I did but I felt like it was an unnecessary jab towards him for a video like this. _Arts meaning is at the individuals interpretation._ I love sharing my interpretations with my friends and hear theirs, so i\\'m definetly don\\'t think that a painting or an art object can have only one and only interpretation. It would be so boring and i don\\'t think that art wants to be that. My quick answer before watching the video:\\n\\nEvery individual observer decides what art means to them...\\n\\n(Edit:) ...After watching the video I maintain my opinion. All interpretations are valid regardless of artist intent. \\nIs it wrong for me to stand on a chair or sit cross-legged just because the chair manufacturer only intended it as a seat?\\nIf I use the chair as a doorstop am I invalidating it? ...lol\\n\\nCreativity inspires creativity. That\\'s the beauty of expression: it leads to more and more novelty (i.e. memes about memes lol). It doesn\\'t matter in what direction an artwork inspires, in my opinion. All that matters is that it inspired. It serves a purpose even if that\\'s unintended. That\\'s a well written response, I agree with you in this video you will find the answer:  Definitons of art / film art assignment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpaVljGhAc I think that the artist meaning does change the feeling towards the painting for better or worse, so in all I believe artist should not put a meaning towards the painting but just let everyone have their moment of feeling with it Why do I feel so restless and unsatisfied after watthis particular video? 🤔 in this video you will find the answer:  Definitons of art / film art assignment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpaVljGhAc Samved Vyas because the title of the video was a question that wasn’t answered directly. Instead, the narrator explained why this question is debatable and remains unanswered. When your so early you dont know what to say kitty donut same :) This is why I LIVE MY LIFE by \"The Death of The Auther,\" the creator doesn\\'t decide on what it means, you do. I think, art means \\r\\n\"the things that converted from imaginations into the reality.\"\\r\\n\"it pierces through the true nature whatever it is.\" 1:03 \"Red Bull gives you wings!\" *A TurE ArT iS a EXplOsioN* Katsu I think it\\'d be cool if the artists\\' intentions and my interpretation were the same. After all we always liked those who understand us and I think that\\'s what we want when we see someone\\'s artwork. 4:02           \\n All of a sudden, the man starts floating in the air\\nThen goes into the painting Who decides? Escanor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPraise the sun yall bruh I hope this is a reference to what I think it is. I really appreciate how the chef tossed that cupcake on the client\\'s face😂 deidara has decided that before\\n\"art is an explosion\" deidara has decided that before\\n\"art is an explosion\" deidara has decided that before\\n\"art is an explosion\" art has different interpretations from different interpreters, but when you find analogies between those interpretations that\\'s what makes an art a great one. Art is TED-ED ❤❤ Art is subjective. That is why last year I saw a painting sold for USD 2.5 million which was nothing but a white canvas with a single red line running diagonally across the whole canvas.\\nI bet the creator of the painting must be laughing dead after the auction. \\nBut hey that is what art is now a days.\\nBeauty really lies in the eye of the beholder. in this video you will find the answer:  Definitons of art / film art assignment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpaVljGhAc Perfect timing I have to learn about art ahhhhh life\\'s easy If I painted something and I had my own intention; my own message to portray then that is what I want other people to know. Yes, I would like to hear what they think it is but I don\\'t want them to be spreading around their beliefs as \\'gospel truth\\' or arguing over their interpretations of the piece. I WANT MY INTENTION TO BE KNOWN BECAUSE THAT\\'S WHY I PAINTED IT :)\\n\\n\\nEdit: Gorgeous animation btw. Also, at 2:14 is that pollutant Trump? If you give a 3 year old some crayon and ask her to draw something and place that picture in an Art Museum\\n\\nPeople will Actually Believe it\\'s a Work of Art 😂 I actually wrote a short story about that hypothetical case some years ago. in this video you will find the answer:  Definitons of art / film art assignment  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtpaVljGhAc Is it not?\\nI would argue it\\'s more a genuine and worthwhile of an artwork than many grand and expensive oil paintings made some centuries ago. Your animation is art at its finest. Love it! The sound of that pudding across that women\\'s face !!! I\\'m dying at work ! Lol Whoa! 2:14--Trump as a \"pollutant\". (Just an \"interpretation\", right?) @latinoheat300 lmao I interpreted it as Trump working tirelessly to remove the pollutants (ie the dots), a very brave choice by the artist in these highly polarised times. @Bence Illes Their agenda is to inform us, not to show political opinion. You just interpret a man with blonde hair as Trump. @Bence Illes I bet you\\'re one of those making fun of Moslems who freak out when someone draws a picture of Mohammed. But if someone draws a picture of some blond guy that could possibly be supposed to look a bit like Trump you reject that as \"political\".\\n\\nIn this regard Trump is really different from any former president of the US: he\\'s the very first one you can\\'t even show a picture of (not to mention making fun of) without someone blaming you for doing so. I was about to comment that Who decide it ? Escanor ofcourse \\nPraise the sun ☀️ If this is how \"the proof is in the pudding\" came to be, I am thoroughly impressed. 1:58 are you sure that\\'s pudding and not something else? This is beautiful, like art is, everything is beautiful, everything is art ❤️ This channel is art itself that gives the universe meaning!!! I just came here to de-stress from some homework I was having trouble with. Thanks for this. Next time, open with \"it will never ever have a definitive answer\" please. TBH I would feel happy after GOOGLING it! First to put this out their, I have been an artist for over ten years, because of this I have noticed many things about my art, and how it changes meaning over time. A few years back, I did an artwork of a character standing next to a tree. The artwork was created to represent how life continues, even if everything around us seems to wither. However, someone wanted a copy of it, because of how much they liked it, we conversed on the subject and I gave them a copy. A few months later, we became friends, and since then, each year I would draw an artwork of that same character to honor our friendship. \\n\\nSo despite the artist\\'s original intent, the meaning can change over time in the minds of others or the artist. My personal thought on the question, is that the original intended meaning created by the artist, stays permanently on the artwork in some way or form; but  viewers and critiques add their own meaning based on what it conveys to them personally, like how different countries have separate meanings for the symbolism of the same thing. Personally, the first goal of art is to get a reaction out of you- any reaction The animation is so funny and attractive 😂❤ wow at the end you always say something positive, like someday we\\'ll know the answer\\nnot here if i were a painter, i would be glad if the interpretations of my work are different in one person from another As an artist myself🎭🖼🎨, the intention of my work vs. the way it\\'s interpreted is something that often comes to mind. I\\'m a \"middle ground\" person myself. Me and my mom has this exact argument over a picture I drew. I\\'ve enjoyed songs less after I\\'ve found their true meaning. \"The Artist does.\" - The Artist\\n\\nBut with that being said, the artist can KNOW what it means, but the wonderful thing about art is its objective subjectivity. As an artist I love other peoples interpretations of my creations. I\\'m an artist myself and I like to leave my artworks open to interpretation Liked before watching, I\\'ve been asking this with regards to music. You decide. I believe it’s all up to interpretation, and how a work speaks to you in particular. Imagine you and your friend are walking through an art gallery and suddenly you see pair of glasses on the ground. Both of you are wondering if it\\'s an art exhibit or if someone just dropped them. I love the animation on this video.  And it was really interesting, thank you :) This was amazing. Thank you for the continuous stunning works Art is like life, you have to find your own meaning for it. Anyone know the name of this style of drawn animation? Love the style! \"The pudding is working\"\\nYeah \"pudding\" totally. EXACTLY TED!! Who?? 1:54 for the people who want to see ‘pudding to face’ again One of the biggest influences of my life was when I was yet a kid, like 13-14 or so, when I stumbled across the essay by Roland Barthes \"The Death of The Author\". I honestly believe one should separate author\\'s identity and supposed intention behind the work from the work itself as framing imposes a limit of interpretation. We should be able to interpret art, whether it\\'s picture, sculpture or a text, however we want and author\\'s interpretation is just one of very many possible. After that, it\\'s up to the viewing audience to decide what it means to them ( art ) and how well it conveys whatever they think is the message. \\nGreat Valuable Video I decide, you decide, and you decide! waouts LoLff love love love human art In my opinion, the author\\'s interpretation is THE interpretation, and the one that gives the piece meaning, because preceded it\\'s creation, and not the other way around; however, any individual can have a singular interpretation of the piece of art, but this would be in a lower category than the author\\'s. @NK wow I didn\\'t even realise English isn\\'t your second language.... You sound really fluent :) @Aadithya Hrudhay Well, arguing about art is certainly useless, but is good for practising my English for free. @NK Hey, while you make a lot of sense, why compare in the first place? Art, at the end of the day, is for one to enjoy right, so I think this debate isn\\'t even like useful. I can choose to interpret art in any way I can, and nobody can stop me (unless the big brother sends his thought police :) Plus, I think artists will be honoured at different interpretations which they never thought of themselves. \\u200b@Aadithya Hrudhay I would say that relative to personal reason, someone can place own interpretation of art work higher than that of an artist. But relative to the fact that artist has already had, at least some idea what piece of art should represent, when it was in creation, artist\\'s interpretation should be placed higher. So probably, at the end it all comes down to \"relative to what\" question, since we don\\'t have an absolute truth, by which we could judge some artistic work. Unless author was just doing something random, without putting much thought into it, and only latter, when the work was already finished, made it\\'s own interpretation.Then I would say that your interpretation of artist\\'s work is as good as any, even that of an artist itself. Ok suppose there was a certain incident that happened in your life of deep emotional significance, and a piece of art represents, captures or reminds you of that incident. Then, what if it means more to you than what it meant to maybe even the artist? Will you rob somebody the chance to enjoy this art on a whole new different level with such a sweeping, mechanical statement? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, although the artist\\'s intention can offer interesting insight. It\\'s highly situational and relative, so we can\\'t generalize. I miss the old outro with the kind of reversed music. I miss the old outro with the kind of reversed music. 2:14 THE SHADE!!!!! I CAN\\'T!!! What I see in the paintings is beauty but not to touch or keep but just to see, or something like that 3:15 i want that shirt If the animation in this TED-Ed video is art, then who decides what that animation means?? I thought you\\'re going to try to explain what is and what isn\\'t art.\\nWhat make art \\'art\\'. \\nBut this was great too.\\nAlso,the animation style is so beautiful 🧡 😖😖😖\\nIn my GRE exam one  long passage was about artist, their mind, our minds etc. I suffer from that trauma 😭😭😭\\n\\nEven Ted-ed💜  could help; that narration is so 👎👎👎 3:12 thats Steve Jobs, dude. Oddly enough,  the same can be said for music (in a way). How did the composer want this piece to be interpreted. (Depending on the piece or composer, many answers are right)\\nGreat job Ted-Ed Religious interpretation of long lost authors can have profound consequences. Should believers embrace or reject slavery, genocide, present social morays, traditional beliefs, creation descriptions, etc.. Does the author\\'s intent only matter, or the interpreter, and which interpreter? Are the original reasons still relevant? The animations is so cute :0 0:00\\nOnly you. \\nIf youre the artist and you wish to explain how you interpret your own piece then do so.\\nIf not, then depending on how you present your work, you shouldn\\'t be upset if people assume things that otherwise aren\\'t the case in your view are entirely your fault.\\nHowever, people interpreting things for their own view sometimes helps them see things no one else can explain to them.\\n\\nMy personal opinion ~\\n:I loved the video <3 I interpret art and everything based on how it relates to me. I love the voice of the one speaking this video is misguided. i was waiting for ambiguity. such a sad attempt to communicate a truth. and the art shown is not even worth an afternoon\\'s tea. damn I need that Tshirt Never thought of this question \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now I want to know Art is a conversation between artist and viewer,  I think.  So, I guess I\\'m a \\'middle-grounder\\'. Am I the only one thinking that the guy playing with the sand in 3:01 is sooo satisfying? TED Ed is how i pass my exams Those animations were just spectacular. Mind-blown!! I believe the artist\\'s (painter, author, musician, etc.) intention is important due to the fact that the insights gained from some works of art have lead to action being taken. Sometimes positive, and sometimes negative, but regardless, the negative can be mitigated if the artist\\'s intentions are known (for most works of art). I also personally hated having to interpret what a dead author meant by his/her book and being judged on my interpretation.\\n\\nHowever, I believe you should be able to enjoy the artist\\'s work before knowing their intent, sit on it a while to see what your subconscious gains from these insights and once solidified, learn of the artist\\'s intent. This allows you to get personal insight into yourself, learning more about yourself, and then still potentially absorbing the intent the artist sought to portray. Exactly...the only comment which covers both of the important points I really enjoyed this♡ TED-Ed\\'s animation is getting cuter. I can\\'t . I would say that a artist fails if the art is misinterpreted ',\n",

China will destroy you trash. We managed pretty well without China for 200 years. @Mark Spin \\nSickening in at least 2 definitions of the word Sit outside the airport, someone tries to leave you detain them your own way, if theres a massive outbreak in the area where the plane landed atleast we will know the government let them wander aswell all dont like china Corey must be sent back with the wuhan plane RUDEBROTHERS Disgusting racist rubbish go to hell!  China will destroy you trash. They should send all the politicians in the pay of the CCP to China on the plane Corey is a spy 😂 There\\'s something obvious going on with the guy. The Chinese govt owns Corey! Corey showing his true colours. ---------- A f*cking snake if there ever was one. You are kidding, just as we are flattening the curve, they let THIS BACK IN?? WHO ALLOWED THIS! Lord Sandwich Disgusting racist rubbish go to hell!  China will destroy you trash. Lord Sandwich Thanks so much for support Australia, Wuhan is hero and epic. Please stay safe while landing Sydney, because Sydney has more than 1000 existing cases which is much more dangerous than Wuhan with only 3 hundreds existing cases. This medical equipment must be fantastic, this is the reason why wuhan could put the virus under control so fast. Thanks for supporting us. China and Australia are Brother. Who allowed it.. That cory drongo... Claiming how they would be locked down. Just like the ruby princess right? Lord Sandwich take a wild guess! @Tammy. Yahushua is Lord and King .Right Australia should work with Taiwan, not CCP. This flight is a slap in the face to Australia \\nGood old Pauline fighting for common sense \\nOnce again 👍 Disgusting racist rubbish go to hell!  China will destroy you trash. Problem is theres not enough common sense in australia to get her in where we need her I have to stay home and they allow flights from China, where the virus came from.  Medical supplies, the chinese took our medical supplies. Joke. Corry you\\'re a joke. Calan MacLeod Disgusting racist rubbish go to hell!  China will destroy you trash. I\\'m no Aussie, can someone tell me why the f Australia allow the Chinese to utterly strip the country? First the properties, then the baby milk, medical supplies and now they\\'re allowed to land a plane in your country when if the reverse were to happen in China, the Chinese would mob the airport and take bats to the pilot. This is a BETRAYAL  of EVERYTHING you have put is through, the loss of our businesses and homes. AND NONE OF YOU KNOW WHAT\"S IN THAT PLANE??  I CANT BELIEVE THIS!!@ Lord Sandwich You can be sure the government knows what’s in the plane.  None of these people are members of the government so the fact they don’t know what’s in the plane is meaningless.  Peter Dutton is the man in the government that Corey was referring to who is the person to ask if you really want to know what’s in the plane. However I agree the optics on this plane coming in at this point in time are very bad. The government needs to announce very soon what this plane is bringing and why it’s being allowed in. Properly another some more CCP Virus. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-9XHqpONGI We need them to post the manifest on youtube before they get it unloaded. LMAO So a reporter, an ex politician and a current senator didn\\'t get the worldwide memo on what is on a plane. Shocking. \\nPauline is probably the only one with the power to find out. I bet she\\'s onto it though. Hopefully people using zoom app watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avg5HRLwkHo Pauline.  The answer is NO!  Hell NO!  The plane should not even be allowed to enter Australia airspace. NO! lisa feck Disgusting racist rubbish go to hell!  China will destroy you trash.

YOU MEAN NONE OF YOU KNOW WHAT\"S IN IT??? FFS! IS ANYONE AWAKE IN THIS GOVERNMENT??? They are perfectly aware of what\\'s inside. It\\'s medical supplies for Australia. And that\\'s exactly why they say they don\\'t know. Do you see the problem here? I hope you can have a think about it. Lord Sandwich None of these people are members of the government @lorita Kumar 99% of those people are running on NEED TO KNOW BASIS ONLY\\nOnly the KEY POSITIONS of power are corrupted not the entire 1% The government is awake. The people in it are just not using their brains. What else can I say? They seem a to be a bit daft to be honest. I fear it\\'s not COVID-19 but a new virus entirely or a MUTATED version of COVID-19\\nThis doesn\\'t add up , i want to know what that special cargo is\\nImagen what they can demand with a 2nd virus in circulation CCP medical supplies are faulty and tainted anyway.\\n\\nWe don\\'t need them @Eric KM  I watched this video, it seems that the guy who uploaded this video failed to get enough education.

This is bad judgment, whatever the reason. I fear they won\\'t learn anything from this. Cory is a muppet , And here I thought America\\'s government  were knitwits.  Australia take the crown @Hawi Jack you\\'re full of crap. All you leftys were calling him a racist for stopping flights. Nancy Pelosi is on video urging people to come to a packed China town parade in March. First you claim he\\'s over reacting then you claim he didn\\'t react fast enough. You\\'re hypocrites and it\\'s all on video. This is why you\\'re nominating a guy with dementia to run against him. You can\\'t make proper decisions bc you\\'re blinded by hate. Good luck in Nov, lol, you\\'re going to get crushed bc so many more of us have seen through the lies. Canada and our lefty minister beats both USA and Australia . We still have air planes comming to canada from china with People ,not cargo . As an American I can attest that yes our government is run by a narcissist sociopath president who is definitely a nitwit.\\nTrump knew about this months ago but didn’t have empathy for those who would die, to him they are just surplus population. What makes you think our leaders are nitwits? Werent we the first to ban travel? We\\'ve been taking on the Chinese for their predatory trade practices and now their incompetence in unleashing this virus on the world? This is mere speculation at this point. The plane may be delivering much needed supplies and the crew may be sent directly to a hotel for their return journey. We really have to stop jumping the gun in mass hysteria BEFORE we learn the facts. THEY ARE IMPORTING A NEW VERSION OF THE VIRUS.\\nENJOY 10 x worse That\\'s true. It is no secret they sacrifice some of their own to spread this manufactured virus. Any one in china who hints at what is going on suddenly disappear. How can Aussie government stoop so low? Paid again? UTT : Under Table Transaction Pawan Kumar yes money coming in to Aus from China for us to promote them as the hero\\'s!

Answerable to China not Australians. @Victor Victor yes probably, but faulty medical supplies, really...? It\\'s probably a few metric tonnes of virus concentrate @Kevin Brown Let me tell you what’s on it. It carries tons of medical goods your gov begged from China.

It\\'s like throwing a grenade in a crowded Room . after all the calling out for boycotting china for many many weeks, but it looks like the aussie democratic goverment cannot wait any longer to restart doing business with the chinese communist dictators. any thought? @Mike Liu , this country has unfortunately become to independent on the Chinese market, and all levels of politics are so corrupted, and have been for so long, hence why every government that comes in to power here , all going running off, selling the workers who do the hard hard, so people can line there pockets, people unfortunately have learnt to live out side there means, and now it has just shown, the true colours , of how de rooted the CCP is here, and now you have this footage, https://youtu.be/OMqviRYC24c, kicking around and other countries returning medical supplies back to China as they are faulty, if you go to WION new , they had a good article , about billionaires, and Just happens that China’s medical industry has boomed from this, Pam Terry it is all about money, mate, who hates money? china has got single biggest consumer market for australian exports....meat, seafood, clayfish, timbers, all kind of raw materials...billion and billion dollars deals...u would hope aussie goverment is going to say no to that? china is the only economic superpower where has come out of lockdown and needing to trade...no way the aussie goverment is going to turn them away Hang the bloody lot of them in the Chinese government!!! we dont have mainstream media like this in Sweden. we would be stoned to death for this. thank you australia sky news I like ABBA 😁 REBEL SWEDISH people , we will REBEL too throughout EUROPE!\\nLet\\'s pick a date GLOBALLY and go to parlament in MASSIVE NUMBERS all over the world @ once\\nV for Vendetta style Pauline is the only true Australian in this Government, the rest are Chinese “bum boys”. Benardi is Benardi and this is exactly why he went nowhere failing completely in his political journey. Bravo Pauline !

Here how it got infected! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-9XHqpONGI It’s here to pick up the last of our baby formula, medicines and PPE to take back to China.  This is it folks, nothing will ever change, the politicians, including Bernardi, will continue to enslave Australians to China.  Bernardi showing his true globalist colours.\\n\\nThe Australian government is giving priority to China’s economy while hanging us all out to dry. your gov\\'t is fookin insane. they are most definitely   on the chicom payroll @col I wish President Trump could help us in Australia mate, but he can\\'t. :( MATTHEW GIBBS  China playing scapegoat. when nothing is done then you will know they are all in on it MATTHEW GIBBS beggars belief. I\\'m writing to president Trump MATTHEW GIBBS it\\'s probably test kits or something similar. Until we can make them ourselves we are stuck getting crap from them. I don\\'t know if the products are trustworthy though. This is madness ! Why is there still no action being taken ?  Why are we all just forced to sit and watch? @Ryan Zhang Please watch objective news. DW News is ccp sponsored.    Unless of course you don\\'t have access and only see what the chinese communist party want you to see. @Ryan Zhang hahahaha We don\\'t have evidence saying they are not.  We do have evidence of ccp greed and corruption.  Be realistic man. @Jason Kidney S well we don\\'t have evidence saying they are selling those back at higher price @Ryan Zhang So the ccp pillage our medical supplies and sell them back to us at a higher price......  Well that\\'s typical. ABC news: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-08/wuhan-flight-lands-sydney-medical-equipment-coronavirus-covid19/12135016 Prime seafood exports to Hong Kong and China whilst we eat rubbish fish. You got that right, Mate! @太守苏定交趾 Well China\\'s so full of shit they\\'re gonna need it 🤣 Edward Turner Don’t worry Pauline,the aircraft is here just to get some toilet paper and will fly back to Wuhan very soon The plane crew needs to be tested and put in 2 weeks quarantine like the rest of the people. Thats it, get China\\'s economy going again......WTF. blue dog am I crying ? Nah I’m having a good laugh I called you out for the idiot you are @vzdorr b Are you still crying? blue dog ah the traitor shows his true form, you realise illuminating a ship or aircraft with a weapons control radar isn’t monitoring it’s a hostile act, China has threaten Australia multiple times they’ve made artificial islands south of their country and bully their neighbours , China isn’t an emerging super power none of their technology is proven and their military hasn’t won any recent conflicts they in fact invaded Vietnam in the late 70s and were humiliated, you realise you won’t be able to “adapt” unless of course you’re Han Chinese if you’re not you’re in trouble, if Australia doesn’t defend itself it’ll end up like Tibet @vzdorr b So? Everybody monitors everybody. They haven\\'t displayed open physical hostility toward us. China will be the next leading superpower, and that is just a fact. I have chosen to adapt and prosper. Sorry you aren\\'t doing well. blue dog I like the assumptions you made but you failed to answer why China is in a free trade agreement with Australia yet doesn’t allow free trade for Australians, you seem to have no issues with Australian assists being sold off to a foreign communist government. China has positioned its military around Australian there’s a Chinese logistics base in Fiji and a extension in Vanuatu, China frequently sends PICs to monitor Australia’s surface fleet especially during naval exercises, China flies large fixed wing aircraft from mainland China to Chinese owned airports in western and south Australia ‘wings clean’ , in 2011 when United States and Australia wanted to increase the marine contingency in Darwin China threatened economic actions against Australia same thing happened when a carrier supporting wharf was proposed for HMAS Stirling, when Australia visits ally nations such as Vietnam ,Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, japan and South Korea they are always shadowed by Chinese frigates and destroyers and Chinese are always illuminating Australian warships and aircraft with weapons control radars which is a hostile intention. So again you’re either a traitor or CCP shill They shouldn\\'t be allowing goods from China. @Edward Young In your mind, anybody holds different views from you is communist. Pathetic, two-dimensional species. @Edward Young Stop a genocide by killing? What a fxxking joke. But, not surprising, considering you are brainwashed all the time. Look at those examples you mentioned, do you really know the facts of all those things? No, you just eat whatever shit from the anti-China media without thinking. Simple example, social credit system, what’s it for? How does it work? SCS is to restrict the deadbeats from high consumption as most of deadbeats were businessmen and they hide their wealth before bankrupts. I’m curious why you are so fxxking addicted in collecting those small things from China and twisting the truths but ignoring facts of mass killings and destroying of independent countries from your daddy US. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in others’ eye but pay no attention to the plank in your own eye, hypocrite? Your every finger is covered with blood yet you point fingers at others. What the fxxking species are you? Pauline Hanson should be running australia said it years ago all the stick she has been through still going strong what a lady keep on keeping on a dear lady. We were warned years ago. People never want to upset the foreigners for fear of being called racists. Of course we can be discrimated against - that seems acceptable. They don\\'t even know what is on this plane. FOOLS. paddy brady the new Iron Lady. CCP must be held accountable for their actions. Good grief where is the common sense ! Our beautiful neighbor, Australia. Be vigilant. Act fast. Hold the bloody CCP fully accountable for all the damages it has caused to your country. Wake up, Mates! I like what you said. CCP must be held accountable for their actions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-9XHqpONGI NO. WHY? NO WAY!

Don’t worry Pauline,the aircraft is here just to get some toilet paper and will fly back to Wuhan very soon.

This is irresponsible and NO flight from China should be allowed in for the next 12 months at least 😡 laurie gaston tell me why??? laurie gaston  ok then the only option left would be for every country who has deaths from the Coronavirus to top it off as shit happens and continue to allow them to get away with it without consequence in which case if nothing gets done now  nothing will happen later on @lol 993 I think now is not the time to pick fights with China laurie gaston I think everyone has an open mind but China failed at soo many levels same with the who there are reports that this could of been contained up to 95% if they had been honest from the start and asked for help rather then do a cover up and go after the whistleblowers it honestly wouldn’t surprise me at this point if it was a bio weapon but to what you said that does pose a problem Australia has a dependent problem on China that they need to stop and try be more independent or this could continue to keep happening with no consequence A few returned orders does not constitute ALL!!! But I prefer a gov. doing it\\'s best to procure supplies, don\\'t you? unbelievable, we need a new government, one that will protect us. Ooohhhh but everyone wants Vaccines, and tests\\nAnd from where?\\nAnd why are WE locked down still if China is open? 21 million suspected deaths in China based on mobile phone closures. Also India is reporting funeral homes are having 3500 urns delivered every day. For each funeral home.  It will be months before we know the truth. Because CCP lied again when they zero infection. Their population don\\'t believe it. Don\\'t be  naive. Because according to the Chinese media, they had no infections and opening up as the economy needs it.\\nWhile in other countries, like US and UK, they slowly crawling towards the top of the curve. \\nHere in the UK, they expect to reach the top Wednesday or end of next week.\\n\\n\\nIn 2 weeks, if all goes well, it will start to flatten.\\n\\n\\nBut, if international travel is reopening to early, and as we know, testing is still not working well, there people having all the symptoms incl. pneumonia and still test negative for Covid19 - my guess, false negative - but we also had false positives.\\n\\n\\nI guess, Australia is still under lock-down as this country is still climbing the curve, everyday the cases of new infected and cases of people dieing is raising.\\nBoth figures need to start dropping, like it is already happening in Italy and Spain. God almighty. stop inbound flights to Australia @Nice Gary clearly. PALM SURE mate what are u smoking? It seems to have kicked in. U clearly have no idea what u are talking about because basically everything you own is from China including the device ur using right now. how is australia going to receive medical supplies? They hardly produce any medical supplies themselves it\\'s probably just China selling you those medical supplies they bought from you a few months back.\\nMaking a fortune while looking concerned for human health, they are bloody genius! Be careful with CPP medical supplies. Don\\'t let CCP screw your country a 2nd time. View  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-9XHqpONGI It’s like they want us all to die or something. 😒 yes Now your getting at it. They bring fake bank notes in big amounts. They will be laundered in Chinese banks in Australia. My sources in China tell that they are printing a lot now, and you cannot distinguish the fake from the real. First l\\'ve heard of this..!we know CCP harvest organs of dissidents and prisoners, we have witnesses testimonies & video evidence.\\nYour extraordinary claim will require extraordinary evidence. Australian bank notes are only printed at Note printing Australia in Campbellfield Victoria, but good try. F F S    Big independent vote coming in this country I reckon. Cory is a bit of a smug so and so. Mighty Mightor  independent career not long , wanker life time. He is an independent and a wanker. What secret mischief is the Aust gov upto 290boss frydenberg said he was getting millions of masks and other med supplies from \"international sources\". I wondered why he said it like that. Meanwhile Aussies cant visit each other... And they can just fly in. Im pretty sure we trade with other countries and not just China good luck with getting medical supplies then I would support a war against China. The entire world- Vs China. I\\'ve had enough. China keeps prodding us. i wouldn\\'t even allow a fart smell from china to reach me. I am disgusted in whom ever is allowing this to happen @Victor Victor ..Quite right mate!..If Aussie companies\"outsource\" to wherever,TO MAKE MORE PROFIT BY REDUCING MANUFACTURING COSTS,...then they take some of the blame.Same in Planet England too.Everyone blames China,without looking at the overall picture.\"Outsourcing \"has been going on for years,...(I bet many Australians love their dividend payments,boosted,helped by overseas low production costs😉) @Victor Victor  you mean like this, https://youtu.be/OMqviRYC24c, from the Taiwan times, , I do feel for the front line workers,  did you also know that there is 18 new billionaires in China since this has started , all in the medical industry, go to WION, and check in out, not having a crack at you, Why not disgust yourself for not competent to make all those medical stuffs by your own. Look at those doctors and nurses without appropriate protective gears, what have you done? corey  your a n.w.o. man on your bike. after all the tough talks, business as usual with china again? dont give a dam if it is coummunist or.not, money talks... \\'Much needed goods\\' ....that were stripped from our shelves. It\\'s probably a toilet paper drop. Don’t worry Pauline,the aircraft and crew is here just to get some toilet paper at coles and wollies and will fly back to Wuhan very soon I\\'d rather wipe my arse with red clay dirt than CCP issues dunny rolls solely out of principle. They are picking up the medical supplies :)) LOL China is making billions from their Wuhan virus \\nThey are the biggest makers of testing kits/ masks/ clothing for health workers/ respirators and are selling them to governments worldwide\\nHow can any government allow a flight from Wuhan or from any place in China. Unreal the amount of Chinese a..lickers there are in our gpvernments. Even W.H.O. have China on board as Human rights consultants. You couldn\\'t make it up Our government knew that wuhan was lifting its ban. The plane was in the air when the offical ban was lifted. Our government doesn’t work for the Aussie people anymore. It appears our PM has been swayed by China. what about the 90 tonnes of medical supplies for the front line workers in australia? do australians not want the supplies? The government have allowed this to happen. They are foreign. Except when re infection was observed... FFS LOL if you had any doubts about who really calls the shots in the world then here you go. Tell your govt this is nonsense & shouldn\\'t be allowed - see if they listen to their own citizens or China It shouldn’t be allowed to land. Outrageous they better be locked down This Cory bloke might be getting nice Chinese paycheques or he isn’t worth the space he’s taking up. is might sound bad but we need it LUL \\nenjoy your next outbreak Guard your PPE equipment Australia! They\\'re coming to get whats left. \"So what\" u lost the whole interview with that one line. This guy is definitely a Chinese plant! Australia is a part of China...too late Think PRC owns more in Australia than the Australians nowadays. That sold everything including their souls Corey is a flog!!! IT PROBABLY HAS THE FAKE TEST KITS THAT SPAIN AND INDIA SENT BACK TO CHINA No it probably has Bill Gates & Wuhan’s So called Flu vaccines 💉 I will not be participating in any regard with any so called vacation programs, forced or otherwise and I believe that’s the next move, ( for the people’s good) yeah right !!! (WHO) Can you Trust anymore ? Only your self and your gut feeling. 🏃🏻\\u200d♀️ Or, even worse! ASIO WHERE ARE YOU. At the circus where they belong. Please explain? They are probably about to collect some Aldi bags. 🤔 And F..K OFF CHINA. Did Cory miss the story of all of those infected cruise ship passengers walking off the Ruby Princess in Sydney? I wouldn\\'t be so confident in assuming common sense. That is a joke. What happens if there is a strain on the cargo. Place Anti air craft at your coasts.  Australia should protect its future and it\\'s  people Everyone in the world is held by the neck by the CCP, imagine that? Money talks. 🤷 Today 51 south Koreans who have recovered from covid, have reported they are reinfected, ie. The virus is activated from within their body again. I\\'d be afraid of anything manufactured in China. Nothing is off limits to them. Not food (fake rice), toys, dog food, flooring, meds, steel, etc. It\\'s all tainted somehow. YES Death made in China 👍👍🙏🙏🤔🤔🤔 God bless pauline and sky news I hope Sky had a reporter at the airport to check who was on board/coming into the country and why are they really here? WHY MUST IT BE IN WUHAN..?\\nWHY NOT BEIJING OR SHANGHAI..?\\nSHANGHAI AND BEIJING ALSO HAVE AIRPORTS.. RIGHT..?\\nWHY ARE THE CARGO IN WUHAN..? Pauline has common sense. Thank you. There have been crews from some of these cruise ships caught wandering around supermarkets a few weeks ago before the standoff began, so of course this crew is going to be allowed to walk off the plane and around our city streets. wuhan is now one of the safest places on Earth concerning COVID :) the place with the best herd immunity Go on there Ms.Hanson. CH IN A is a non option. Does Benardi know that Italy. Spain, France, etc had to send back those \"much needed\" goods to China because they were defective Australia death toll from covid19 is around...  less than 50 ? and they decided to let plane landed straight from Wuhan? lol Obviously not enough of us are dying to meet Corey’s globalist masters’ requirements. Get ready for the second wave guys!!!! How  utterly useless our leader\\'s. \\nThey are bringing  our medical \\nSupplies  back. \\nOr  Chinese  knock offs. Benardi: That teacher is just a peasant. Lets believe the government, guys. \\n\\nPauline has to tell the truth. Because she knows the media will jump all over any mistake she makes regardless how innocent it is I think Pauline is pretty attractive for her age, and she has a brain on her shoulders to boot.. hahaha, way to old for me.  And I wouldn\\'t go there, but she looks alright for her age....maybe I do have the virus. Pity the brain is not in her head Sick man. Take a chill pill. Richard C - you got the virus mate...? That\\'s a slap in the face for Australians, pity Correy didn\\'t feel it. Look at his smile...he has NO fear...Meaning there is no danger Contaminated supplies. Meaning that companies going under is more dangerous then the virus You are such a selfcentre politician that play with Australian lives like kids play their games.. awful time to struggling with this current restricted situation then you easily open the other door to warm welcoming COVID-19 in from the beginning to not any end.. Who in the hell is the crazy fool that allowed this? So if more is spread then would you take responsibility for  it ? Good so if that happens will all involved be happy to go to prison for the rest of there lives. A cargo full of vaccines 💉 \"Surpluss medical supplies\"yeah ,i would not trust any supplies from china This is a f**king joke let’s all go to the beach for Easter How disappointing to hear Cory Bernardi talking like that. \"imports\" \"exports\" as if nothing else matters. I never thought Cory was a globalist. ',\n",

How dare of him?!! @fizikidz94 That means he got paid for working on this, and that he had some say on what was involved in the series and how the final product looked. He still didn\\'t pay for anything. @Hark Moviesuhh, he actually is one of the executive producer for this series dont want to ruin your comment but RDJ just host this not pays for everything.

I really wished to watch that autonomous driving is breaking the lap record. Wouldn\\'t it make more sense to beat the fastest track time instead of max speed?  Track time is a complex parameter that basically comprises everything else.  While max speed is just that. to be fair, that car lacks the 80-ish kg that the driver weighs.  To have a real comparison, they should put a bag of cement on the driver\\'s seat. When trying to achieve speed, weight does matter I want to know what the constraints for that record are. 200kph is SLOW for racing. Let alone a world record. \\n\\nIt\\'s massively impressive to get the AI car around the track, not trying to knock that... Just poking fun at their idea that 120mph is a real record to break... Throw a GT cup car, LMS GT or F1 on the track and they\\'ll easily reset the 200kph record. 😜 They should have interviewed Elon Musk about Space X and Tesla because his visions and ideas are way ahead of everyone. Tesla\\'s autonomy hardware is years ahead of any autonomy hardware that exists as Elon said he couldn\\'t find any and had to make it themselves. All the Tesla Cars currently out there are hardware ready and they are waiting for Software approval for Full-Autonomy. They are even preparing another generation chip for the future ahead. The only industry close to commercial useable full autonomy is Tesla. None of this would be possible without the breakthroughs made in single-board technology What do you want your name to be *This is AI introduced me to itself* Ничего не понял но люблю detroit become human @zhigyli ясно👀 @И Л но тогда люди будут безработные @Алина Сидорченкова но он чуть похож на него @_Green-Tea_ мне Кэра норм @Fox \\n\\n\\n\\n.. *he\\'s alive.*\\n\\n_niiice._ Рука из битва экстрасенсов.. @Гриб Праведник susu bessar @Гриб Праведник jdfdl Экстрос Ааааа реально Yo don’t blame me if we are gonna be owned by the robots soon Nope o will not blame you, I promise :) 😖😰 Alguém aqui Fala português?

I seem to remember volumenous book about game programming and collision detection algorithms. I also remember masterclass of design, coding and game - Total Anihillation. Quarter century  old RTS game, which some people run successfully today on 4k displays, despite original, \\'recommended\\' requirements being Pentium 120 MHz and 32 MB (that\\'s with \\'M\\'). Somehow it managed to track up 500 units + their shells over 3D terrain. AI was... well; not on the level of Z and on occassion it bottled up units building factory in wrong place. Still, the way how units navigated was amazing; holds up even today. The code in that game used to solve quite similar subclass of problem, tracking 3 modes of reaction to spotting hostile units... on hardware built IN A CAVE WITH BUNCH OF SCRAPS   compared to what single Nvidia board for embedded system offers.  Also - ST TNG episode \"Booby Trap\" has relevant quote.... for 40 years we have autonomous cruise missiles, shuttles capable of almost autonomous mission and ships and airliners that basically fly themselves.

Great yes? Who want to be my YouTube friend Your teachers are also too good but you have never been serious in the study when you r in school as much as this vdo😊 I hope I’m not the only one watching during the summer to get ahead before school starts 😂 same i was put in 2 science classes, living environment and chemistry. i’m honestly terrified if i’m going to fail or not u r Your not alone bud Same 😂😅 I’m taking Gen chem 1 this upcoming semester Im here too Wow! You explain complex subjects in such simple language. Feynman techniques, she did a great job! Superb Who want to be my YouTube friend Scope of entrepreneurship As it should be. i wish i had a teacher like u in chemistry ! There is a teacher, his name is Walter and he might be good for you Self isolation got me studying for a chemistry class I haven’t started yet 💕 this was super helpful and easy to understand, thank you Same I’m 11 Cami me too! I’m 51 & loving this I am so glad to hear that - you are welcome.  Stay safe and healthy. Wow my entire first month of high school chemistry teaching sessions in less than 20 minutes. Thank you so much, very well explained without becoming tedious and boring. You\\'ve manage to teach me what my teacher have been trying to teach our class in 3 weeks in 18hrs Giovanni B \\n3 hour class twice for 3 weeks, maybe. Looks like he still has to learn basic math as well no name Oh! Thanks! ^^\\' Saaaame You mean 18 minutes, right? Absolutely fantastically helpful for beginners to understand the basics of chemistry. You make learning so much fun. Thank you. I\\'m out here trying to learn university level chemistry and i haven\\'t done chem since grade 10 :((\\nthis video did wonders to try to get my head in the game, thanks Prof, Penguin! You are most welcome - I\\'m so glad to hear it was helpful!  Good luck to you!!! Can anyone write my essay? Damn essay writtings! Fran Brunetto no , becouse you can *essay-maker.all-about.in* - this service has done well with all the papers I requested or needed. WOW!\\xa0 I was able to get through Chemistry 1 and I learned more on this video then the entire 16 weeks of lecture. I am a visual learner.. Thanks for the help! You\\'re giving me ideas for a second channel and another alias!!!  :)   Your like the Bob Ross of chemistry. ThePenguinProf thanks for the video You\\'re* 😊 nailed it! Thanks for that!  :) Half Life 3 confirmed. I was thinking about that in the \"Half Lives\" section. But can it run crysis? 😂 perfect. I remember as a kid thinking the Chem conversations were preposterous... Idiots going beyond a second half life, pssshhh. @FrankGarrett316\\xa0ayy lmao 7:18 I\\'d honestly date you in a heartbeat!! 😍😍😍 You\\'re the coolest teacher,when I get older and do chemistry I wish you could become my teacher but that won\\'t happen cos I\\'m in SA This lady is a genius! I was struggling with this for 4 years but now, I understand this! This was so well presented. I had not studied chemistry in nearly thirty years, and now I am trying to learn as much about it as possible. Your video really helped. Thank you. God bless this lady! so helpful! Thank you so much!!!  Thanks for watching! i need to draw penguins in chemistry now....... 😂 Ha haa.. OMG Thank you\\xa0SO much. I love everything about this video. You have taught me 18 minutes what my teacher failed to teach me in 5.5 hrs.\\nYOU ARE A LEGEND. Wow thank you so much this was so helpful. I literally was like \"that\\'s it?!\" Haha 😁 WOW. I never realized chemistry could be so much interesting. Keep going the good work. God bless. When I took chemistry 10 years ago in high school I didn\\'t understand anything, but thanks to videos like this it\\'s much easier to learn and enjoyable as well. This is just great! In 18 minutes I understood what I didn\\'t in highschool. The future of education is online, and thanks to people like you, Penguin Prof. Cheers :) You are a reason why I want to become a teacher! Amazing, thank you so much jeez bro Lol, the earth is mostly iron! We have only been able to drill 8 miles into the supposed 21 mile thick crust, we don\\'t know squat. Consensus science is killing us. Awesome video! You deserve more subscribers for your efforts, this helped me out with my geology stuff 5 months of chemistry explained in freaking 18 minutes with simple words. Thank you ThePenguinProf Woo hoo!  Thanks for letting me know! I am going to do my huge Chemistry exam next month, thinking i am going to fail, but this video actually gives me hope! Thank you so much for explaining this the way you did :) especially keeping it interesting by using images, here and there. Renecha Boyce Mine is tommorow mario me you\\'re. So nice to people How did the test go? Person: it’s used for dating\\nMe: maybe my friend would like that I’m learning from you that I will ever in my life at school When you just love chemistry so much \\n\\n...Here is an example\\n1st Day of School \\nTime for chemistry\\nChemistry teacher:Hi I\\'m your chemistry teacher and I would love you to introduce your names .\\n\\nWhen you are the only one\\n wearing red...\\nChemistry teacher:You with the red shirt please introduce yourself to class\\n\\nYou:oh..uhh.. hi good\\n morning  ummmm... \\nI\\'m chemistry and I love Tracy \\n\\nClassmates:hahahahhaahhahaahh hi chemistry we know you love Tracy\\n\\nYou be like :*ohmygod this is sooo embarrassing* ummm I\\'m so sorry miss/sir  I was supposed to say \"Hi I\\'m Tracy and I love chemistry I live in California\" and that is about all \\nChemistry teacher:ummmm....OK....just take your seat Thanks! I Am Homeschooled, And This Gave Me A GREAT Understanding! Like To Note Though* I Think You Got Geeky And Nerdy Confused. Geek = Fiction, Tech, Games. Nerd = Studies, Math, Games. But With This, I AM NOW A GERD! YOU ARE AN AMAZING TEACHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH Thank you so much for this! You\\'re so good at explaining. This was amaaaazing! Thanks so much. It was lots of fun to watch. I agree, this was extremely helpful!! Thank you so much! +Curlista Thanks for letting me know! Thank you for taking the most ridiculously explained (in text) concept and turning it in to simplistic penguin fun.\\xa0 I appreciate this sooooo much xD Lewis Diagrams now make sense. This video is very useful, becouse of my dream is chemistry department but I don\\'t know\\xa0chemistry so i\\'m very sad\\xa0thank you!! video upload!!!!! Thank you! That was extremely helpful. You make it so simple to understand! Two thumbs up for me! this is such a nice informative video, helped me understand simple chem a lot better then other teachers i have, great analogies, thank you so much Omg this is so helpful and clear! I love the analogies you used! Thanks! You sound like the OS girlfriend form She (movie). Your way to explain complex things is a gift. You and Don Lincoln are the best tutors a student can wish for! Thank you so much!  I\\'m glad you are finding my videos helpful. That felt to damn simple. I love it! thank you for this, I moved to a different country 2 years ago and because of the language barrier and other issues I have missed out on so much knowledge and I haven\\'t been able to move forward in school and this has helped me get a better understanding so when I go to school, I\\'ll just have to kind of translate everything and memorize the names of things in the language (I mean things such as what hydrogen is in the language and so on) I already have the knowledge now all I need is to translate it... this made my life easier so thank you This is a great way to review chemistry, thank you!  Yes, I can remember my ordeal when I took my chemistry, I was kicking and screaming the whole way too. You saved my life. THANK YOU! The best analogy I heard about an atom an an electron: Imagine a football field. In the center of it is a ball. That is the nucleus. then image a pea whizzing around the seats. That\\'s an electron You sound like my momteacherfriend, I feel so safe listening to you. \\n😂 Oh, that is so wonderful to hear!  Thank you and I\\'m glad you shared that with me.  🐧❤️ you have such a graceful voice! you make something like chemistry, sound so calming! Thank you!!\\xa0 hold on wasn\\'t you supposed to get how much an energy level holds by the equation 2n2 (the 2 after the n is square (x2) ) You just earned a subscriber! <3 Much love to you for these videos! I\\'ve always struggled with chemistry but you made it so much simpler thank you so much! Absolutely great video. \\xa0Great ideas and just an extremely effective way of simply describing the fundamentals. \\xa0Thank you! This was incredibly amazing. I went into my first organic chem class, and they reviewed inorganic (haven\\'t taken in 8 yrs) and I looked like a deer in headlights. This definitely helped in refreshing my memory. Thank you! I never understood Chemistry, Im so gonna binge watch on this. *saves video Thank you! And much love from a high schooler 🙏🏽 The explanations are so descriptive and well thought out. I\\'m really struggling in school because of a rare and very strong case of adhd, but this video was able to keep my brain interrested the whole time, and i learned more from this short video, than in 2 months of school. I really love you for your awesome teaching skills🤩 Thank you SO much for letting me know.  Best of luck to you!!! Thank you very much! Much easier to grasp after watching this, and feel a lot more confident with science as a whole! Going to continue on into part II now, just wanted to show my appreciation! :) So glad you found it helpful!  Thanks for watching! Electron acts like both wave and particle at the same time that\\'s why her \"cotton candy\" analogy is true. I love that analogy... it was not my idea, but I spread it far and wide. Loved this so much very informative!! I started watching this video with a rather negative perspective on chemistry probably because of my chemistry class in high school but I have to take it again in college now and thisvideo mkes me feel relieved and it gives me hope to understand chemistry   and actually finding it interesting! Thank you so much for this😁😁 Holy sh## I understand what you are saying :D \\nI love the way you talk so passionate about this. It makes me glad and intressted!!\\nLove from finland!! You are such a good teacher, thank you so much! Thank you so much for these videos. I don\\'t love Chemistry but I do love penguins and you keep it very interesting to help me learn the material :) The Prof is a genius! Thanks so much, I’m 51 & finally understand the basics. And it’s free Woo hoo!!!  CONGRATULATIONS!!!  I\\'m so happy to hear that!  Keep up the good work and thanks for watching! This was amazing, although, nice penguin obsession 😂😂 wow! I am so amazed on how good you have explained this. I have been struggling in chemistry. I am only in chapter 2 and I feel like I actually understand it now. THANKS ! I love how you explain!  From a teacher to another teacher, you are so good!! Wonderful explanation of concepts and fantastic visual aids!! 7:39 half-life 3 confirmed I never paid attention during the first lesson in my class but now I want to get into forensics so I want to learn more this helps thx you\\'re awsomest <3 helped me alot!!! Love you loads :* I, I, I love you, (sniff, sniff) I\\'m a college student after 31 years post high school. I have more confidence about Bio 101. Thank you so much! I like learning science, but my mind doesn\\'t kinda fit with chemistry subjects. when I learn about chemistry, I forget everything I\\'ve learned. But your way made me remember the things I was taught and forgot in just a few minutes. No need to put so much effort to tryna remembering what I\\'ve forgotten by studying from the books. Thank you. OMG! Thank you!! I have never taken Chemistry in my life, and although basic chemistry is easy, I don’t seem to quite get it 100%, your video helped me a lot!!! Everyone else is in high school and I am just getting out of 7th grade and I get these but this video help explain somethings 3:18 \\nThis and other (easier to understand) methods taught to me when I was younger is the reason I\\'m having problems with chemistry now.\\nGreat video! I learned so much thank you. Glad it helped!  Thanks for letting me know! This has been such an informative and helpful video! It is so wonderful to see women in Science doing awesome things!\\xa0\\nThanks Penguin Prof for helping this lady learn about Chemistry, such excellent teaching! I just finished Gen Chem I, and was so lost - I just used Chegg for everything. My mind was just blown - I wish I had watched this before the class! Thank you so much! thx nice lady with pleasent voice Really interesting to watch, remind me of old days... thank you :) This helped so much!!!! Thank you! Loved the penguins!!:) Wow! That was great and chemistry makes a lot more sense now! Thanks for the video! Absolutely amazing, how easy and beautiful chemistry is when you start to understand it! Thank you so much for the video! OK-- so-- this is just beautiful and sooooooo exciting! I\\'m floored. I never took chemistry because I was too intimidated! Prof, your video is like opening a book of secrets. I\\'m so grateful that you put this up in such a fun, clear and wonderful way. Thank you. Thank you. +mlhaske Wow - you\\'re making a penguin blush!  Thank you for watching!  :) THANK YOU!!!! I\\'ve had such a hard time understanding chemistry and your videos have explained it to me in a way I can grasp the concepts! Wow I can\\'t thank you enough for making these lessons available . You have an amazing gift of teaching and I truly enjoyed the idea of studying chemistry now. Thank you. Wow, This video was actually really cool to watch, thank you for doing this! Part II link is in the description box.  :)   I\\'m so thankful for this video, all term I\\'ve been having trouble understanding chemistry in class and this helped me cram everything just before the test I love watching your videos for fun, because the way you teach is just amazing.\\nYou should consider creating \"Penguin Academy\"- think Khan academy :)\\nThanks for this review- watching these videos prior to taking gen chem in the summer! Thank you for making chemistry interesting, fun and understandable! Thank you thank you thank you!!!! I want to prepare for medicine and need to get a grip on this....what a great start...I will be looking for more, thanks for this, teachers often over complicate stuff when it comes to chemistry. Part II link is in the description box. Wish I had a teacher like you back in the days. Wonderful presentation, I understood everything from the first view. Thank you :) I drew penguins on carbon in one of my tests and my teacher gave me an \"A\" xd Now I found you! What an amazing teacher! Thank you so much. Thank you so so so much for this. back in college after a hiatus and was feeling really behind. haven\\'t done chemistry in 6 years. this helped a lot. We took a whole semester to learn this and I’m watching this the night before my final and now everything is finally making sense That makes me so happy!!! ',\n",

Stop defending the fact that you are an idiot. Just embrace the wooosh After ignoring this for about 4 years , finally opened. What I got is *4 second of red YouTube Intro* ... Thanks YOUTUBE It\\'s a traditional thing to watch this “This video is unavailable on this device.” Youtube algorithm has brought us together again my brothers and sisters. I\\'m kinda surprised youtube is recommending a Pewdiepie video this much. Sama cokkk Because is famous like others! @Coley or no Because Pewdiepie has a lot of fans and they\\'re trying to get them to watch YT premium. Coley or            A wild aggressive teen spotted in its natural habitat. I don’t have YT red or whatever so it’s just 4 second of ahhhhh and the yet logo Why is this 3 seconds long? or is Youtube freaking out? YouTube recommended this more then 100 time\\'s \"This video is unavailable on this device.\" Remember when this show got cancelled because of a joke, yet YouTube brought back Logan Paul’s movie after he showed a suicide victim 🖕🏻 For some reason I have like YouTube has a bias True @Holy Hand Grenades 50% of what Pewds said for like 3 years was in poor taste. Tupac Shakur lmfao. You’re a fucking dumbass. Having a favorite YouTuber and favoritism are two COMPLETELY different things. Favoritism is when someone is clearly promoted over others by a COMPANY. Having a favorite YouTuber is not favoritism you absolute imbecile Why do YouTube keeps recommending me this, You couldn\\'t even watch it without premium. YouTube recommends this after 4 years “This video is unavailable on this device” Finally watched watched this after 3 years of it being on my recommended 0 to 0 hi Back when YouTube actually supported individual creators When did Youtube start to decline quickly? 2015? Ambar Neelam not really brought by pewds, was brought by YouTube because the mainstream media cornered/boycotted them using pewds and any excuse they could find at the time to prove YouTube had an issue and needed their support ABK BK \\nShut up, indian Nah it was shit back then too DeprecatingMemes what do you mean? 2016 was the most controversial and most dramatic year we ever got, diss tracks left and right beef everywhere leafy existed content cop is at his prime it was a good year Youtube why did you recommend this to me if it unavailable on this device you having a stroke? This has been in my recommendations for months. Bruh I\\'ve watched this and it\\'s getting recommended 4 years later Is this just not leaving anyone else\\'s recommended YouTube: **refuses to promote their biggest creator**\\nAlso YouTube: Hey y\\'all wanna watch Pewdiepie?!?!? T-Series is a publisher, not a creator @Lord of the Potato People he said biggest creator not biggest corporation Second biggest @Sad  holy shit how did you get that many likes in 1 week!!, Congrats, Bro!!! 👊👊👊 These comments are getting so boring holy shit The best four second video. sure do Imagine paying for Youtube Premium Lmfao.\\n\\nSentry from my IPhone Dammit why the video is unavailable on my device Yea...my problem too My problem too what do you mean this vid is unavailable on your device They recommend it to us. Just to advertise their Youtube Premium. Feline Samurai YouTube rewind is where yt puts popular videos in a single video so far yt rewind 2018 is the most disliked video on YouTube Yep I\\'m a victim tooo Kontol Youtube and youtube music. Best deal! Omfg they did ',\n",
       " 'I’m not a fan of Justin but nothing he said was wrong. Ppl to sensitive now a days smh true @Siphiwayinkhosi Tfwala they do Bec what he said was kinda egoistical alittel Sensitive and wrong. They have no right to always down grade what a person says just to prove a point that doesn’t even make sense. Can we just let people be and focus on ourselves. Stay out of people’s lives and what they say is their business. We should really steady respecting people Hard-working people are just not earning enough these days ...everybody is in dept\\n\\nFolk is getting angry at millionaires and I understand it kind of. Greetings from Austria What the hell is wrong with saying they are grateful they have what they have but they also acknowledge there are so many people suffering around the world who don’t have the same mansions to lockdown in.  Good for them.  Don’t get the problem with it.  People get the shits when someone says there unhappy in their mansion isolation, Justin Bieber was saying the opposite.  I think they’re great young people and good role models. Sock of people putting them down.  They work their arses off too, so leave them alone! Exactly!! Leave these people alone, they are showing love and acknowledgments! People are so bitter and jealous and it shows! They also have problems usually mental that are very serious, that they’re dealing with also! So let’s not dismiss them as if they’re not human being! Smh He should help instead of saying that \\nAnd making others feel like they\\'re better than them! My point exactly @Megan Cox. People will always spin your words and make what you say work in their favor. I honestly think Justin and Kendall said nothing wrong and to think that people are way focused on how this young successful people live their lives and how they view the situation and are tackling it is actually whack because there are greater problems in the world, other than holding what Justin said over his head. I mean we’re dealing with Covid 19 and there is no right or wrong way one can ever express how they feel about the whole thing, about the quarantine and all things. We should just focus on ourselves be grateful too and let people be. There’s so much in the world you know @Geri Ramirez  Of course! I feel like they fact that Kendall was there nodding along was what really set it off. Also even if he didn\\'t mean to but he did structure the sentence as if the rest who aren\\'t as blessed hasn\\'t worked as hard. I\\'m with you he has worked hard but he could have said it a bit better. It did come off slightly self centred. D C still doesn’t erase the fact that he worked hard to be were he’s at and just said he’s grateful to be where he’s at acknowledging not everyone has that opportunity sad people just keep looking for things to be mad at (talking about the tweets not you) What Justin said was actually really sweet.\\nI honestly don\\'t understand why he would get any backlash from what he said?! Meral Eldawlatly all bc someone has money doesn\\'t mean they are obligated to help others they could have talked about how well they are doing and how much they got and completely ignored the fact that ppl are struggling during this time but instead they took time to acknowledge the fact that not everyone is in the same position as them @Meral dawlatly he is helping he always helps it\\'s just that no one talks about it Bec he should help with all what they have instead of only being greatful for it I’m not really partial to Justin, but he’s.. telling the truth. Yes celebrities did “work hard” to get to where they’re at, but so do other regular people, and they don’t have a fraction of the fortune and comfort that these celebrities have. Justin was just saying that he’s grateful and that it sucks that times right now are like this. @L B Actually it is not.  Who pays the celebrities and athletes salaries  - the public.  who pays the teachers and nurses\\' salaries - the public.  So look in the mirror! @Ashten Healy Everyone has the right to spend their own money as they see fit. Preach!! And for what? Other people do things way harder than celebrities yet get paid nothing. Catherine Chetty shut up please... It\\'s their choice to donate... It\\'s not by force... And cos someone hasn\\'t come out and said SEE WORLD I HAVE DONATED DOESN\\'T MEAN THE PERSON DIDN\\'T DONATE..shut the F..KUP Catherine Chetty can you shut up please Nah Justin was saying it as it is. People just want to let their quarantine anger out on someone and celebrity privilege is an easy target How is he tone deaf? He wasnt saying other people dont work hard hes saying he is appreciative of what his hard work has earned him and feels sorry for those going through hard times. He said nothing wrong. Infact he said the reality and was being humble.  He basically meant that they need to take a moment to think, reflect and be grateful because while celebrities have worked really hard to get where they are at and should not feel guilty for what they have, there are other people who work really hard as well and yet are not as fortunate during this quarantine and are having a hard time.He said we need to think about those people and sent his love and support to them.Kendal and hailey agreed with what he said. This was so direct, there was nothing to misunderstand yet the Internet misunderstands and over-reacts as usual. Get an education people. I dislike Bieber but I don\\'t think he said anything wrong here. Neither him or Kendall are very good at public speaking, They should keep it to a minimum and to well covered ground *nor @Maiva La Yes, in general I like Ariana Grande Michael Kelly do you like ariana grande then😦 Justin, Kendall and Hailey’s live was so wholesome .. it was a good wholesome conversation. What he said is exactly what I say to me friends  - we talk about the people who can’t afford the things we have for sure . And we talk about how grateful we are.  Some people just live for drama - like they’ve never said I’m so grateful for me jobs or for my food - so many people don’t have this luxury!!! I mean if they haven’t that’s what’s tone deaf If his wife doesn’t have a problem with it - I don’t see why we should.. and my comment was literally about the conversation on their Live.. not their personal lives.. Which we truly know nothing about except what they choose to show us . O please  she was  with  him  before  she  hnmm Stay strong selena:) I want to try Selena Gomez beauty line, sounds amazing and she always looks classy. I hope she finds true love and gets married, has babies and live happily every after. She deserves this so much. She is one of my favorite singers and I admire her strength. @elle Jay \"One doctor,\" who HADN\\'T treated her, SPECULATED her ALLEGED alcohol consumption COULD worsen her lupus and threaten her life.\" That\\'s your best evidence to support \"She took her friends kidney then continued to be a junkie\"? Everything else after that comes from a unidentifed \"source\" whom they didnt directly hear from. Stop being hateful and bullying people every chance that comes up. Some day someone could \"speculate\" on your life and broadcast it to the world. \\nPS. People dont look and have skin like that if they\\'re addicted to \"alcohol, koke and crack\" Its true let her leave singing and go get married. Because her voice gets worse every day like goose. She\\'s playing the mental card to get attention so plz rest Selena go . I too hope she finds true love and gets married, has babies and lives happily ever after. The difference is that I wish it was with ME, ha ha. I\\'m definitely not eager to try her beauty line though since I\\'m a hetero male, but I did just order the SG \"dad hat\". I had to re-buy the album in the box set, because the individual hats were already sold out. It cost a pretty penny, but it\\'s my birthday tomorrow, so happy birthday to me. @elle Jay and that talko video doesn\\'t prove anything because Francia confirmed she is still in touch with Selena and they were good, late last year. @elle Jay you\\'re the only weirdo here, hon. Go and learn the meaning a fact because whatever you\\'re saying is nothing but facts. You\\'re an obsessed idiot. Selena is slaying it with her new music 🔥🔥🔥 loved the video for Boyfriend.  Souvenir gives me chills🔥🔥 @jane Ibrahim so if she honestly tells about her mental health, shes asking for sympathy? If you dont have anything nice to say please stay quiet. @Jamie Grennell Great in what! She has a terrible voice like she has food in her mouth. And if she is great why is she playing the mental card now to get attention or sympathy. @Amrita Adhikari how about learn to write before you go trying to put people down or just stay in your lane, asking someone if they are dumb lmbo. SELENA is actually a great artist. Slutlena cat sing you deaf dumb lol i love eveytime they post a video on Selena it always follow up with her ex LMAOO Honestly I think Justin was trying to make up for Kendall’s comment about working so hard to get her house renovated. Nothing wrong with what either of them said. Bernie Bro’s can shut up.  They’re so hateful and jealous. Oh please! “People are outraged”??? Really? Which people?? KJ was sounding \"bratty\" and JB actually steered the conversation to make it \"less bratty\" so not sure who has beef with that :/ I haven’t had social media for the last 3 years out of choice but these snip-it videos keep me updated on the celebs. Haha! iLOVEHollywoodLife ♥️ Think Justin really meaning to go along the lines of he’s grateful for what he has at this time because it a hard situation but it’s hard for everyone and there are people out there worst off but they did work to be where they are but there are still thinking about the less fortunate to but at the same time it’s not just them effected it’s everyone in the world and people should be thinking of them selfs and there own safety first Who cares about these people right now. 🤦🏽\\u200d♀️ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 My thoughts exactly. Can we focus on ourselves and let them be. So much is going on in the world for us to jump the gun and gold what people are saying over their heads. afrodesiacworldwide people who watch this video... this channel is about pop culture lol  🤦🏽\\u200d♀️🤷🏽\\u200d♀️ What is so wrong with the guy being thankful for what he has???? WE should all think about our blessings and stay thankful for what we have! You People are too sensitive.If he said i have nothing and i dont feel satisfide you would spit on him for being a spoild brat. I personaly dont rlly like him, but he didnt say anything wrong. you can think of selena what you want, but you gotta admit that she is the best example of \"what doesnt kill you makes you stronger. she might not be a good singer, but the last years of her lifes, with all the ups and the deeper downs, really shaped her and made her into a grown, self confident woman, who needs no man for approval anymore, and is happy on her own. i wish every woman would learn that after a heart break, we would all be more happy with ourselves. @Kathryn Pina i also dont think she is a bad singer, she has anxiety and panic attacks when performing live in front of a big crowd, even celine dion would sing bad if she suffered from that. i just said that because many people claim that she cant sing, and just wanted to tell these people, that inspite of her not being a good singer, she is still a mature and confident woman now and that we can all learn something from her when it comes to evolving and getting through hard times. Nadine Bürgermeister I agree except she is a good singer. Two or three bad moments don’t define a singers ability I can say so bc Im a singer myself. But anyways I completely agree girl I believe people are taking it way out of proportion, the video chat was an acknowledgement of the reality that is happening. It is being taken way out of context. It is so ridiculous how people are running with this crap. It\\'s just an opinion that was meant with good intentions. Just the fact that he mentioned it. That\\'s blown very out of proportion.  Anyone in their right mind can see he meant good by it however it came out to some  people.  People are so sensitive it\\'s crazy to me. Kendall said she \"think about it all the time...\" I\\'m like :❓⚪⚠️⚠️🚸💱...did you even donate anything ? Better learn from Kylie 😉... Why do you always look beautiful? The only women i wanna hear the news from❤️\\nAli i would like to see a movie your in ❤️ i think you would make a great actress ❤️ like i feel i can see you in the oscars i feel like you deserve so much you know. I see the star the celebrity in you. It’s weird but i do feel it. So what if she is tanned she went on holiday to Jamaica I don\\'t understand the reason they going public to talk about this. Well, you all have contact number of each other. You cam do video call from WhatsApp or maybe from Skype. Umm...dressing like Billie Elish isn\\'t a cool thing..you look sloppy in that awful green get-up. I just find it weird that Justin has hooked up with Haileys bests friends. Both Gigi and Kendall He didn\\'t hookup with gigi She looked high being anxious, fighting Skittles boys is in the comments! #muchlove from Skittlz Nation #goodvibesonly Shoutout to: ❤🙏 This is the 4th time subscribing to this channel. Anyone else been having this problem? I have had to check my favorite channels and most of them I had to subscribe all over again 😡🙄😏 I love hollywoodlife \\nCoz they never give up I’m first Hello Selena.... God bless I didn\\'t think he said anything bad. I\\'m first and first like lol this is the problem  of being famous 🙏 If I Don’t Get To Marry Selena Marie Gomez Then I’ll just be alone forever and Ever Shut up you simp 1st I love the song she is listening to right now she said that is a way to release you anger in a crazy way 🤭(I don’t fuck with you by Big Sean is like she is talking to someone ether Hailey or Jb 🤭 Arghh Lawd we wanted to know about Justin Bieber who cares about Selena for god sake make a video about her separate from Justin\\'s name give the girl her freakin damn spotlight mxm 🚶🚶 I saw nothing wrong with what Justin said.  It’s all good! They worked soo hard People are just really bored during this time and trying to stir up some drama 2nd Tea is at 2:24 Kendall and Hailey were born into wealth and game but Justin came up from poverty and did it all on his own. So he does have all the right to say he worked hard for what he has. And people have to also realize that being famous or having alot of money, well, it comes with a price you pay. Their lives are not always easy either, maybe even harder. They gave up their privacy becoming famous and as well as so much more. Justin is being honest and kind there is nothing wrong with his comment Annnnd this is just another clip of Justin being Justin... \\n\\nBut can we just talk about how he confirms the saying that people really do let themselves go after marriage. 😏 Andrea Y how? Its time to shut down Hollywood. 😳 Ali your hair is amazing👌 1st bu-en ... Lol 23 to My cousin name is ali I wish whisper-Lena would go somewhere ugh So true she needs to be mature ....such an immature tallentless bitch ...go read exposingsmg.com Whenever idont see her updates, I swear I can\\'t have a goodnite sleep, I\\'m mean Selena the powerful woman *& why is anyone surprised?* I think they make a lot more money than regular people.  It\\'s looked at because they have so much.  They work hard, but so do many other people who are not in your position.  I think Selena has it right though by saying it\\'s her life. It is!! Justin and Kendall definitely were done deaf but I don\\'t think they realize it... Geri Ramirez idk How? Selena actually needs him back because she want a Boyfriend 😋 she can have another boyfriend. Justin isn\\'t the only man and he is married- Justin needs to shut up 😂 She  and  he  was  together  and  he wife  playing  she  didn\\'t  know  this  and  she  calling  her  friend  some  fake friend because  the jenner are  fake  just  like  the  people they go round with  hnmm snowflakes will be snowflakes So basically we deserve to be poor and suffering in our little apartment because we didn’t grow into a famous family or have any talent or money connections ? _Morenita Chula_ Who said that you sound stupid I found nothing wrong with their conversation and young people should try to be happy and appreciative for the blessings that they have.  Everyone doesn’t have to be miserable at this time just to show that they empathize with you. Megan Cox well I’m old enough and mature enough to recognize that it’s not fair to get upset at others just because you don’t feel that they are suffering enough.......actually it’s mean and yes misery loves company but in this case, the World is suffering, so there are more than enough people to commiserate with, without adding these young people. Yes! Finally someone speaks some sense and isn’t cynical!!! Things won’t change in your life unless you change who you are inside.. Selena being at the same mental place in her life for years shows she needs to change from the inside thoughts and heart est I love you allyyyyy and I love your hair💛💛💛🌺🌺👍🏼👍🏼 Justin made Selena\\'s career easy PTRAINBOY her career was falling off when they met. He was bigger than her at the time. She had one way before she met him I really believe selena and justin\\'s story isn\\'t done...those two really loved eachother and still do i think <3 Selena is one who keep talking about Justin but Nahh Justin moved on long time back and is more happy and healthy with Hailey 🙌🏻🙌🏻 He literally emotionally abused her.Selena will never go back to him. Selena is thriving without him. United gays of invalids coronavirus is justin gayber and selena gomez Is that English ? 🤔 People who have should never feel guilty  about it...they worked for it.  People who don’t have are jealous of it.  If you want to be rich then go out and make it, or be lazy and complain about others who do. Justin didn’t say anything wrong Justin was better off keeping his mouth close :/ He made himself look dumb af and since hes AcKnoWledgInG less fortunate why dont he do something about it !!!! Independentsoul why? He was just acknowledging how blessed he is during this time and knows that there’s people out there that are less fortunate. Smh 🤦\\u200d♀️ Yeah Selena .. live your truth .. address you being drunk on your amazon promo for boyfriend 👏🏻 Exactly n guess what she can\\'t ever her entire life is a lie😂 thecolorfulvegan ? Was that met gala joke necessary??? Like she didn’t do the make up herself !! What’s ur problem ?? JB has bad music since sorry Not eveyone has the same taste and eveyone has the right to state their opinion so don’t be ignorant 🤓 Ahmad Essa then start singing gud music twat 10,000 Hours and Intentions!💕👌🏻 People are jus haters. Nothing is ever good enough for them. You say something good they talk, you say something bad that also talk. I mean at this point one can literally go insane trying to please people and the truth is nothing can ever please them. Kendall and Justin said nothing wrong. They worked hard to get to where they are at and to contrary to popular belief Kendall has worked her ass off to get to where she is (even despite who her family is). And for Justin he’s a young man who’s been through a bad phase bad and all of a sudden it’s now a crime for him to say he’s grateful. Y’all guys a lot is happening around the world now, people are constantly dying because of Corona Virus and a lot of homeless people did not have any place to go during this lockdown period. Instead of being grateful that you have a roof over your head and you’re able to take necessary precautions to ensure your safety (well I hope), you focus on hate and saying that they were bragging and all that and if they were so what? They can brag all they want because they have all those things. But they even weren’t. Can we just focus on more important things. I’m tired of people spreading hate and their false assumptions. Stop holding what people say over their heads and stop twisting their words and looking for a story where there is none. Kendall and Justin were just having a simple conversation, is that a crime now? He isnt better than anyone else and thats what i got from this that they think they are better off... money isnt everything in life nothing materialistic is...... just seemed shallow Yes Justin....\\nYou treat. Let\\'s just send our love and support over a chat to your celebrity mate, to the vulnerable who cant afford to eat and are dying. \\n\\nI mean yeah so blessed Green_tiger_lilly he has done both even though he is not obligated to do either I understand what he was trying to say I just dont think he chose the right words to say it even if kendall didn\\'t work, she would still be rich. i think people just like saying \\'they worked so hard\\' because it sounds cool to say. seriously i hear almost everyone saying that and its usually by people who dont even work hard lol because people who actually do work hard are not bragging about it Lmao Hailey baldwin born an raised In Beverly Hills mansion thanks yo her rich actor dad\\'s and  uncles😂😂 and keneall grew up in Beverly Hills mansion thanks to her Olympic gold medalist dad and her step dad was the lawyer for o.j. Simpson.. And her sisters are the Kardashian\\'s!! They haven\\'t worked hard a day in there lives..😂 Hi I like Justin Bieber and  he is good  to singer They where just bragging about there money. A lot of people work very hard at a real hard job some 2 or 3 jobs to survive. lindsey clauw 1. they are humans and money doesn’t buy happiness so if they wanted to yes they can! 2. That’s what Justin said!!!! He’s grateful and blessed not complaining so what’s your point? @Geri Ramirez they have no reason to complain at all. lindsey clauw He said that they shouldn’t beat themselves for having what they have because they worked hard for it (at least he did ) but also acknowledged that they’re lucky because a lot of people work hard and still don’t have it and knows that other people are struggling all he said is that he’s thankful and blessed for where he’s at  I’m Confused as to why ppl are looking for things to be mad at @Geri Ramirez he said people shouldend mind bc they worked hard to have what they have. And i just point out that others work hard too but don\\'t live in villas Geri Ramirez ikr I think he wanted to avoid using the word luck when speaking about their situation, because they worked hard for their achievements, but it gave room for a misunderstanding. It is very hard to find the right language sometimes when speaking about such sensitive matters. I can see he didn’t have bad intentions in saying it, it was more like a realization, but I can see how people can get offended cause yeah they “worked hard” but not everyone was born into a wealthy life which also comes with great opportunities for work and that’s how people can begin to take it the wrong way Was Rihanna listening to Nigeria song ???? I mean regular people like me work hard too, we just not as lucky as they\\'re to get notice by another celebrity or was born in a wealthy family.... So it did song tone deaf.... Cause he makes it sound like he got way he is of off hard work alone and it isn\\'t kendal too..... They\\'re many people working hard for way longer than they have and still having reach no where.... Just my opinion.....im not hating on them BTW. 1. Let\\'s be realistic folks...if Justin Bieber says \"Hi\"...Selenators are gonna drag him for it. Hailey looks scared every time Justin starts talking, because she knows how much HATE he gets and that people are just looking for a reason to hate on him. He really didn\\'t say anything bad or wrong. \\n2. Every time I see clips of Selena and Justin together 1:25, Selena ALWAYS looks so ARROGANT in those clips. Nowadays, she acts like she is such a caring person, but, if you look at her when she was with Justin, she always moved like she was on top of the world and she was so much better than EVERYONE else. I see why she went crazy when he married Hailey and why she is still struggling with the issue of Justin to this day. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GH-ILs0VrU @Amrita Adhikari I\\'m not even going to deal with you since you clearly can\\'t understand anything @Alex Vasquez her literal career n still her relevancy is based on JB dont even try ... she\\'s still obsessing over Hailey n riffing of weeknds music video...naming it as one of justines songs MR. NOBODY TRUE!!!! Same thing with Selena. If Selena does one little thing his fans attack her. Even if she has done nothing, they blame her. Maybe you should look at the whole picture instead of looking at one picture. Who cares about their relationship now? That\\'s old news. Move on. Clearly they have. Selena Gomez is such a pretty girl.....I hope she is better now Can’t respect Selena after she took her friends kidney but continued to be a junkie 🙄 You didnt have to say that about our selena, it was unnecessary!  It\\'s not her fault about that gala look! so weird to look at jusntin and his wife😠dislike! Selena is just one big issue. Nothing new with her Natalie Valenzuela nah the issue is that some people have nothing to do in their life other than spread hate and tear other people down. Each hater should start looking at his own flaws instead of looking at other people’s flaws and start hating on them. Nobody is perfect ugh. Leave her alone and stop hating on her. What she went through isn’t easy nor fun yet she still manages to shine through. Selena is such an inspiration. Sorry but this had to be said That\\'s  not true SELENA BACK OFF, SHE IS A MELO DRAMA WHO ALWAYS PLAYS THE VICTIM....... JUSTIN LOVES HAILEY ....... I m not a Justin fan but I think he was just looking on the bright side to cheer everyone up in this difficult time Who is he trying to cheer up lol?? Kendalls ego? Haileys ego?? Both born and raised in Beverly Hills mansions. They will be fine😂😂😂 She\\'s beautiful but talent?? Nah! I skip it. She\\'s not worth to Justin. I\\'m happy Hailey stick to him thru his thick & thin life. ',\n",
       " 'Spoiler Alert: They don\\'t actually play the game. They just talk about it. SMHHHHHHH true They are just playing it on the original games but they are doing it on a HD tv its not clickbait they didnt say it was gameplay footage of super mario 3D all stars. The title states they played it wow what a ripoff Excited to have these legendary games PORTABLE. Wild. Greatcoolman2 64 DS is great but the original 64 is pretty different. Both are great in their own ways hal bond I may be getting 3D all stars for Christmas and I’m so excited. I feel like a little kid excited for Christmas again @Greatcoolman2 it\\'s just not the same game @Greatcoolman2 64 DS is amazing but we all know it being on a DS holds it back @Lecsan Seow No The editing on this video and that outro song are hilarious 😂 Cringe The editing on this video and that outro song is hilarious 😂 Nah it\\'s cringe mate 👀 Yess😂😂😂 Nintendo played a Nintendo game\\n\\n“Congratulations you played yourself” Jjjjjjjajajajaa Hahahahahha Lol. I don\\'t have time to play with myself Koichi! We need MG2!! Umm it says on the website that its a update same with odessy @Stacy Freeman I still want coop in 64 via a patch or something I know it\\'s a pipe dream but still it sounds like alot of fun. if you look theres arrows at the bottom of the game select screen METAL GEAR!? Metal Gear!? Never played sunshine, so let’s change that in 6 days\\nEdit: thought Mario Sunshine was pretty good. Not my favorite, and I don’t like how fludd controls, but other than that, it’s pretty good. JY TV ok I will. come on edit the comment! Me too man I didn’t play it kjellywood well, I own a GameCube but I don’t have sunshine on it. Duuuuh its gamecube i played only luigis mansion on 3ds and mario kart double dash on an emulator on pc almost every gamecube game is from 2003 and thats the year when im born i always wanted to play mario kart double dash and it finnaly happend to me and super star saga is from 2003 also but thats gba i got both version gba and 3ds but gamecube is always be the console i almost never played but im glad nintendo switch players can play sunshine im happy for you Nintendo: “We played Super Mario 3D All Stars”\\n\\nYes Nintendo, yes you did It was all actually a dream Nintendo says and the game was never made or coming out Oh those darn Nintendo people and their easy early access to Nintendo games! It would’ve been troublesome if they didn’t. Alternate title: nintendo rates their own game “It MIGHT be biased considering we sold and created it but I give it 5/5” \"Super Mario Offense #1\" was the only time I\\'ve ever laughed at one of these videos 0:21 with the galaxy 2 music, okay Nintendo, cheers for acknowledging you missed 2 out 😭😭 Better come out when these 3 are inevitably sold separately on April 1st as a 4th @Silly Skeleton still you could appreciate that they at least tried putting mg2 on there and still nintendo is a company after all @master ims Nah, they wouldn\\'t do that. The industry standard is $60 for a new release and I don\\'t think Nintendo has ever budged from that price point for a first party Switch game. @Silly Skeleton this was the beta days so it could have had a diffirent price let say 80 dollars @master ims That\\'s a pretty weak excuse to drop a game from the collection and still charge full price. They didnt miss it it was in the beta of the game but didnt put cause they couldnt optimize the controls since mg2 is harder than mg1 Nintendo after replaying the same clip with a slo-mo effect: I have achieved *gen z humor* Ryan Conner .. Silence, brand repeating something that isn’t funny slower isn’t funny It\\'s better then what the boomers usually come up with .... \"Super Mario Sunshine Is the most different Mario game ever.\"\\n\\nMario Galaxy: \"Excuse me?\" @What Loneliness Does To A Person sunshine doesn\\'t even have a long jump, thats why its different I played SMG when everyone played it on the Wii. @Jakitron Sunshine Don\\'t Got A Jetpack Either, It Do Be Having F.L.U.D.D Tho @Jakitron Nope Does Mario Galaxy have a jetpack? (I\\'m actually asking, never played it) Hey Nintendo, my mom said it’s my turn to play, so hand it over right now. Funny how this got 64 likes @Rodian_SkyPyratz I pre ordered the Digital Copy Luke Vlogs I preordered the physical copy. @Rodian_SkyPyratz  the physical copy comes out Friday the digital comes out Thursday in USA Squid Jenkins No. I’m in America. The editing is so random I thought this was a YTP. Mr Salty \\nYeah It looks like a bad and unfunny YTP I like how they are talking about these games like they just got released but have been out for decades. @SirSinclair I know Believe it or not A lot of people have never actually played them they kinda are, i mean, its new on the switch. Chip Corley This was the whole point Nintendo: *we played the game that we made!*\\n\\nIdk I get what they\\'re saying but I just find it funny 😆\\n\\nNext up: \"we played Pokemon!\" -gamefreak Nintendo played with themselves Oh hey its that guy that I am subbed to (: These people aren’t apart of Nintendo, more a part of Nintendo’s youtube channel. They get to play these games because of being in the channel. They didn\\'t even play the game lmao, Nintendo sheep eating this crap up like the goodboy consumers they are. 900th like We Played Super Mario 3D All-Stars!\\n\"But you didn\\'t.\" Nobody: We PLaYeD MarIO 3d AlL StaRS\\n\\nNintendo minute: Talk about Mario 3d all stars The fact that nintendo could be doing a Mario Galaxy 3 is what keeps me living Super Mario Universe motor78 it may be similar, but I find them like two different stories and branches Odyssey IS Galaxy 3 I already pre-ordered the game, it will be my first time playing Sunshine, I\\'M SO EXCITED :D @Oshabot 16 Emm... Hola?? Hola taco That game is one of the first games I ever played The first game I beat was super Mario land on Gameboy in 1994. I got stuck on the last boss for 6 months. I beat Duke nukem 2 after that. Same I got 64 for the Wii U eShop and got galaxy short after the Wii I got the Wii Alternative title: We talk about Super Mario 3D All Stars @Spaceman Alph Yep First time to. Also rip pre order. No more amazon Mazin Osman Stop linking this time stamp, there isn’t any actual “game *play* “ its just a still shot of Mario sleeping. And considering how he only shows it for three seconds in an eight minute video it’s definitely clickbait @Aaron Collis Me too just played sm 64 and galaxy but never got a game cube which I regret today but I am excited for sunshine I’m gonna play sunshine for the first time I already played all of the Mario games, so I\\'m going to play them in order of release. Nintendo thanos snapped Mario Galaxy 2 out of existence. 0:20 Galaxy 2 power star theme exactly !! 7:06 \"I definitely didn\\'t think he\\'d be going to space.\" He went to space twice. We need Super Mario Galaxy 2 in a second collection. The hunt for the green stars was true challenging fun. Plus playing through the game again as Luigi proved he CAN reach greater heights than his brother. Jumping higher, but with a little less control is just his style. A true accomplishment for the man in green. AND 3D Land! Don\\'t forget about it! \"We Play Super Mario 3D All Stars\"\\n\\nShows like 30 seconds total in gameplay It’s the same games you’ve played 10 years ago lol Yoshikage Kira fair point they should just watch a let’s play Yoshikage Kira true Cifu SSB. IKR lol cubemaster 34 ikr Lol they\\'re trying to create more hype Lol they\\'re doing their job @Ryan Conner ik right. its just so annoying. dang. I hate when literally anybody is doing the work they\\'re paid for. It’s working 😭😭😭 So they\\'re doing their job ? \"It\\'s a spoiler, we can\\'t say it.\"\\n\"That\\'s not true.. :(\" 1:20, he says that like he had just recently learned how to pronounce it right BATT-L ...

And we have been robbed of the Backwards Long Jump in SM64, F in the chat y\\'all. I\\'ll be playing all of the 3 games for the first time in my life. excited! Krysta: \"Oh! Is he sleeping? That\\'s my favorite part of the game- ( *I love it when he sleeps, he\\'s so cute! Shhh!* ) Uh- *tIrEd* ! \"personality never seen before in a mario game\" so that\\'s it huh, we\\'re just gonna ignore all mario rpg games. I\\'m beyond excited for these 3 games!

It\\'s a review video. 3:37 Krysta: Super Mario Sunshine is the Most Unique Mario Game\\n\\nDr.Mario: Hold My Beer I’m only here for the gameplay idc about the commentary. #50 on Trending for Gaming\\n\\nSonic\\'s voice: Phew, just made it I’m going to be playing all of them for the first time going in chronological order. Can’t wait 😝 Imagine beeing in a pokemon battle against mario and he is like: \"Fine Luigi use Dirty Dishes!\"\\nAnd your Arceus gets completely destroyed by a dirty dieses throwing luigi. \"I\\'ve never owned a N64 so I never really played Super Mario 64\". Well, you could have played it on the DS (or 3DS). The DS version of it was totally great. Almost a totally different experience, though, so not quite the same. April can\\'t come soon enough, definitely asking for this for my birthday! While you\\'re at it you should ask for DMC DeLorean with time equipment attached for your birthday. (by the way I can tell you were joking and it was funny, figured I\\'d joke back.) Hey, I know everyone else said this, but it wont be sold both physically AND digitally after march, so maybe ask for it for Christmas :) i hope you can get it before march 2021 my dude The game is only available until March my guy @Mr. Some Gamer Dude yikes This is actually really cool,please release the outtro fully. Also why is saying Fludd name a spolier? Also also,why did they play the game? OHHHHHH MY GOD MY MONEY IS READY. I Just How Love The Mushroom Moves In The Intro Thingy “I never owned a Nintendo 64”\\n-someone 10 seconds away from disaster @That1Flamingo the wii sure is a wonderful console, not only can you play any gamecube game on it, but it possesed probably the largest selection of legacy content on nintendo hardware to date @ayman aboufarise i had to miss out sadly, but i was able to use the virtual console on the wii I never owned one also. I was young. SMM2 MickeyInk sane, too bad there’s no reason to own any of those in a few days Super Mario 64 DS Version is the Best. Note: \"Played\" is a past-tense word, so the title of this video still rings true. Oh my god I love galaxy. That’s the first game I’ve ever played in my entire life. Of course the gameplay of galaxy 2 is even more polished, but come on that game wouldn’t exist without this one. So many memories playing this game when I was 5... Francis Hong same dude, I was looking for a wii on Craigslist just to replay super Mario galaxy like a week before the announcement dropped. The nostalgia is really about to hit different Nintendo’s gaming confession: we got rid of the one of the most defining mechanics of the game because it makes us look like bad programmers, the BLJ! Nintendo: We\\'re playing our own game!\\n\\nNintendo🥇   👈 Nintendo I’m gonna play 64 first 100% it \\nSunshine 2nd 100% it \\nThen my favourite Mario game of all time Galaxy and 100% it @_ PolishMafia311 lol could you imagine _ PolishMafia311 probably won’t happen but that would be sick And by doing so, hopefully unlock Galaxy 2 (wishful thinking). This going to be my first time playing these games I can\\'t wait This is my first time playing all these games! My first console was my switch! I can’t wait for this and 3D world. I played 3D world at my cousins before and I really loved it! 4:42 D. Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device! I played Sunshine when I was a kid and I still remember it! This a just one of like one million ways to flex that they got this early, Isakay Yik Pokemon was just my first game Member perks :/ And show us very little about the actual menu. 😔 ThePikachuKing I dont know if pokemon is so good Anonymous Idea I guess I got mixed up there, I meant 3D allstars. When I see Mario galaxy I get flashbacks of me having a really good time when I was 7 Nintendo: well I guess now is the time to get all those ps1 kids from the nineties playing super mario 64 and sunshine Shame Super Mario 64 didn’t get the 16:9 treatment. WAIT, the opening of the collection uses a theme from Super Mario Galaxy 2! DLC confirmed?! *when you get clickbaited by Nintendo themselves* @Big Boss They were reviewing it the whole time. They didn\\'t do a good job at it, but that\\'s what it was supposed to be. Kosmid I did read the title...We played 3D All-Stars? Where’s the review part? It’s been 6 minutes trying to find it but I can’t. How many times do I have to comment this? It is a review video. I\\'m sorry you were expect a gameplay video or some crap, but this is purely a review of the game. Read the title right, and take the video for what it is. Lol ikr!! Roman Torchic I guess they meant it for Nintendo “Minute” 😆 Nintendo: We played the new game!\\nMe: Okay, can I see some footage?\\nNintendo: It\\'s a review.\\nMe: Why didn\\'t you say so? 0:37 sounds like it would fit in an rpg “It’s fine let the temp edit the video, it’s not like they will use assets from games that are not in the collection...” lol\\n0:21 The game has no graphics changes! They want us for the same game, probably more expensive! \"We show trailer bits and talk about the games instead of playing them\" The video is NOT clickbait. It\\'s a review of the game, not a gameplay videos. It\\'s called \"We Played 3d All Stars\" not \"We are playing 3d All Stars\". at least they showed the menu, i was wondering ab that THANK YOU, yeah this video is just bad. Almost clickbait. 2:10 @Stop Misandry and Gynocentrism its like she\\'s never reviewed a game before and instead of focusing on actual features she just calls it cute and fun for the whole video YouTube Gamers: \"We got more Super Mario 3D All-Stars footage on Nintendo Minute!\"\\nNintendo Minute has never been so relevant Ohh boy!will be playing “galaxy”for the first time🤭and finishing sunshine for the first time. I\\'ve never played SM Galaxy, I\\'m over hyped for this game. Gaming confession of mine: never owned the original DS, never owned the Wii and the WiiU. So, yeah 😅 Geez why couldn\\'t they increase the internal aspect ratio with sm64. Not hard to do. We pretend to play Super Mario 3D All-Stars. @Micha - yeah they are. If you say “Super Mario Galaxy” is my favorite game, that is an opinion @Riley Freedman Because these aren\\'t opinions! @Micha - yeah but you kept straight up saying they weren’t opinions @Riley Freedman you do know this is called marketing right? lol The 3D all-stars pack is amazing, but is too expensive in my opinion. @Cosmic Gaming 60 dollars is actually a great price when you think about it, but ok. Raptor I think an acceptable price would be like 20-30 dollars. Yeah, it\\'s too expensive tbh. Sunshine is only like 100 dollars on Ebay or amazon. There are two games that will always have a special place in my heart: Mario galaxy, and skyward sword. The fact that they were able to transfer the controls for galaxy to the switch makes me 99% sure that skyward sword will be coming next year for Zelda’s 35th! I have never played Super Mario Sunshine, and I must confess I’ve never even heard of it till this bundle was announced. That alone is gonna be soooo worth the $60 tag to me. So excited about it! Brace yourself, there’s full voice acting and Bowser talks full sentences in English in this game My recent memories included the part where I had to collect the purple coins. I got dizzy playing that part lol. Please just show us the Bowser fight.\\n\\nWe all want to know Bowser\\'s sexuality. @ACE SAMM\\nDude, chill out.\\nIt\\'s just a joke.\\nEveryone knows that Mario says \"So long, kinga Bowser!\" but the sound compression made it sound \"So long, gay Bowser!\"\\nAnd now he says \"Bye-bye\", people are just joking about the fact that it sounds similar to \"Bu-bi\".\\nAlso, \"Weird message in kids games\", even IF Mario actually says \"So long, gay Bowser!\" I don\\'t think this could cause problems for some kids.\\nEven because in one of the first Kirby games, can\\'t remember which one, there were some blocks that have the form of...  ehm, yeah.\\nThis Mario things are actually funny, there are other games like Kirby that time where maybe it\\'s not a nice secret (and Gygas).\\nHowever this Gay and Bi Bowser thing is just a meme, a joke.\\nYou can\\'t tell this is a \"Weird message in kid games\" and disrespect like this people that enjoys this jokes. It uses Shindou, so no gay Bowser. Nah. No way bruh. No way I want to know that in A GAME AIMED FOR ALL AGES!!! eri_noemi I was going to SAY, “Finally, someone with common sense!!!” But that last comment basically makes me say, “oh wait, you like weird jokes in kids games too? Well... never mind...” I’m sorry, but. That is how I roll. Cintrón Productions no. That’s a dumb and crazy idea. Yo I want \"l is real 2401\" sign in HD please Actually, contrary to popular belief it actually says eternal star (same sign is also used in the original ocarina of time) someone upscaled it to their best ability and it says eternal star. What\\'s weird though is that despite that, luigi was found in the games source code exactly 24 years and 1 month after 64\\'s release. I came here for one thing\\nTo know if we would be able to control the camera in 64 with the other noy stock 2:08 - shhhh... he’s precious and he needs his sleep. -we played 3d allstars!- \\nwe talked about our backstories to the games in 3d allstars! Am I the only that just wanted to see the menu screen of 3D Allstars Wow I am surprised this much people also wanted to see the menu screen, thanks for the likes and comments :) No AlanE14 THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN WANDERING THIS WHOLE TIME I honestly wanted to as well No Petition to put galaxy 2 on switch. Cant wait to Lets Play this Legendary Games again or better to play them again! 👍🏻❤ Love this game. Definitely gonna buy it. I\\'d love to get the remasters but there almost out of stock everywhere. \\n\\n*Use this comment as a announce a restock button* Other than amazon its still in stock. @Daniel Pruitt bruh Idk where you are for 1, and for 2 just like wait for the physical copies to release lol. @HUED I dislike digital games. I almost exclusively get physical games just buy it digitally, stop feeding into fake inflation Gay Bowser: Who are you?\\nBi Bowser: I\\'m you but better More like worse Totally lost here lol The virgin Bowsette vs the chad Bowser Michael Deypalubos No @Boltizar LMAOOOO godlike reply Never played any of these games. Can’t wait! \"Excitement intensifies\" For me it\\'ll be my first time of the three games D: I\\'m very excited for playing For some reason, when I was watching this episode, I felt Krysta was about to burst into tears throughout the video, several times. Hope all is well with her. March 31st be like\\n\"We don\\'t play Super Mario 3d All-Stars\" @Deadsea1993 Gaming damn, never seen someone that really didn\\'t like anything about PS or Xbox Galaxy 2: First time? It Wont Go Away Then You Just Cant Buy Then @S . Yeah, but you know scalpers will eat it up and it will be hard to find cause 3D World has been the most requested Wii U port for awhile and it is the one I\\'ve missed the most. As for money, I\\'m not rich. I just worked a lot at a car factory and put in lots of overtime cause I enjoyed the work. I\\'d put stuff like The Isley Brothers on the radio and start building the brakes. @Deadsea1993 Gaming 3D World isn\\'t limited to March 31st. I wish I had that kind of money lol. I remember I was playing Mario sunshine when I was little and the water made me pee myself. But the problem was when I peed I took off my pants and broke the GameCube..... Nintendo: We played our own game!\\nMe I sure hope you did! We Played Super Mario 3D All-Stars!\\nMe: Watch the video\\nAlso me: I\\'ve paused my Super Mario 64 PC Port gameplay for this? 0:08 *(3D intensifies)* Nintendo is finally understanding how to use memes A random user On a website the jokes don’t make any sense lmao @Zeyo didn\\'t even see you guys we\\'re talking about the meme thing or whatever\\n\\nAnyways, atleast Nintendo\\'s Getting... Somewhere. @Zeyo This guy gets it @A random user On a website It\\'s usually cringe because it has a cynical element of a soulless corporate entity saying \"Haha we\\'re relatable! Buy product!\" I wouldn\\'t say this instance was particularly egregious. Maybe you could argue the format of \"x intensifies\" is a dead meme? But honestly, I hadn\\'t even thought about it till OP pointed it out. @Blue Water what \"Everyone has their happy place, and mine is Shiverburn Galaxy.\"\\n-Scott Wozniak @Original the Character Do not Steal it\\'s a joke dude CEO of Irrelevancy CEO of Irrelevancy I thought he sold his pass so he could afford his 433 copies of wii play @Original the Character Do not Steal shhhhhhhhure.... @CEO of Irrelevancy Ok but does he have the N word pass? @Original the Character Do not Steal he never got his V-Card, \\'cause of Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast. I’m starting chronologically with Super Mario 64! Nintendo: tries to edit funny haha memes like slow part with (3D intensifies) to be epic meme YouTube channel\\nMe: wtf does (3D intensifies) even mean I remember when I was younger that I was unable to get past the bee mario part in sm galaxy. Now that I have more gaming experience, I will surely beat that part. ',\n",

But still ice cream is great. @Parinita ikr Dua injects quality in everything she does The problem I\\'m seeing in Ice cream from everyone is the lyrics.

She rise regardless. You, yes you...That woman lives inside of you...It\\'s time you meet her and share her with the world...Share her amazing talents and creativity...It\\'s time to RISE...See you at the top😉🤗.

Yeah👌 I came from home , not tiktok Богдан Резнік hi there! I noticed your name and not sure if you can read this (I’m sorry if I offended you) but TikTok is a social media platform which people can create fun videos but of course every fan base had weird people so if you get this be careful! What is TikTok? *I pray whoever reads this becomes successful* They really should’ve retitled this song “I Should’ve Stayed At Home”.

       " '\"gave the dog five scents\"\\nwhat the hell are they going to do with a nickel?\\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\n*cries tears of stupidity* SAME Panzerfaust same Haha thats what I thought Same Yep. Me too. separated for four minutes -> friendly greeting\\nseparated for four hours -> excited greeting\\nseparated for four days -> pee everywhere Separated for a week:\\n\\nDestroy house My dogs seperated four minutes Frantic greeting, four hours franitic greeting four days holy Shyte greeting lol closed bathroom door insestant crying lol, meaning I am not allowed to go to the bathroom alone :p When i would deploy, my dog would stop eating after a couple weeks and mope around. I would have to call home and my family would hold the phone to his ear and i would talk to him. After that he knew I was around and he would go back to eating. I have had him for 15 years now, and I wouldnt trade them for all the money in the world. @Brawl Stars Fights! Legends never die smh. @Brawl Stars Fights! Dude... He must be dead by now. @crotchrocket00 I agree!  Because my dog is my constant companion,  he is the most important thing in my life.  Of course I have family whom I love (but they are thousands of miles away) and I have friends (but their work schedule is the opposite of mine), but my dog is always with me and the bond is very strong.  Additionally he has such a happy personality he makes me happy and when I am not well or feeling down, he is extra attentive.  I wouldn\\'t trade my dog for all the money in the world either. I thought the sentence was \"they gave dogs 5 cents\" and for the split second it took you to explain that sentence my mind was completely confused and wondering why dogs would care about money. lmao Im so happy I belong to this little community of confusion. Me too lol 😂 I shook people do like me WAHAHAHAHA LMAO NOT NOT NOT NOT ME TOO In our superior human language, we pronounce two completely unrelated things the same way :P It\\'d be nice if you also mention the story of Hachiko, the dog that waited at the train station everyday for his owner to return to despite the owner himself already passed away. I watched 2 sad dogs movies in a row before a photoshoot that didn’t go too well ryoga316 yes They\\'re both together now, R.I.P both of them. ryoga316 thanks so much I totally agree!!! And he kept coming years after that my dog still misses me.\\n\\nBUT HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER! Lol gravity falls Nice Her aim is getting better! My dog died last November after 13 years of living together with me. I still miss him... My dog Got Scared at a rainy Night on Springbreak he got scared at night so he ran away and to this day whatever day you are reading this I still miss him ALOOOOOT @Malak Rhazali Thank you! im so sorry for your miss dogs are social creatures... And humans are also social beings... And as sharing those same traits of course there are going to be similarities... Dogs miss and grieve for each other... It is natural and part of nature... And yes if the dog loves you and has a special close true bond with you, they will miss you and will grieve for you if you do not show up for a long period of time... They need the companionship and love as much as we need them..  I want to just end this with... remember,... They are never JUST a dog... And I really wish people would stop looking at dogs as property or furniture.. I wish people would stop calling them pets, and start treating them as companions with feelings a hear a mind and a SOUL as well as a living being..  Hey dogs could look at us as hairless ape monsters that chatter and scream a lot... But they don\\'t.. The see us as friends.. We should really learn from that.. My Nugget has been my son since day one that he rested his little head on my shoulder to tell me “take me home please”. My life has never been the same. He is my pride and joy! orangie84 you...use...elipses...too...much... Our dogs do see us as the one\\n                        \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n :O I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN You lost me at the 5 cents. What exactly did they buy with them? Pedro Nascimento well...Make it sound like a joke since the only joke right know is you Pedro Nascimento can\\'t blame him when you legit sound stupid instead of trying to make a joke. Lmao @zaproid You\\'re ruining my joke. I feed my kids with internet points. Stop killing my kids! Not cents. A scent or otherwise known as a distinctive smell. Example: The milk is rotten, the foul scent cave it away. So like we, humans, can use scents to examine our surroundings to, for example, see if something is edible, dogs can do the same, but to a higher degree thanks to their better noses. Dogs actually use mostly smell to identify people and other dogs or animals. So they cave the dogs 5 scents to sniff during the experiment. In short: the english language is funky, trust me, it fooled me at first as well. What a crazy video. Who has a land line these days??? @anubis2814 LOL!!  I do!!  And what\\'s funny,  if I have ordered food and the delivery person phones that they are at the front of my building, I say \"okay, I\\'m coming down to get it\", my dog immediately turns around and stares at the door before I even prepare to get the food.  He knows that the phone ringing and me saying that phrase means that I\\'m leaving for a bit and coming back.  He doesn\\'t react to my cell phone whatsoever. subscribed😃   I found your channel from the shout-out on \"its okay to be smart.\" To you and all the other creators that make well researched, entertaining educational videos: Thank You!!

I sincerely appreciate that:-) I love your dog <3\\n\\nI thought this video would break my heart (because I thought the title automatically implied a \"no\" answer), but instead it gave me warm fuzzies <3 Fry\\'s Seymour dog anyone? *direct on the feels* +Niller Symphony nowhere near crispy enough +Niller Symphony Hachiko If dogs need higher framerate to perceive motion in videos, does that mean the act of them watching TV is just a misunderstanding? With regards to the statements starting at 2:35. No, research says there\\'s a link between body size, metabolism rate and visual processing speed. There is no magical thing about humans that makes them especially slow at visual processing.\\n\\nSecondly, there is no feeling of slow-mo for animals because that would mean the animal is seeing things at slower speed than they are happening. That\\'s impossible. Instead what happens at a higher visual processing speed is just that, more frames per second. You get to see things that normally would be a blur for animals with slower visual processing speeds.\\n\\nOh, and the flickering of the videos, no, it would just look choppy, like a low fps game. There would be no blackouts. Remember, higher and lower visual processing rates just indicate fps really, and there\\'s nothing special about humans that magically makes them shittier at visual processing like the video implies. It\\'s about body size and metabolism. Hello, this is dog. I enjoyed the video. I don\\'t know if you are aware that the behind the scenes video is listed as private. Looks like a labradoodle. But I maybe wrong :D +BrainCraft what is ur dogs breed, she beautiful 😀 +BrainCraft lol Thanks! I accidentally upload a 15 second video of Luna chewing instead of the real thing. It\\'s live now:\\xa0http://youtu.be/eEJXfzUs3nY Have they done this study on humans yet though? I mean, would a kid miss a parent that never fed them or treated them terribly, and not miss them, whereas they would miss a person that fed and sheltered them. Dont we almost always only miss people because theyve given us a positive expereience in the past, wheter its sex, food or being taken care of. Would those same parts of the brain light up as the dogs, like when say, i go to my moms house only because i know theyre having pizza? Isnt associating positive feelings with someone really the same as loving or missing them, or at least similar.  Ok, but...why is she holding half a brain in the middle of a park? Very interesting! And Luna is adorable :) Having seen some of the videos on YouTube, where a dog is returned to its loving family after a long separation... I\\'m pretty damn sure those dogs were happy about the reunion... (err.... wimpering with ecstatic joy would be more like it. Do they miss us? You BET they miss us.)Search: *\"Dog reunites with original owners and cries.\"*\\n\\n(At this point I would normally\\xa0paste\\xa0the link, but YouTube is misbehaving again, and will not let me. I do not know why it does this, but sometimes it goes into a sulk.) @Bash Cat Yup! Got it.\\xa0Forward slash watch. @Bash Cat OK. I\\'ll try that in future. Thanks for the hint... (kind of you).\\xa0 my dog when he was a pup was able to \"tell time.\" If you told him \"i need to be up at 8 o\\'clock\" at 7:59 he would scratch at the door of your bedroom (or give you kisses if your door was open), and it would work at any morning time. we never really experimented with it and he is no longer allowed upstairs so we dont know if he still does it, but I was never sure how he was so on the nose each time with no training. I don\\'t think you can say what time to wake up lol but my old dog used to know when I would get up there were times when I would forget to put on and alarm say around 8.00 I\\'m the morning he would scratch at the door or bark waiting outside the door at around the same timeonly a few minutes off so I think they have a certain degree of time but can\\'t put my finger on how he knew to a point Xanderqwerty123   I\\'m calling bullshit on this one. there is a theory that dogs \"tell time\" because of the amount smell we leave behind, diminishes over time. Their sense of smell is so acute and they can make correlations, so that they can learn to anticipate when their master returns, because it is when his/her lingering scent has dropped under a certain level, and they come back. (Sorry for the broken grammar, it,s late, I\\'m dead tired) That is frickin amazing 👌🏼 can you teach my dog that But how would they see a video with 48 or 60 FPS? PC MASTER RACE. +Rodrigo Appendino yeah, that was really blury - so the way dogs perceive images, are more like modern cameras? ...or ? i need answers too ;) +Rodrigo Appendino Or even 100 FPS 0:55\\n\\nOh, I thought the guy paid dogs 5 cents to do things!😂 Does the image processing rate also mean that dogs experience our house lights as flickering? HAHAHAHA The \"Hello, this is dog\" at the end made me explode in laughter xD my dog barks at other dogs on the tv, so he can see whats on the screen, your science is flawed. David T they hear it usually Tavis S \\nI\\'m so sorry for you and your family is that sad 😭? I have a dog I love and the people around me can prove my dog misses me. I\\'m only around my dog half the time and when I get back people say things like \"He\\'s just not the same when you\\'re away.\" And \"He\\'s really sad for most the time you\\'re not here.\" Over the years, I\\'ve learned that none of my three cats care how long I was gone. All they care about is upon my return they get food. But do they really miss us? Or do they miss us giving them food and walks? That would be a valid question. \\nHowever, how do you know your parents miss you ? Because they tell you -might be the answer. \\nBut because dogs don\\'t answer the same way we do there are problems. \\n\\nSo lets look at it.\\nYou could try out and have a dog go on a vacation and have a stranger feed them. - nothing more nothing less. \\nMy hypothosis is that eventhough he is beeing fed and cared, once you come home, your dog will greet you with joy. (experianced with my own dog) \\n\\nAnother way to look at it is by extrapolation. When observing other humans you will notice some behavior, which you might interpret. For example looking in a mirror and fixing their hair. Now how do you know they recognise themself in the mirror and its not just a random behavior? \\nYou extrapolate your knowlage about yourself and other humans to come to the conclusion that the fixing of the hair indicated that the person regocnised itself. \\nSame for other mamels - in this case the dog. \\nThere were experiments done, looking at behavior and reaction to the brain when given a sent of a \"loved one\". Threfore you can conclude they miss them and not just the food providing system that is you. \\n\\nLet me ask you, do you realy miss your spouse or parent? or du you just miss beeing around somebody you can talk to, have sex with or someone who provides shelter ?\\n\\nNow to be clear I don\\'t want to humanise dogs, but to  give a bit of an explenation on just because communication isn\\'t always direct an clear there are ways we can extrapolate bahavior which we thought were \"only human\" to other animals and get to know how similar different mamels are. \\n\\nA little funny sidenote. Crows are known to recognise specific people by face and distinguish between a friendly face and a harmful one. A trait we long always just thought to be known to mamels -but now is discoverd in other animal species as well. Sage Fire   Exactly. She never seems to actually answer the question in her videos or provide much actual information. My family\\'s dog is also named Luna :) Great video - and your dog looks so sweet! Loved this video. :3\\n\\nThank you, Braincraft.\\xa0\\n\\n*Thumbs up for effort, quality and content* I had a dog he knew  what time i got home  and when I went to work he ran into the neighbors yard  but five minuets before i got home he ran back into his yard. I love dogs so much. It\\'s just a being of pure love. 2:15 Of course time affects it, they just feel like they\\'ve been waiting forever after 2-4 hours, since they can\\'t read our clocks. and one week the dog tries to hug me and try to knock me down 0:58 lol when she said they gave the dogs \"5 scents\" I thought she said 5 cents, like they paid the dogs a freaking nickel Lmao Probably should have talked about military dogs reuniting after months apart. A little testing with that kind of scenario would go a long way toward showing if they miss us! There is no way those soldiers are getting the same greeting they would have gotten after only hours or days. The extra time absolutely made a difference! The dogs often remain with a second owner (significant other), so it is genuinely the person they missed so much and not the difference between contact with a familiar person vs contact with an owner. I dont like socializing, No FOMO I love your dog he\\'s so cute I love the dog in this video.....oh be still my heart! What a cutie pie! My dog has an unusual response to a certain recording.  Whenever I put on \"If I Had You\" from the cd, Benny Goodman Today, she starts whining and scratching at the hall door with an occasional yelp.  It\\'s a soft, easy-going tune.  She doesn\\'t do this as much with any other recording.  Thinking it might have been Goodman\\'s clarinet, I tried other recordings.  Nothing.  I tried his recording of the Mozart clarinet concerto.  Nothing.  She\\'s funny. +Soda Bear and Polo Bear To do it in time, that\\'s a very unique dog.  Saw a cockatiel bounce in time. 2:44 thanks for the seizure warning... I know that if I leave for two hours vs a couple days my dogs are always more excited to see me I really love your voice! So fitting for the type of videos you make, so keep up the good work. I really love your voice! So fitting for the type of videos you make, so keep up the good work. It depends on the individual dog. Some dogs will actually miss \"you\" as where some dogs will just not like the fact they\\'re alone and/or missing out. When I came back from work my cat is so excited and comes to the door purring, no matter how long we have out. Ps: Luna is darn cute, and those eyes! <3 Really well made. She sounds like the person on the news talking that a lab-doodle?(if thats even a thing) I love your videos, guys! It\\'s been 3 months since I\\'ve seen my dog since I left for the military. I was told he got depressed and waited at my bedroom door for me :( 2:45 epileptic warning ⚠️ 🚨 I work and come home every other day. I got stuck staying out an extra night and my dog greeted me with even more  ferver  than the usual very happy to see me. I believe they are aware of time in their sense. I left my 2 cats alone in the house while I went on holidays for 8 days, with plenty food and their window open so they could go in and out. I left water too but they don\\'t drink water for some reason. I live in the countryside. When I came back they had different \\'meows\\'. They\\'re both female and their meows had changed to that of a tomcat, a deep long kind of threatening a meow; I heard it as I came up to the house. I thought there was a cat-party going on or something, but I suspect they changed it to keep other cats, and threats, away.\\n\\nThey were kind of cautious of me for the first few minutes after I came back, not scared or anything, more like they couldn\\'t believe it I was back again, and a little confused, but they went back to normal fairly quickly. They\\'d only eaten about 5 of the 10 bowls of food I\\'d left them, and they seemed fatter for some reason. :-)\\n\\nAlso, cats seem to be a lot \\'cooler\\' than dogs when you go away and come back again, sometimes they even seem to give you a dirty look, while dogs are jumping up trying to lick you all over. I should mention though, that for a few days afterwards they were both constantly taking turns jumping up on my lad, which they hardly ever do usually! It\\'s like every cue ever from any dog was ignored in the making of this My Thai aunt\\'s two dogs do jump on my family it does mean they miss us😂 Music name pls\\nBtw awesome video, makes me love dogs even more :3 Think back to your earliest memories when you were 2 or 3. That’s the closest you’ll get to living the day to day experience of a dog. yes, they do miss you, and many will develop separation anxiety. I worked in a veterinary clinic, and even adopted a dog with a bad past with separation anxiety, IT IS A REAL THING! Thank you. i really hope my dog cooper misses me. my dog cooper was sent into my grandpa and my grandmas house after chewing our slippers. when i go there and see my dog he jumps on me and he keeps on crying. now covid is now outside and we are in quarantine. i reallhy hope he wont forget me. My dog definitely misses me when I\\'m gone! She will just sleep and pout when I\\'m at work all day, even if the rest of the family is home. And forget going out of town... if I\\'m gone for more than a couple of days she gets a rash!\\n\\nLuna! (pets with mouse) I haven\\'t even looked at this and can answer \\n\\nYes.. they so needy \\n\\nCats just get on with it When ur gone for 1 second u come back cuz u left ur phone the says omg what took u soooooooo long Whenever I cook ramen in the micro machine, I share with my dog. So every time 3 minutes is about to come around on the clock, he starts yelling and screaming at me to go get the ramen before the clock is over love the triceratops badge :) 2:20 Those sockets don\\'t look very safe... My mom\\'s dogs will greet her with love every time she comes back home.   Definitely... having spent months away from home then coming back to our collie going absolutely ballistic for at least half an hour has convinced me of this. I miss my dog too much I haven’t seen my dogs for months My dog would always know what time my brother and I would get home from school. That or he just knew the sound of the bus and would know it was us lol. Damn I miss him Do dogs have the hormone oxytocin or some analog? When my mom leaves for work one of my dogs always starts howling. Then after about 5 minutes, he gets my other dog howling. Also, if my dog (he is passive, and doesnt hunt) sees something out the window, he will bark to let my other dog (she is extremely aggressive and will literally go after anything that moves that is not a person) know that something is there and she will run over. its kinda cute. They dont miss us they arent happy they are worried about survival because we bring them food and they cant tell if we will just let them starve vinzer72frie What about when you leave, but another person is still home with them to takes care of all of that stuff? Dogs are still excited to see their human in those situations. My dog is counting time for shure, he wants me to feed him on time, even if he already got a big treat not that long ago, so he can\\'t have hungry at that time. Also I\\'ve heard from a housemate that he just waits for me and starts standing at the door about 10min before I come home. Maybe not all dogs are like him but he is very intuitive and clever. my dog sits at the window staring for HOURS waiting for mom to come back, yeah they miss us Does anyone else have regular conversations with their dog? Cannon Fodder me How come one of my dogs responds and can see images on the tv however my other dog dose not? ive been switching between this video and the one you told me to check out for 8 hours can i stop now 😦 Hello ?This is dog !That was awesome :-) Now i\\'m in a loop going from it\\'s ok to be smart to this channel I feel really sad watching this video. I recently moved away to go to college and if everything I left behind (including my parents) I miss my dog the most. She is my everything. I don\\'t know how I\\'ll go on without her. :( I got an ad for this channel before watching this I remember hearing about one study that hypothesized that dogs tell time by smell. To test this, they had the owner walk out of the room to go to work. Usually, the dog would jump at the owner every time he came home after being gone for hours. What the scientist did was wave the owner\\'s sweaty clothes around every so often. This kept the owner\\'s smell from dissipating. When the owner came home, the dog reacted as though he had only been gone for a little while. The dog could\\'t tell that the owner had been gone for hours because his smell was still around. ........you\\'re beautiful. before I watch I\\'m going to answer\\nYES. yes dogs miss us. my dog freaked out when I took a trip to Texas from Florida to help my patents and sun move back to Ga. a month later when my fiancé and Ginger our 1½ old pit bull picked me up at the Orlando airport she Ginger for real excited and peed all over our seat. when I first left Bobby, my fella said she would not eat and started peeing in the house. (she house trained) now me and Ginger are inseparable. she is with me almost everywhere I go\\n but she also loves her \\'daddy\\'. when he took a weekend trip to Ga to help his uncle move his wife\\'s side back to Florida Ginger didn\\'t act too sad during the day but at night she would wait by the van for Bobby to show up. (we were recently homeless sleeping in our van up until a few weeks ago.) so we both missed him but a couple days later when we went to pick him up, bobby came up to the driver side door and said, \"HEY BABY!!\" \\nGinger, In the drivers seat, started prancing her feet up and down, wagging her little butt and make this face I\\'ve never seen. like she was smiling. she then jumps on me to get to bobby and licks his face. when I opened the for to let her or she happy peed all over herself then she settled down. put her head down like she was embarrassed. or baby girl thought she was in trouble. I love our dog and she loves us unconditionally. I don\\'t think this video will deny a dogs ability to miss us but just In case it does ( like another video I once watched) I thought I\\'d throw my .02¢ in. \\nnow let\\'s see what you guys have to say on the subject. I went away on holiday for 5 days and when I came home my dog (she was fed by friend) went absolutely nuts because she was so happy to see me again, she wouldn\\'t leave me for about 5-10 minutes Wait, if their perception of images and video and well pretty much seeing anything is different - can they enjoy music? This faster image they have has to be somehow connected to the audio as well, so is music strange and flickering etc. for them too? every time when i come home from school my dog doesn\\'t care but when my dad gets home he gets so happy that he runs to the door does that mean he doesn\\'t like me? I like the ceratopsian thing on your shirt. What if I slow it to 0.75 and max greets me every day after school jumpS on my leg and is very happy 2:45 Thanks for the nightmare. i also found out my dog can remember the times i do certain things when i get back at my normal time hes sleeping by the door, but when i came 1 hour earlier he was still sleeping on my bed as usual when i normally go to sleep the couch to my bed when im gonna make dinner on normal time he walks to the kitchen an lays there etc, i feel like they are really good at knowing when something is but arent that good in knowing length of time like how much time passes I left my dog for 1 minute came back he got so happy for some reason, and that\\'s why my dog looks like he doesn\\'t really like youtube videos what a fluffy doggo :-) Interesting topic :) I\\'d love to see a video about this but about cats (as I really want to believe my kitty misses me as much as I miss her !) dogs cant miss my brother cause he cannot live a day getting mad at a simple mistake ',\n",

Tbh I think a new movie would do more harm than good. Just let him rest and read his work, continuing to live in his art. I wish God blessed me with such beauty. He\\'s sooooo gorgeous 😍 What makes him even more admirable is how well spoken he actually is. @You stole my burrito, Charlie because his south node is virgo. And he\\'s 10000% soo humble and down to earth \"I want something edgier...

LMFAO He’s like a real life prince 😩😍he’s so handsome Way to Mars Yes, turd. Get lost. You’re rude and annoying as fuck. I don’t scare you. If I did, you’d mind your own fucking business instead of continuing to harass and troll me. I’m basing my opinion of Eric off of what I’ve seen and learned about Eric online. I am not dumb. I don’t know Eric and can’t judge him entirely off of a few things that he has said online or on how he has acted on film. However, I just feel I’ve seen enough to think the negative way I do about him. I’m sure he has good qualities too, but I’ve seen a lot of bad ones. How am I immature? What is wrong with you? You act way more immature than me.This is why I feel like Eric may not be a very good person. When Eric was about 17, he commented on Twitter, something like “You should just let people end their life and not stop them from killing themselves” and “I wanna get raped.” Does a good person say things like that? What he said was evil and sick. Get a life. How the fuck am I scaring you, dumbass? All I said was why I don’t like Eric. How is that scary? Eric also just asked the comment, “what’s your opinion about gay people using the f***ot word?” He’s a judgmental, dumb, arrogant fool. Esmerella Honeymoon Yeah. I agree. I hope Eric treats Cody well, but I don’t know much about him. @Leanne Rey No girl. You\\'re imature af. You\\'re literally scaring me. Why tf you\\'re acting like you personally know these people? @Redlove❤ Do we see the same person? He looks like one of the angels from Greek painting. LJR 87 I don’t really know much of Eric I don’t see him anywhere I hope he treats Cody right 🥺 *\"this is a \"women\\'s wear\" jacket. but i\\'m a man, and i\\'m wearing it. so it\\'s a men\\'s jacket.\"*\\n\\nPREACH\\nthough clothes don\\'t have genders. i argue with my mom sometimes because i find like a flannel or a jacket cool and she will say \"that\\'s for boys\" i ain\\'t mad but like-- if you think something looks good on you, buy it! clothes having genders is just pointless. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 @Way to Mars No, you stop. All of them here have conveyed their points through sound reasoning. You don\\'t get to shut people\\'s opinions down because you disagree or don\\'t understand them. @Raziya Aziz Omfg shut up. Stop making everything so complicated. What he meant was that style doesn\\'t have gender. Just stop. I agree that no one should tell you what to wear. I also agree with Caitlyn, the other person who replied to this. I think clothes have genders because they are made different to fit the bodies. But clothes shouldn’t have genders based on who wants to wear them. sorry but i disagree a little. women tend to need wider thigh area in pants and tend to need for in the butt area. Also womens shirts are a bit slimmer and wider at the top (to leave room for boobs). Usually, the difference in womens and mens clothes are there because of style (women like high waist more than men, men like less fringes/etc) and because of the cut of the clothing. I am a girl and personally cant fit any mens pants properly. But i think for things like jackets and stuff, gender neutral makes more sense. He looks good in everything, that\\'s hard to pull off for most people. exactly what I was thinking, he is so beautiful and graceful that he can pull it off.  he can look fantastic in anything @Reek Rodriqguez v @Shakayla Rainey https://youtu.be/aN-UCTNOK6k Agreed https://youtu.be/XqGRbShZzaI Nike free he is literally one of the most beautiful men that I have ever seen. You got that right!!! Such mesmerizing blue eyes....Idc if I am old enough to be his mama, he evokes these unmaternal feelings in me.....😍😍😍😍😍😍 I am genuinely sad that he isn\\'t and never will be my boyfriend. @Ashley DaRonche Girl.... stop it. Don\\'t feed their delusion. No one\\'s delusion for that matter. @Zack D Yeah. The guy beside him in the car is his boyfriend. @Zack D he has a boyfriend. But I think everyone says he is bi. @yumisue na how do i not know this i fully support this with my whole heart LMAO i mean he\\'s actually pansexual.. so we do have a chance ladies. But i doubt that, cause he\\'s in a really loving and happy relationship with Eric Smith. They both look like a snacc, so I don\\'t blame them for dating each other HAHAHA imagine being this insanely gorgeous @Ms. Valdez let us simp in peace pls Ms. Valdez ok you got me 😭😭 @Darth Maul dont what me you already deleted your comment😂😂 it was very simpish Ms. Valdez what? Fr I found him in American horror story. He went from playing the Antichrist to an aerobics teacher... He\\'s amazing!! And I know he has many other roles too but my goodness... He\\'s super talented... And super charming... I will always love him... allie biersack he was ASTOUNDING in The Assassination of Gianni Versace watch him on american crime story versace, his best performance a d was robbed from an emmy nom at least Same way i found him. It was in AHS:1984 that I was like omg he is gorgeous! I love him!!! Yes to this comment just checking the comments to make sure that i\\'m not the only one that wants him to DESTroy me Clothing should not have a gender. We all need clothes, who cares what type we choose to cover ourselves? i disagree. womens shirts and mens shirts are different for a reason, women need area in the top for boobs, slimmer in the torso because of smaller waist. Most guys have a wider waist in proportion to chest than women. Same thing with jeans. Women have wider thighs, waist, and bigger butt, so we tend to have different cut of jeans than guys. If you can fit their clothes, great good for you, but for most people, that isnt the case. I like that they put a womens or mens label because i know i am more likely to fit womens clothes. and i know that it is more likely to be my style @Archons really? With that type of mentality we would go back to being animals, what’s next money should have no value ? We make those society norms for a reason. @truth be getting told you remind of a preacher. the bad kind @truth be getting told  Literally what are you trying to achieve here?? Let people wear what they want and chill out, it\\'s just clothes. Cody Fern is the king of style. Plus, he’s so gorgeous & talented & charming. Seriously cannot get enough of him. Can he be a spokesmodel for everything? @Brandon Roberts No he\\'s Australian. Jeez...his accent is a big clue 😆 https://youtu.be/eVFlr1rIghU Luis witton free He is latino because is argentine Free Louis Vuitton There\\'s something otherworldly about Cody - something elusive but powerful at the same time. He seems like the gentlest person on Earth but laced with immense internal force that draws you in. Cody emanates with this hipnotizing kind of elvish/divine/alien aura that\\'s just irresistible. Yesss so true you just put my every thought about him into words also I think that’s what makes him so good at acting that personality trait makes him able to play any character and his art is amazing because of it Because he is south node is virgo north node is pisces. Mix in earth and otherwordly. this is exactly how i feel about him Yes to the point where you cant take your eyes off him! can we please appreciate how beautiful cody and eric together? so inspiring. literally in tears rn. so so so proud! ischaffee google ‘Cody Fern and Eric’ then how come I saw that he had a girlfriend... @Fernanda Mascote it´s his boyfriend since 2016 Are they dating?? @A B they look so cute together 😍 Those eyes, I\\'ll never get over how beautiful those eyes are. Everything he says: \\n\\nMe: 🤩😍🥰😍😍😍🥰😘🥰🥰😍🥰 He leaves me speechless with his otherworldly beauty...SIGH He looks so royal I love how fast he comes up with stories based off his clothes when he said “you can’t move your arms if you have broad shoulders” I FELT THAT Laya Riser i\\'ve never felt this proud to have broad shoulders 😭😭 Darth Maul ma’am? Laya Riser hahaha felt that too Laya Riser get off your phone 1:10 Cody, your inner Michael is showing Also it shows when he puts on the cape 😋 I just laughed at his laugh the way he laughs 😆😂 yea I think.. he says what Michael London who say.. lol I hope someone contacts him or he contacts them because he would make an incredible Lestat in The Vampire Chronicles. From the clothes, words, thoughts... Perfect!!! He\\'d make a better Armand omg YESSS YESSSSS!!!! HAIL LESTAT!!!! No he should be Marius 😭 Cody: *coughs in turtle neck*\\nMe: “is that allowed?” i adore cody! can’t even tell how proud i am :’) he’s the most beautiful human being on earth. so much love for him. “Okay Billie Eilish” “that was very Billie “ Me: AHHHHHHHH YOU DONT KNOW HOW HARD I SCREAMED ON THE INSIDE... i IMMEDIATELY FELL Yup adeline burgess ahahahaha Kyle CampBEE that’t pretty much my EXACT reaction HNDSJJDFJJDDJDJ Hi I love Cody so much and I’m so proud of him. He’s my definition of beautiful inside out. This does mean a lot to me. Thank you LV for doing this with him. I LOVE this gentleman and his work, specifically, in American Horror Stories: Apocalypse.  He is so talented and beautiful and I hope to see his work in the future! Thank you for this. More intelligent people should be in the spotlight. Hes SO beautiful as a man that is searching for his own sense of masculinity that kind of video with people, particularly other young men speaking their mind about masculinity and wear whatever makes you feel ok it\\'s really inspired When you\\'re as pretty as him you can wear whatever you want and always look good. \"What?\"\\n\"I wanna wear it!\" The love and _respect_ i have for this man.... i can\\'t even put it in to words at this point *\"look at all of the jewels i\\'ve collected from all of the kingdoms that i\\'ve conquered.\"*\\n\\nTHIS CRACKED ME UP AHAHAHA IT\\'S 4AM\\nI LOVE THIS MAN He\\'s absolutely breathtaking, @10:55 I nearly died This guy is a real one. Proud of him and how far he\\'s come and how inspiring he is to so many. That all leather look 🤤 Knowing that Cody came from rural Western Australia, around an hour out from myself, makes me proud. Makes me feel like anything is possible Bro yess!!!! Everything is possible indeed, go for it!!! The issue with men wearing women’s wear is that it isn’t designed for a mans figure. @Ethan, generally yes. but taking a closer look at it though, there are men who can still wear women\\'s clothing because of their body types, & likewise women. there are men of feminine body types & so are women having athletic body types. above just \\'self-expression\\', a clothing should be designed with both sexes in mind. except only if a certain \\'client\\' wishes otherwise. :) Same with suits! I wanted to get a suit for my last day in school. The suits again didn\\'t matched with my figure. eric is literally gorgeous I just realized he’s there with him in the car Is it me or does he look like a young Andrew McCarthy. 🤔 Im with you on that. I just love the way cody speaks, he\\'s so eloquent without sounding snobby or pretentious at all and I love that photo of yours And you know what’s so smart about Fern’s look? It’s that you only have one, beautiful article of fabric to focus on, while the rest of the clothing is like a clean and monochromatic background that accentuates its’ exoticism. Simple, but effective. I love that about fashion. And I love Cody Fern🥰 my heart stopped every time I saw his smile-- I’ve watched him from Gianni Versace Murder case on Netflix i like him! Fashion shouldn’t be afraid of what society to tell you what to wear or not well infact your 1st outfit is confident a 💯% as long as you carry yourself and rock it! since 2014 loving fashion - genderless is my motto. I’m a man but even wear a Chanel dress layer it with jeans and pullover cashmere sweater. Fashion 2020 are androgynous, genderless, unique. This is it! He is the limelight example of people like us! this is a celebration of fashion! 😍👏🏼🖤💎✨✨✨✨✨✨ Love this guy, honestly so chilled, so funny, looks good with anything, love him this was inspiring on so many levels,, i loved to hear about Cody\\'s views on fashion especially in relation with gender!! Ever since apocalypse I’ve been lowkey scared of him 😑 He looks incredible in anything. Guys this is the reason y girls take so long to dress up It’s just wear what you wanna wear. I love it👍🏽 Well imagine this beautiful, fey, elegant, charming and well-spoken. Can\\'t relate. Cody Fern is a divine creature I love the way he talks<333 He\\'s such an inspiring person. He reminds me michael hutchence I just love him. Nothing more to say. The way he talks and thinks about genders and that it doesn\\'t matter what you wear, as long as you feel like yourself, is beautiful. And he is so right about that!❤ GOD please have him and Mr styles having a nice conversation together thank you very much Cody fern is absolutely gorgeous inside and out, it’s breathtaking. Im so so proud of him 🥺 i’m in love with cody omg he makes anything look so good 🥺 The end of this was my favorite, because it was fun and silly. :-) I Stan super hard forever for him now. Amazing fashion taste, and an impeccable actor. I love it, I love- him. I\\'m for sure in love with him... i just love him. I’m in love with Cody. Such an inspiration of mines.♥️ When he said billie eilish...\\n\\nMe:\\nSO ICONIC 😍😭🥺 I haven’t seen someone so uniquely gorgeous in so long omg PLZ I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, HE IS SO INSPIRING This is the best video i\\'ve seen for a loooong time. #LVFW20 #CodyFern  \\nThank you for sharing this experience. \\nThe chosen cape’s an incredible, must-have piece. Divinely determined, detailed, dreamy and delicate. To be worn often!  🙌🏻 ... so you’re telling me that this is the man who played an antichrist?? \\n\\nim sobbing he’s so pure He’s an amazing person.! 💕 Very cool...!! I have always admired his style and his wisdom. Im obsessed with him he is HOT!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍 He looks like Andrew McCarthy  Pretty in pink 04:43 I\\'m wondering if this is what noémie merlant wore when she was attending césar 2019. And just saw noémie merlant right there attending this too at 6:21. I love love love his laugh and everything about this man ugh He is so unbelievably gorgeous, and after finally watching him not in AHS that’s just a bonus to how adorable and amazing he seems. He does look like a Greek god though I just love how amazing he looks i love it hes like a piece of art Cody fern really does have the most beautiful eyes... Cody: I’m feeling something chill, earthy \\nSees cape *...\\nSo let’s change the narrative.  😂 Im mesmerised by him, I want him in me! Haha calm down Dude is tgat the only thing u like him for I have a feeling. He either bi or gay.. But. I want him straight for meeeee😂😉 He\\'s gay. Case closed. @Sarah VLZ when? Where? @Dumb and Dumber Dunkin donut he is a man NO does he behaves like one no he behaves like a woman POINT @Melike Balta he is a man just because he\\'s gay or pansexual or whatever doesn\\'t have to do with anything @Daenerys Skywalker Dameron yes His eyes are like the deep blue sky I still feel personally victimized by him after all this time. That LV jacket is sick.  2:09 He’s a real life vampire. HIS ACCENT OH PLS HELP god I love him so much :\") He’s one of the most beautiful unique men ever Fact check: He\\'s a vampire Damn, he’s fine. Great bone structure I could wear a cape to the theater,someone will beat me up\\nCalifornia King Cody who conquered all the kingdoms...<3 Or a dragon slayer He would be perfect as Lestat and I can\\'t believe that he\\'s 32, he must be a vampire 😂 I love his cute Aussie accent. He is so adorable ❤️💙 he is gorgeous. A perfect model. 10:27 he\\'s adorable Finally a man who could portray Alexander the great and actually look like him. I said it first! Im in love with him. LOVE EVERYTHING THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING, KEEP UP THE INCREDIBLE WORK He deserves his throne he\\'s worked for 100% and I\\'m so happy for him! Hes so adorable omg! ❤😭❤ he also is so inspiring, I agree that fashion is not for one gender but for all 💛💛 Finally I found somebody else who say this This dude is so beautiful. ',\n",

That\\'s a major right there PhD in physical chemistry here, just wanted to say: Very well done, thank you, I\\'m glad to see quantum chemistry being included. I respect scientists Whenever someone mentions quantum chemistry I get PTSD type flash backs about Gaussian distributions. Hey thanks for all the feedback everyone. There have been a bunch of great comments keeping me in check when I have got things wrong, and loads of people saying they enjoy this content which is very encouraging. Unfortunately I made a few mistakes, so here are a few clarifications. I have also put these in the description. This list is longer than I would like, so I\\'m going to try harder on the next videos to get things perfect! Thanks everyone.\\n\\n1. I got the Oxidising Agent and the Reducing Agent the wrong way around! Sodium is the Reducing agent and Chlorine is the Oxidising agent. My confusion was that when a sodium atom looses an electron it becomes oxidised, so in my simple brain, I called it the oxidising agent. That is wrong because the agent that oxidises the sodium is the chlorine atom and so the labels are the wrong way around. Doh!\\n2. I drew the hydrogen H2 molecule with a double bond but it should be a single bond because they are bonded with a single covalent bond.\\n3. Where I have drawn carbon dioxide, the carbon should have a double bond to each of the oxygens.\\n4. Apparently Feynman diagrams are not that useful for theoretical chemistry, so perhaps that wasn\\'t the best choice for the illustration. The feedback in the comments from a real theoretical chemist is \"All we deal with is shuffling around electrons, but many many many electrons, so a Feynman diagram would need to be huge but at the same time would be very very repetitive.\"\\n5. In analytical chemistry, I should have called it distillation rather than precipitation.\\n6. My definition of organic chemistry being about ‘life’ is not very good. I should have said that organic chemistry looks at compounds that contain carbon. But there are some compounds in inorganic chemistry that also contain carbon, like carbon dioxide so I guess I\\'d also have to state that inorganic chemistry is almost everything else.\\n7. I said that fuels are inorganic chemistry which is misleading when I drew a car next to it. My understanding is that there are inorganic fuels that don\\'t contain carbon, but obviously all the fuels we are familiar with are organic. I thought a picture of a car would tie a few things together elegantly, but it ended up giving the wrong impression. That’s okay, I’m still learning! :D\\n8. In inorganic chemistry, I should have stated that all natural minerals fall under inorganic chemistry so as not to be misleading, otherwise you might go way thinking that only man-made substances fall under inorganic chemistry which is not true. I said that \\'a lot of the inorganic compounds that are studied are man-made\\' meaning that the cutting edge of research is mostly man-made substances.\\n9. Apparently water is not the most inflammable substance. I thought it was so that is interesting.\\n10. In the bonding section, hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces are technically inter molecular forces. someone please tell me why he wouldve made these mistakes i have to do a school slideshow on it Did you corrects these little mistakes on the poster ? Cody from Cody\\'s lab once used steam to make activated charcoal. you\\'re the domain of science, so is there like a range of science as well, if not it should be a thing! Also, spectroscopy is a huge HUGE thing in chemistry; you mentioned it briefly, but should have deserved a lot more air time, especially NMR and infrared spectroscopy. These would fall under the analytical chemistry area. Solvent extractions are also extremely common - the overwhelming majority of syntheses, especially in pharma, require solvent extractions for isolating and purifying your products.\\n\\nAlso, biochemistry can basically be divided into 2 major parts: biomolecules and metabolism. You defined the biomolecules very well but metabolism is equally as important. Metabolism can be divided into 2 parts: catabolic (or breakdown) and anabolic (synthesis) pathways. If most Education were like this, the efficiency in content assimiliation would be astronomic. @Nakarin Thanapongdacha it is a high school curriculum offered by the IBO :) @Peter Nguyen mister, I have interested in every subjects, so can u recommend me some websites to understand these disciplines @Juan Pablo what is IB, mister can u tell me more? Chemistry education IS very much like this. Undergrad chem degrees in US involve introductory gen chem and organic chem courses that provide a good overview of all the subfields in chemistry. The elective courses you take thereafter go deeper into every subfield - usually you\\'re required to take courses in inorganic, analytical, physical (includes thermo, kinetics, and quantum chem), biochemistry, and lab methods and spectroscopy. But this video only demonstrates breadth of chemistry knowledge, not the depth astronomy maybe? @Someone it was a joke... \\nGet over it as It got over your head @monkeyo Archon what is the value of it being interesting when it is fake Astronomy is a branch of physical science along with physics, chemistry, and earth science which all have its sub-branches. @palazzio65 Even then, astronomy is extremely vast on its own. Astronomy is a branch of physics. I do not mind the long gaps between videos if the quality is this damn high. Keep up you\\'re inspiring work.👍 i\\'m very sorry but you mixed up you\\'re (you are) and your (you + someone\\'s) I like to refer to _hydrogen ions_ as *_protons,_* since that is exactly what they are. @Espectador You are right. What I get for not studying and watching YouTube that late @Dys functional two electrons would make hydrogen an anion, and no electrons would make it a cation. (I might very possibly be wrong) I know I\\'m 2 years late but hydrogen ions are protons with 2 electrons. Protons would be hydroxide ions.\\nedit: Scratch that, I got it the other way around No. They are only considered protons in Biology. you can btw look it up pretty easily, the wiki article is quite detailed. There protium (in contrast du deterium and tritium) is explicitly named in the paragraph about \"variations in properties between isotopes\" :) Watching this made me realize how difficult chemistry is. Physics was actually easier for me. where\\'s Nuclear Chemistry? Eh @Symaris \\n\\nHoney bunny, I am chemist and you have obviously not the slightest clue, what you are talking about. So better don\\'t try to talk about stuff that you actually don\\'t understand. @Frank Schneider Nuclear chemistry\\xa0is the sub-field of\\xa0chemistry\\xa0dealing with\\xa0radioactivity, nuclear processes, and transformations in the nuclei of atoms, such as\\xa0nuclear transmutation\\xa0and nuclear properties.\\n\\nIt is the chemistry of\\xa0radioactive\\xa0elements such as the\\xa0actinides,\\xa0radium\\xa0and\\xa0radon\\xa0together with the chemistry associated with equipment (such as\\xa0nuclear reactors) which are designed to perform nuclear processes.\\xa0\\n\\nChemistry\\xa0is the\\xa0scientific discipline\\xa0involved with\\xa0elements\\xa0and\\xa0compounds\\xa0composed of\\xa0atoms,\\xa0molecules\\xa0and\\xa0ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a\\xa0reaction\\xa0with other\\xa0substances.[1][2]\\n\\nIn the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between\\xa0physics\\xa0and\\xa0biology.[3]\\xa0It is sometimes called\\xa0the central science\\xa0because it provides a foundation for understanding both\\xa0basic\\xa0and\\xa0applied\\xa0scientific disciplines at a fundamental level\\n\\n\\nSo, no, It is not a subset of physics, it\\'s a subfield of PHYSICAL SCIENCE like astronomy, geology, etc. Nuclear chemistry is more than physical chemistry, even though, physical chemistry is still being a chemistry field because of chemistry definition. +pyropulse\\nI agree with you, that chemistry is in principle a subset of physics (it\\'s primarily the physics of valence shell electrons), but just in principle. Try describing the behavior of DNA in a strictly physical approach , e.g. in the form of Schrödingers wave function, and we\\'ll see how far you\\'ll get with that approach.\\nFurther nuclear chemistry is far from being primarily focused on isotope purification. That\\'s a pretty trivial and mostly physical process. Nuclear chemistry is, just like a major part of particle physicis, a largely theoretical work based upon quantum mechanics. It focuses e.g. on core stability and core models (and thus the island of stability that you are certainly familiar with). On this level, there is practically no difference anymore between physics and chemistry, physicists and chemists (just like in cellular biology, there is not really a difference between biology and chemistry anymore). The seemingly so obvious borders simply become blurry and disappear into nothingness. +palazzio65\\nNope, nuclear chemistry which deals with the forces and stability of the nucleus is usually part of physical chemistry curriculum. Radioactive elements itself are of cause mostly inorganic, but the discussion of the forces and process and stability of the nucleaus is a part of physical chemistry. The 3 of the 5 types of radioactive decay are quite often discussed as part of general chemsitry of inroganic chemistry, but core models, like shell model wit hmagic numbers or the liquid drop model are primarily handled in physical chemistry. \"I like to think about chemistry as the study of change\" “Ionic bonds. Chapter 6.” Rick Sanchez you’re goddamn right hmm.. no stoichometry? no moles? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstill great though This is about the concepts, not things like measuring for experiments Hmm...\\nComputer Science\\nBiology\\nAstronomy\\nGeology\\nEngineerimg And in the end, that and math all end up under the study of knowledge. Point is, they will always be a part of a great whole. Come to think of it if everything else in science can be theoretically figured out by physics and so everything else falls under physics or physical science. Rather, in something like this, we study something of a great whole, yes, but the overall specicialized depth is what is meant to be examined here, as in a broader map of x thing, get less specialized and specific and detailed into the field. Kyle Bell Chemistry and physics both fall under physical science. @Kyle Bennett \\nEh, feel it doesnt get enoigh love. Very unique suggestion! Map of cartography The Map of Biology next!!!!

Oh wait this channel is called the science domain Chemistry>Biology>Neurology >sociology>economics>politics>computer science> virtual reality>reality building. Physics -> Chemistry -> Biology!!!!! It must be coming up :) This should be mandatory at the beginning of each school year.. i loved the video but it seems like a dry overview for a starting point. topics like biochemistry and molecular biology are a lot more interesting if students get to play around with some experiments as a starting point. TimmacTR Although it is important to make the students realise how important a subject is, such a lengthy discourse might discourage them from studying about it. don\\'t get me wrong, I loved the video! you got the oxidizing and reducing agents backwards Missing: Synthetic chemistry. Reaction mechanisms. Inorganic chemistry and geology connection. In the video there’s only one sentence, that perfectly describes chemistry: “It’s so incredibly complicated.” 10:58 that minecraft grass block 😂😂😂 Maybe you should do a map of science in general. The Family Photo  what a hot mess science is @Algis But the basic skeleton of science is actually pretty straightforward. Social Sciences are just really complex biological phenomenon, Biology is just really complex Chemistry, Chemistry is just really complex Physics, and Physics is just really complex....we don\\'t know yet, but it probably has something to do with mathematics. This is the spine of the science from the human scale to the very small, But there\\'s a simultaneous one for science from the human scale to the very big. Geology is just really complex planetary Science, Planetary Science is just really complex Astronomy, and Astronomy is really just complicated Physics, like chemistry but for things on the really large scale. So in a way chemistry and astronomy are almost like the inverses/reciprocals of eachother, as they\\'re both immediately downstream of physics but but on completely opposite scales of magnification. You need to compile all the MAP OF VIDS to get your map... LOL!! A map of science.... That would be too long. To put it simply, a map of science in general would end up beyond any reasonable scope of a 12 minute lenght video, unless heavy generalization is involved. Plus add that people tend to have arguments what is and isn\\'t a science (as is currently the case with social sciences), so, yeah, it\\'d be impossible. It\\'s best to just look at it one-by-one. EVERYTHING CHEMISTRY WANT TO SAY : \"Exception\" [New Non-map video]\\nDomain of Science Guy: Hey I made this cool not map based video!~\\nEveryone\\'s response: Boo, do the map thing. Dude showed me my 2 years of high school under 12 minutes My science teacher recommended this video to my class, and I\\'m happy I actually chose to watch this. It gave me a bit of a bigger perspective! Fingers crossed that it goes well on the test too.. Loving the Breaking Bad inspired thumbnail! Respect the chemistry! \"Chlorine is the reducing agent and sodium is the oxidizing agent\" Oh yeah Organic chemistry does NOT look at the chemistry of living things. This idea is dead for at least a century now. “Chemistry is the study of matter, but I like to think of it as the study of change.” Physics is the study of matter. Chemistry is the study of electrons. Lol the part in the beginning about the formation of elements (\"Billions of years ago, super giant stars fused the hydrogen and helium into all the other elements\") reminds of the history of the entire world, I guess video (\"And some stars burn out and die with passion and make some new, way crazier shit\") I have learned a lot from Bill Wurtz. Reasons why i Love chemistry: All of that\\nReasons why i hate chemistry: Having to memorize all that and if you forget any detail u get your teacher saying \" You should know that\" as if thats they only thing going on in your head lol.\\nIm a chemistry major and even though its A LOT of work i really enjoy it. And after all you’re my Van Der waal who is the greatest chemist of all time?\\nsay his name 1:45\\n*Two years ago, and \\'\\'we\\'\\' already knew \\'\\'\\'Flevorium, Moscovium, Tennessine, and Oganesson??\\'*\\n\\n\\n\\nI STILL KNOW\\' EM AS _Ununtrium,_ _ununquadium, ununpetium,- _ununhexium, ununseptium and_ _ununoctium_ Great video but you got oxidising agent and reducing agent mixed up Domain of Science You’ve made a mistake that every single student/HUMAN, has made. \\n\\nIn chemistry everything possible is upside down. For example pH. The lower, the more acidic (sorry for not proper English). But how? pH is defined as the concentration of H+, so the lower, the more basic is it! Well  pH is positive log of 10^-n, therefore lower pH means the concentration is 10^-3, (which is greater than 10^-7), therefore pH3 is more acidic that pH7.\\n\\nThis blows mind and thus is so difficult for young students to comprehend, because they have to fight with these stuff :D An easy way to remember the correct terms is OILRIG:\\r\\n\\r\\nOxidation\\r\\nIs\\r\\nLoss\\r\\n\\r\\nReduction\\nIs\\nGain\\n\\n\\nAlso, the names do actually make sense if you take more than 5 minutes to look it up. @the guy saying it\\'s just dumb terminology\\n\\n\\nElectrons are negatively charged. So when an electron is gained, the atom becomes more negative. Charge lowered = reduction. Wait! No he didn\\'t. Look it up. Chemists let\\'s just say suck at naming things. So they called gain of electrons reduction and loss oxidation. @I Echion Here\\'s a simple explanation: So electrons are negatively charged. Protons are positively charged. When you take away an electron, then that means there are more protons, which means more positive charges than negative, which means it is now positive, and vice versa. Hey! Great video, very well illustrated and organized. About the drawings in the video, how did you make them? Would love to check that out. Very nice work! \" We\\'re all made of star stuff\" -Carl Sagan Map of biology? Maybe? Is that possible? B R A S I L 2019 tmj!!! who wants such video on engineering??

Could you make a video about domains of Biology? It would be really cool to use in the classroom. :) excellent vid, as a chemical engineering student this was nostalgic to watch...really good work. I love learning about science the language of the universe What about nuclear chemistry ?\\n\\nThat\\'s the real fun stuff almost 3 years of school in 12 minutes thx Map of engineering pls!!! When you talked about REDOX Reaction at 4:50 minutes. Shouldn\\'t sodium be a reducing agent and chlorine be an oxidizing agent? You just make me love science more than the entire school , i just feel like i\\'ve got to learn them all I\\'m now officially a chemist. Redox reaction... not heard that term in a long time, and Im happy about that. People need to calm down on the criticism. He\\'s not a chemist so obviously he\\'s gonna get some stuff wrong. @Giant Runt :) I agree with all three of these guys here I agree with both of you guys Doesn\\'t mean it shouldn\\'t be pointed out Map of how to get a date. uh please help Do economics map  or map of different political systems. No one noticed the confusing way he demonstrated Double Replacement reaction all hail chemistry  , may the knowledge of the nucleique acide be with you Awesome. Extremely helpful for people like me who need a general overall idea before dealing with specifics. Excellent. Thank you. I wish I had seen this in first-year chemistry! Although...I\\'m not sure consciousness is a function of physics, chemistry and biology. It might be the other way around. But that\\'s philosophy for you. i know what _i\\'m_ going to major in!\\n(technically i\\'ve known, but i just wanted to express my burning passion for chemistry.) These are absolutely great videos!  I imagine these maps being made into a swf/flash file so you can explore the maps like the Scale of the Universe flash file!!! I place in the map is due for industrial chemistry: design and operation of chemcal plants and industrial chemical processes. It is a field in between chemistry and engineering. May I have a map of modern investment instruments, please. 4:06 Not to not pick (The is wonderful!) But shoudn’t the double siplacment reaction have switched the b and d (the negative ions) not a negative and a positive? How does the redox work? The only way would be to loose and gain electons from what I understand? If our school and college teachers also explain like this it will be great, yours a very great explanation sir. thanks for u r service. I was baby when people started trying to teach me such things At 04:50, in the case of NaCl, if we\\'re speaking redox language, Na should be the reducing agent and Cl should be the oxidizing agent.

Just a little note: doesn\\'t hydrogen bond with a single bond? In the video you show a double. Yes you are right! Darn it. I don\\'t know why I drew a double bond. Thanks! This is incredible. Finally know the categories of study that I favor. Thank you. this is amazing!! omc thank you, is so didactic!!  Map of biology please!! :DD I wish I could have known this video earlier.... \\n\\nthx for making this awesome video Nice, now I\\'m ready for my college chem final E-X-C-E-L-E-N-T.  Thanks for a great video. Hi DOS, great video, I liked it very much. I study chemistry myself so more stuff about chemistry please.\\n\\nPS\\nI had a Quantum chemistry exam last week and dont tell me that you can not simulate a multiple body problem. I had to do it with a pen and paper for H2, H2+, O2, B2 and prove that He2 can not exist. Yaaaas. I love this series 😍♥️ great content 👍🏻 can\\'t wait to see more of these 1. Map of Biology\\n2.

       " 'The public school system sucks. I get all of my education on YouTube. Oh, man. Where was you are at school time, at buffet? very true Same here After 5 years of business school, I completely agree 😂 @tropickman Yes, the issuance of money (primary-->Central Bank; secondary-->FRBS Fractional Reserve Banking System) is the key of the bubbles.  If the FRBS is forbidden and we set an issuance money cap to the Central Bank, throughout the Progressive Growth of the Money Supply ---> all the big bubbles out! The bubbles-pockets are natural phenomena in free markets. This taught me more about economics in 30 minutes than all my years at school. This is simply the best explanation on economics by Ray Dalio.....No video matches this...\\nRay Dalio on Navigating Big Debt Crises:\\nhttps://youtu.be/0-obY4ZtLxE This is simply the best explanation on economics by Ray Dalio.....No video matches this...\\nRay Dalio on Navigating Big Debt Crises:\\nhttps://youtu.be/0-obY4ZtLxE I’m not trying to be mean or anything... or maybe i am... That’s because you try teaching complex stuff to children, and they don’t read it. They don’t do the homework. They scream out, “I fucking hate school”. Then, when they don’t even know how to do math, they try to point back and say the school system is broken!?! Like they owe all this stuff to them, FOR FREEE?!?! That’s too freaking much self entitlement for me to even hear. I taught myself about simple fucking economics while I was just taking shits in the toilet. Out of responsibility. I didn’t ask anybody to teach me it, nor did I point fingers at anybody for not just giving it to me because they owe me it. Y’all just a bunch of bitches in my personal opinion. Ade Naas thats cause you’re sheep. That system created the best economy in the world. Then you never went to college 😂😂😂 try teaching an immature 17 year old this shit bud Less than 5 minues into this and I already feel so much more educated and I have finished a whole page of notes. Oddly enough this is actually fun. Why isn\\'t school like this?? School is a factory where they pay sometimes even unqualified \\'teachers\\'. To teach students who they rob and charge ridiculous amounts for garbage books. For a job that will want experience or be over satured anyway. They dont give a shit theyre 100% just looking for your debt. Because teachers aren’t Ray Dalio. You guys realize the impact this man has had in the world economy? Because its straight to the point im doing this and taking notes for university Case or example\\n\\n\\nState R prints money in the name of mabo ... and mabo transactions are used all over the world and the R state is very difficult for debt and inflation because more countries need money for transactions such as world oil or the like ... and countries A, B, C and\\xa0 T converts money or buys Mabo money into country R for transactions ... and country R can burn state A and T money ... and countries A and T print more money for transactions within their country ... and countries A and T cost 2x\\xa0 print money .. can the country R be transparent to other countries\\' currencies that have been in exchange rates or change to mabo currencies .. how many countries have changed these currencies .. the money is made transactions in to that country .. if not transactions to that country\\xa0 is there still money from their country\\'s money? YouTube is the world\\'s Biggest University. Agreed, but while this video gave some valuable insights, it\\'s wrong to imply that there is such a thing as a beautiful deleveraging. Millions of people suffer when they take on debt. I\\'ve had a habit of only spending half of what I make, and investing the rest. I\\'m getting through this financial crisis just fine as a result. Other people aren\\'t. Central banks exploit the weakness of undisciplined people. Their desire for immediate gratification. Everything you buy with borrowed money costs more because of the interest payments, so your hard work ends up buying less over the long run as a result. A lot of your hard work ends up benefiting the lenders, not you. Taxes would be far less if governments operated the same way I do, only spending half of what they make until there is enough saved to easily get through the times like this. Lower taxes would result in everyone having more money to spend. The only time money should be borrowed is when someone has a sure-fire business plan. An idea for an enterprise that is sure to make a sustainable profit. Consumers should NEVER borrow. People should just live with their parents until they save up enough to buy a car, and then a home with cash. If you live a life of austerity early in life, you end up FAR WEALTHIER in life. That\\'s true for individuals AND governments. The central banks are siphoning wealth from people on a MASSIVE scale. Dalio should be telling people to DETHRONE this system, but he won\\'t because he profits from it. Watch this video for better insight. >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0&feature=emb_title When your parents are foreign or uneducated and school doesn’t educate you, youtube is always the #1 source. we are late but better late than ever 20 years ago, when ordinary TV was still a thing, a teacher told us in class: \"TV makes smart people smarter and dumb people dumber\". Nowadays this applies to Youtube. Agreed Can we all take a moment to appreciate the quality of the animation here!!

The global pandemic has smashed the global productivity line... They are trying to print huge amounts to make up for it, but eventually the economy will find its natural equilibrium that is in line with global productivity. I watch this video every 6 months or so.. it makes sense every single time. like he said, those are basic principles that don\\'t change. there\\'s your proof for that ;) \"Most of what people thought was money, was actually credit\"... This applies to much more than just the economy. That\\'s our society in a nutshell right there Imagine you just finished university studying economics. You just spend 2-3 years studying and collect about 50k debt, and now you come across this video 😂 And realised most of what they taught you was bullshit Marcus Taylor I mean, you’ve just described a form of barter, or a credit-free form of exchange of services. You sound like you’re living closer to a subsistence lifestyle, rather than a growth lifestyle. Certainly much more sustainable, and probably what humanity might need to tend towards for the longer term stability of the planet Case or example\\n\\n\\nState R prints money in the name of mabo ... and mabo transactions are used all over the world and the R state is very difficult for debt and inflation because more countries need money for transactions such as world oil or the like ... and countries A, B, C and\\xa0 T converts money or buys Mabo money into country R for transactions ... and country R can burn state A and T money ... and countries A and T print more money for transactions within their country ... and countries A and T cost 2x\\xa0 print money .. can the country R be transparent to other countries\\' currencies that have been in exchange rates or change to mabo currencies .. how many countries have changed these currencies .. the money is made transactions in to that country .. if not transactions to that country\\xa0 is there still money from their country\\'s money?

Well said. I think this pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn\\'t mean security. So I really appreciate your transparency and giving people a fighting chance during these troubling times I invested in QR6,000 and got an ROI of QR18,000. I was really happy and impressed that his services added to my wealth I\\'m not much of a fan of Forex, but after a colleague at work showed me his profit after working with Mr Anderson, I was forced to try it out Greetings from Qatar Those scammers they promise to make up to $50,000 profit within the space of 7 days with just $500 to invest and end up not even refunding your capital but he\\'s a man of integrity, with $500 he will tell you he can only make profit within the range of $4000 to $8,900 and he actually delivers ....he\\'s great @yang sophia OMG!!!... he really offered you a great help indeed, that\\'s cool of him I do love 💞 that. This is 30 minutes of my time well spent Took me a little over an hour to get through the 30 mins because I was pausing to reflect on what was said. Ray Dalio explains it all!\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaPrKFt-w5UYVwsnIZ162pLcbIwKZxgbo @snide 2 I would love to disagree with you lol. Peace from New Zealand. @jdfarr45 For starters, Ray Dalio isn\\'t a Jew.  You\\'re nuts if you think that \"Jews\" have some conspiracy. Im Jewish. I work my a** off and I\\'m in debt because of dumb choices I made. Majority of my people people work hard. Some make it economically, some don\\'t. Many have financial literacy which helps economically. Many are overachievers. In my community there\\'s generally a culture of personal and communal responsibility and commitment to family.\\nWithout getting granular, many Jews probably champion the exact economic theories that you\\'re convinced of. Don\\'t jump to call millions of anyone \"evil\" etc. Peace unto you. Владислав Пилипенко yea it is weird I’m not believing him. It’s just racist bullshit. I think one needs to be a genius in order to be able to explain such an incredibly complex thing in such a beautifully simple way. Ray Dalio is a genius Yeah, generally it\\'s a good measure of someones grasp of an idea. For most people if they can explain something quite well, in a manner most people will easily understand, then they probably have an excellent grasp of said thing (or are very good story tellers). If someone can\\'t explain something to you very well (unless it\\'s say, quantum physics level abstract) then they either don\\'t really know what they are talking about or have a communication issue.\\n   Concerning this video, at first I thought: \\'Oh no... he\\'s going to grossly oversimplify and miss stuff\\'. By the end of it I was thinking: \"I hope I can explain economic ideas half this well one day...\". Who\\'s here because you want to learn essential lessons that aren\\'t taught in school? If you really care about  essential lessons then you need to watch The Choice Is Ours instead. This one does not portray the true picture on what really goes on under the hood. @Supernatural Forces Your argument seems to assume a stagnant, no-growth economy. \\n\\nPrice inflation happens when money is printed in excess of actual growth.  If an economy grows, and most do, then more money is needed to represent the value in it.  Money printing alone doesn\\'t cause inflation.  Money printing in excess of actual growth does. I can\\'t think of many essentials that schools teach kids @Josip Dasovic Also this pertains only to the US, if I\\'m not mistaken. @Matt Athauda ↑ See? :D love this class. I will make everyone in my family see this including my dog. I like ur sense of humor. Now he (my dog) has a different walk, more confidence. Your comment made me burst into laughter lol hahaha This video should be shown in schools before they start to teach the textbook economics !!\\nMost people don\\'t know how the economy actually works, I was one of them before watching this video,but slowly my understanding of economics is increasing !!!\\nThanks RAY DALIO !!! 💐💐💐👍👍👌👌 Learned more in 30min video than in 3 years economy class Elena, where do you study? Seriously. Really; what exactly did you learn? Hi Elena...... me too @Nicholas Brown you watch Fox News? blahahahahahahaaha! then you slept thru 3 years of economics. watched 7 years later, and most of the problems have appeared today: 0 interest rate, more printing, revolution, next will be war? Wish a beautiful deleveraging Moral of the story: Seriously, stop taking out loans to buy a TV or something you don\\'t absolutely need like a house. Debt is useful but it\\'s dangerous. Ummm..... that\\'s not the moral of the story at all.... @Jake Kline\\'s Fancy Noises There are many reasons a home may be costly.  Perhaps the most common one is that in places where people want to live, for example due to good jobs, good weather, good schools, etc., demand exceeds supply.  \\n\\nI never argued for mcmansions.  I was trying to explain that most ordinary working people need a loan to buy a house.  Nothing more.\\n\\nUsury has specific legal meaning, though the biblical meaning may be different.  Legally, home loans at 3% interest are not usury.\\n\\nP.S. \"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\" @Loanword Eggcorn the only reason it\\'s exceedingly hard for a home buyer to acquire a property is because people have taken that ticket millions of times in the U.S.  Did you know studies show that, once a very minimal square footage per person is reached, excess space in a home actually begins to contribute negatively to happiness, rather than positively?  And the required square footage is shockingly small, contrasted with modern American expectations.  The optimal number was something like 750 sqft to start, plus either 50 or a 150 square foot per person.  But this is where consumeristic materialism and usery get a people.\\n\\nWe never needed mcMansions to be happy, and we never needed usery for anything, let alone healthy and sustainable growth, which is impossible when we have to feed the beast.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the everything bubble may very well be about to burst as we speak. @Jake Kline\\'s Fancy Noises Agree with everything you wrote, to some extent.  \\n\\nYet, over the long term, real estate and other real assets are a great investment, especially due to inflation.  Real assets hold value and/or appreciate over the long term.\\n\\nReal estate organically goes up in value where there is demand, since its supply is limited.\\n\\nBanks do not own properties that are fully paid for.  \\n\\nBanks facilitate growth.  Without a lender, its exceedingly hard for a home buyer to acquire a property.  It\\'s also hard for someone to build a new home to create new supply without a lender.  Not impossible, but very hard.\\n\\nIt\\'s really easy to paint banks as the bad guy, but it\\'s also not completely fair if one considers their actual role and function.\\n\\nDon\\'t take the easy way out.  Think.\\n\\nAnd yes, I\\'m aware of banks buying government bonds with Fed credit.  It\\'s how both are capitalized.  Credit needs to come from somewhere.   Chicken and egg. @Loanword Eggcorn it\\'s the timing, that undoes those who take your advice.  The boom-bust cycle is a natural result of a system that issues money at interest, with no interest-free money to pay back the exponentially growing debt.  The practical end of the stick is that there are always, always losers, and the banks always, always get the real assets out of them, in exchange for owning and operating the funny-money system. Step 1: Create Asset Bubble by increasing Money Supply\\nStep 2: Burst Asset Bubble\\nStep 3: Offer help by printing more money and demand structural and political reforms to increase your power\\nStep 4: Buy assets at low prices, force conditions on parties which face problems\\nStep 5: Repeat.\\n\\nFor detailed instructions see:\\nDocumentary on: Princes of the Yen (on Youtube) @Xez1919 righteous, thank you!  :) Wat? SERUM (SRM) IS THE INVESTMENT OF 2020 @Jake Kline\\'s Fancy Noises no problem, I am against the monopolization of intellectual property, so go ahead ;-) Do you care if I try to write this into a song?\\nNo promises on results, just seeking permission first Who\\'s here in June - 2020.. we are 23:43 Social Unrest... ooh I wonder what happens next? @CHECK CHECK it\\'s because republicans aren\\'t socialists @caleb Tse Shut up, I know more economics than anybody.

He quickly approved stimulus money and he is creating new jobs. @caleb Tse trump has been a businessman mogul his entire life, what the fuck are you saying,lmao? @caleb Tse Trump has been a businessman since the 70s im pretty sure he understands all this, the problem is that he either cant or wont do something to fix it considering how little politicians care about the common citizen Who\\'s watching amidst the corona crashes of 2020? @Youssef Dirani Nah wtf...really? I\\'m shocked! I was thinking more of the Amish, you know... @SquareRootOf2 the jews @Ava _08 same Me! Nicholas Brown trump is causing bigger debt than previous presidents. There’s even statistics showing that Holy crap this is from 2013, even the protests right now check out.

PLOT 20 day ema + 50 day ema and see carefully :D @Permadoc it never is @Ana Bonet I feel that the state can print more money and less debt .. Army buildings or spy buildings but it prints money inside .. the money can be used to buy weapons, conduct research, prevent country debt, invest in other countries, make loans to the country other .. because the military building is a secret which should not be known by others ... can you investigate for that .. @Salim  I think is a need to forbid the Fractional Reserve Banking System (FRB), i.e., I agree with Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, Huerta de Soto, etc. But once forbidden the secondary monetary expansion (FRB), how do to coordinate the industrial monetary needs?  Well, they are several options, like the Chicago Plan Revised, but after reading Pedro Gomez\\'s book, the best solution is the monetary expansion through-out the Progressive Growth of the Money Supply Principle. This system sets a cap in order for Central Banks and politicians can\\'t issuance money over the quantity indicated by the own market. I suggest reading The Wealth of Nations in the 21st Century, by Pedro Gomez, which analyze all the options to issuance money, their strengths and weaknesses. A very interesting historical review and, furthermore a new and realistic proposal to issue money, that allows controlling the man in charge of the printer machine. www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiKr-i022mY Case or example\\n\\n\\nState R prints money in the name of mabo ... and mabo transactions are used all over the world and the R state is very difficult for debt and inflation because more countries need money for transactions such as world oil or the like ... and countries A, B, C and\\xa0 T converts money or buys Mabo money into country R for transactions ... and country R can burn state A and T money ... and countries A and T print more money for transactions within their country ... and countries A and T cost 2x\\xa0 print money .. can the country R be transparent to other countries\\' currencies that have been in exchange rates or change to mabo currencies .. how many countries have changed these currencies .. the money is made transactions in to that country .. if not transactions to that country\\xa0 is there still money from their country\\'s money? this information is too much to handle for the average American Lets take a moment to appreciate the amazing animation in this video 19:30 “wealth is redistributed from the have’s to the have not”. Total and utter rubbish the ruling class never do that! It’s true you just have to know how to capitalize off a crisis. I never understood economics until now. What a perfect explanation! Big fan! Who\\'s watching in 2020? This is the best economics lesson I\\'ve ever gotten. for real man, 100% agree @fynes leigh Your worship of universities is concerning to me. \\n\\nResearch the currency debasement of Ancient Greece; they didn\\'t need to know about Keynes to use Keynesian economics.\\n\\nBut hey, maybe I\\'m just a retard and the economy will do just fine! Trust the bankers and stay invested in stocks and fiat lol. The world is about to learn a hard lesson it\\'s learned many times before, and I\\'ve no sympathy for those that defend this foolishness. @AndrewJackson If you please; at which University studying what did you encounter all these Keynesians and how many precisely did you canvas for their views?\\r\\n\\r\\nT-h-o-u-s-a-n-d-s of years you say; how many thousands of years would you say that Keynesians have been around? I wonder if you know when Maynard Keynes was born and when he died and that the chances that his ideas have been put into practice for   thousand years is stretching the imagination to put it well beyond snapping point, but apparently that hasn\\'t occurred to you, or perhaps it has; you tell me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m bound to say that I have discovered no particular merit in the ideas of Maynard Keynes  who was undoubtedly a learned  man of sorts, but the idea that his ideas have influenced people for thousands of years is just the tiniest bit dubious would you not say?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever subject you studied the University plainly did not call for any intellectual rigour whatsoever, but I think we both know that you have never been anywhere near a university in your life to we not? Certainly not a university that would tolerate sloppy language and sloppy thinking like that. @fynes leigh The people that study economics at universities are keynesians that have inflated fiat currencies to collapse for thousands of years. How do you know? When did you last study economics at University, or  at  any level?\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone knows to cure a kicking horse but him that has   him, and everyone supposes that he is an expert on economics, which in reality is a species of politics and or   religion.The first thing that you learn when you study economic is what money is, and since very few people understand economics everyone is an expert on it and nobody actually knows anything about it or understands that it is merely a species of politics or religion and that there is no such thing as the science of economics because economics is not a science, For the simple reason that it is impossible to directly immediately personally apprehend(as directly  and immediately  as  pain) such a complicated and vast thing as all the transactions that go on in various markets, So effectively the only method is to guess or estimate. Of course you ask other people but they generally lie or a mistaken,  that being the nature of men (human beings). This video just proves what king Solomon said:\\n\\n*The servant is borrower to the lender.*\\n\\nAs smooth talking as Ray sounds he is indirectly admitting that the Central Banks control the short and long term debt cycles. While we are meant to see it as a result of \"human nature\" this is in fact a problem which has been artificially created.\\n\\nSadly we have another classical case of the _Wizard of Oz_ occurring with the man behind the curtain. The man behind the curtain being the central government and the central banks operating the levers of this \"Economic Machine\". Yet how do people fall for this facade? *When the people lose their brains* (Scarecrow = No Education), *lose their hearts* (Tinman = Unfeeling Machine), and *become cowardly* (Lion = Loss of bravery): then the people are easily terrorized by the ravenous flying monkeys and duped by the spells of the wicked witch. @Michael_S_K piercing explanation.  I thought I was going to have to explain the social engineering but you put it in terms that renew my understanding of the importance. I would have to answer this with a resounding *no.* To say that the central banks \"control\" the debt cycles is not correct. By cutting or raising interest rates, they merely incentivize certain modes of behavior, i.e. lending and spending, or saving and hoarding. The fact that they can *influence* the debt cycle through this is because of human nature. If you are offered a credit with little interest, you are more likely to take it. However, the central banks cannot control what you *do* with that money. If you use it to create a business that creates value for society, there is a benefit for everyone and you can of course pay back the money. If you use it to buy a TV that results in you spending your evenings with sitting around and watching stuff, instead of doing productive/creative work, then that is *your* responsibility.\\n\\nAs such, it is in human nature to take \"that which comes easy\", then quickly get used to it, take it for granted and basically waste it. It is in fact the *advertising business* that helps bring forth the worst in human nature: by telling us that we are entitled to the most modern devices, and the newest and most expensive items, they create a dissonance in us. So we are supposed to have earned all these things just by being born, but we don\\'t have the money for it? The solution is easy: lend and consume. The long-term outcome: an economic bubble and hard times.\\n\\nThe business of advertising is the true culprit: from attacking our physical health (downplaying the dangers of fast food, sweets & cigarettes) to our financial health (buying things we don\\'t really need or actually want) to our social health (creating ever more addictive social media software), they have not spared any aspect of our lives. There are only two ways to solve this: regulate the ad business, or strengthen our wills and values. what a great comment, thanks for sharing. @Lonnie T human nature is merely what is taken advantage of by what I described one comment above this one. @Infinite Rings  The boom-bust cycle is a natural result of a system that issues money at interest, with no interest-free money to pay back the exponentially growing debt. The practical end of the stick is that there are always, always losers-- it\\'s mere timing, which undoes some of those who borrow-- and the central banks always, always get the real assets out of them, in exchange for owning and operating a funny-money system. Universities are now wells of poison, due to hegemony of \\'grievance studies\\' don\\'t send your kids there., learn online. 11:10 If everyone is borrowing some amount of money, why isn\\'t it the case that the lending pool eventually dries up and it self corrects the cycle without going into deflation, deleverage, or depression?\\n\\nAnd one thing almost no one talks about, when you have extra spending power, you also give birth to \\'extra\\' children. As an extreme example, when poverty strikes, you sell even sometimes kill your horse. But this doesn\\'t apply to your children generally. Those children have much more longevity than a horse. So a prolonged expense problem in the society gets created. You can cut down your snacks expense, but you can reduce the food expense of your children only so much. I think what else I want to say is self explanatory. \\n\\nSo policy makers should focus more on population control, it solves a huge number of problems simultaneously. When population is under control, if the society is not fundamentally corrupt, wealth is distributed somewhat equally, everyone is happy, no need to borrowing.\\n\\nAlso notice in the long run, the GDP or growth reaches the same point by either way - increasing productivity, or creating credits. In addition to what he said at the end about not having more income than your productivity, it can be reminded with the help of a saying - \\'What you haven\\'t achieved, was only given to you, will eventually also be taken away.\\' im more confused than ever... well atleast i tried @DJ Poopy Pants I am with you 100% friend./ Less greed, l;less need for material stuff while STILL realizing that I do need certain material items to get by. a decent floor of material items, shelter, food, and hobbies, and I am all set. NO children. \\n\\nI agree that I don\\'t want too much bogging me down. And at 39 I am not a desperate for female attention As I was in my youth. I am also disabled now, so that takes priority. My last job fuccked my body up, so I am trying to get on disability for years. Now I have a public defender. Anyways, I am able to get by with the help of 2 or 3 family members and things are ok under the circumstances. @Dennzer1 Interesting. You can\\'t really trust anyone these days. That\\'s also human nature. For me a way out of this madness is to want less and be content with less. Less greed and less desires. No 9 to 5 or crazy productivity in order to keep up with the rat race or dog-eat-dog world just to fund objects of desire. No children for me either. It\\'s not easy since you are already born with desires, but on top of that the world teaches you as a child to desire things. It seems the more you have, the more you are owned. Regardless if its objects or ideas and goals. They all own you. This guy is the ceo of the largest hedge fund in the world. Be highly suspect of everything he says, especially the part about the cycles. total horseshitr. The boom bust cycles are created by wall street crime. The S.E.C. doesn\\'t even investigate wall street crime any longer. \\n\\nThis Ray Dalio ass wipe WANTS you to think that the cause of cycles is the fact that we borrow? Or some such BS. \\n\\nThe stock market is fully socialized from printed money from the fed to the tune of trillions. The coming crash will make the great depression look like happy times. watch it again or ask other people questions about the things you learned dont give up This is one of my all time favorite videos.

This video sums up what took me about 4 years of gradual self learning to know in only 30 minutes! @Hawkins I already did all research that you didn\\'t do. And I can confirm that nobody is printing dollars out of nothing. Go research yourself. @Absolute Zerooh your ego is triggered now I see. Do yourself a favor, go do some research on what required reserve ratio is and on money creation. There is no point talking to you since you have no clues what you are talking about. Gross. @Hawkins Fiscal policy has nothing to do with credit, you are just speaking nonsense. @Hawkins the 20% is not the capital, it is the minimum deposit in cash the Bank has to have in order to be able to provide withdrawals in cash. If you are using credit card, this 20% deposit stays the same.\\nInterest on debt is not free money, it is earnings! I get the logic, it is you who is not getting it. @Absolute Zero also, you are referring to Fiscal policy. The Fed is responsible for Monetary policy. This has educated me on such a level incomparable to the public school system This is indeed the best education in economics I have ever come across.

Hmm! Implying that if someone is considered being the greatest mind alive, you should not disagree with him. There goes science down the drain. @Paragon of Growth Very well; it would appear that we are more or less on the same page, but the problem is that when you use the word people you beg the question: \"which people\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m afraid I am unable to apprehend anything as vague and imprecise as what you call \"people\" at large. I\\'m going to brainwash myself, my wife, and my kids of this video 😂 Something tells me the interest rate on the bonds the central government buys from the central bank, are different than the ones available to taxpayers/general public. aren\\'t int rates zero during deleverage? 21:12 Yes, let\\'s do that. We’re entering our lost decade? One of most important point we must focus on is how beautiful the economy without debt would have been , A linear ever increasing regression ....Debt makes our next generation to pay for what their fathers used to spend as their extra expenditure @Chris debt with interest is always bad and in long run it is designed to enslaves the humanity as whole I think it is also important to understand that there is both good debt and bad debt.

I understand this from the video.\\n\\nAt the phase when the long term debt cycle is at its peak, you need to sell your assets to generate cash and you need to buy assets when the long term debt cycle is at the lowest.\\n\\nThis way you can earn more by selling assets at a high value and buying assets at a low value. Thus, the economic machine and long term debt cycle won\\'t have a big of an impact on you!\\n\\nEdit: Please comment if got any better idea than me or if mine is not accurate. Buy low, sell high. I like it. Only problem is that you don’t know when it’s at the very top or when it’s at the very bottom...

They\\'re cheating the system and everyone who doesn\\'t have a friend on the inside, hell they got Martha Stewart on that. what happens when there are no interest rates, just the debt?

And through the ability to create money from thin air, they can buy the favors of politicians, lawmakers etc.. Robert Couch Walking behind a Reel Mower is much, much healthier than walking behind a Gas mower. It’ll cut the grass cleaner and cheaper and take up less room in the garage. \\n\\nPeople want to “ save time “ and use gas self propelled or riding mowers, only to spend even more time and money at a Gym or walking around the neighborhood for exercise.   \\n\\nThis is just the tip of the the Iceberg of 1,000’s of things that don’t make sense and/or efficient. \\nAstonishing for being in the 21st Century. One would think by now with all the combined time, experience, education and resources from a growing population we would do things better, smarter and more efficient. \\n\\nIt’s not that we aren’t smart enough, it’s that society puts profit first and putting energy into Looks & Design rather than Quality, Efficiency, Reliability and Durability.  \\n\\nSmart for Business and Profit, bad for Customers and Customers finances. Corporate America will sell you bull if you’re willing to buy bull. Ultimately it’s customers fault. No business can survive without customers. Smart marketing is not a reoccurring/ongoing cost, unlike a higher quality of material for a product. @YouTubesShitSorter I agree with your analogy with the lawn mower I\\'m sure of it that man\\'s downfall will be due to his efficiency so I went out to try to buy a new lawn mower one of those Scott push mowers are talking about it was a piece of s*** what gave me the idea to buy one was that I was at a antique store pushing one in the front of the store it cut the grass unbelievably easily quiet low cost no oil no gas and you can hang it up in the garage I agree with you man\\'s efficiency will be his downfall that lawn mower example I tried buying one of those Scott push mowers it was a piece of s*** although I I tried one at an antique store could not believe how the old ones cut the grass so easy and held up to everything that you said I\\'d say watch The Choice Is Ours for a potential way our of this mess we put ourselves into The United States population in- itself will grow regardless of the economy status and unemployment rates. The solution doesn\\'t get easier as time goes on and the problem only gets bigger, as the population of people \\'wanting to work\\' will increase with no jobs available. The oilfield and oilfield sustained companies can only support a certain size population here in the states regardless of how great and big it is.  As a massive backbone money generator to the economy it brings in money and keeps money exchanging hands, \\'physical cash \\' as it is passed from banks to restaurants, food, housing and activities and so on. \\n\\nWe are all at the mercy of the \\'population growth itself \\' some think we\\'re at the mercy of the mega rich, as it would seem they have all the money that would fix everything. But given Bill Gates billions, evenly distributed across America alone ( 300+ million people ) wouldn\\'t change anything. \\n\\nAny president can tax the rich but, it does \\'nothing\\' as a money generator to \\'grow\\' our economy. It’ll just sustain it with Food Stamps, Housing, and Medical Care until the rich are no longer rich, and the middle-class becomes closer to being poor because of taxation, which in turn will add more people to being on gov\\'t benefits, increasing taxes once again for the rich. \\n\\nThe problem this country is facing is bigger than a superhero president can fix, after all if it doesn\\'t get pass congress it doesn\\'t happen... India has more citizens with IQ\\'s over 120 than the \\'total\\' population of the United States, 300+ million, enough to replace the whole United States with what modern society considers \\'geniuses\\' but, yet those 300 million geniuses combined cannot fix their own economy with a massive 890 million people in poverty making less than $2 a day. \\n\\nAmericans hope, wish and pray some president and local politicians are going to fix it all, but when you logically look at all the facts, economy and the majority of people and their situation surrounding us all, I realistically don\\'t see how. \\n\\nThe growing Population, Poverty Rate, Unemployment Rate, Crime, Real Estate prices, Taxes and prices of everything (Healthcare & Groceries ) Post Office prices, Automobile Prices are steadily increasing... \\n\\nADD all this up along with advancements in Technology, self driving cars, faster, more efficient & reliable machines that need less human interaction. At the same time it increases productivity, which brings down demand, which in turn brings down the price of the product. \\n\\nSo for example what you end up with is a bunch of farmers, and new farmers with modern, faster, expensive equipment. Equipment that they’re all trying to pay for and make a living, while essentially working against each other and themselves by racing to produce the most product, the fastest possible while the market is in demand. \\n\\nSeveral civilizations were wiped out by their own doing, meaning they harvested animals & resources smarter, faster and more efficiently, than the resources themselves could replenish. It was arguably the first sustainability crisis. The modern resource today being money. \\n\\nThe more work, a farmer,  for instance does, the more work he creates, the more equipment he needs and the more frequent repairs become. Often times fulfilling false demand. Planting more to fulfill last years shortage but, it’s too much for this years demand. Meaning it, the product went to waste or sold for pennies on the dollar of what it cost to harvest. Or just to break even, not counting time, let alone a profit. Time that could have been doing something profitable. \\n\\nAs a country we went from Manual Push Reel mowers that were quiet, didn\\'t pollute the air, didn\\'t require gas & oil, you could mow grass at anytime of the day or night without disturbing your neighbor, to \\' More \\' Expensive, Loud, Non-Catalytic converter polluting mowers that rips the grass rather than actually ‘ cutting the grass ‘. My point is don\\'t assume as a society we\\'re making better decisions elsewhere. This is from years ago and it looks like the explanation of a depression is happening right now. Delevaraging is happening because of the pandemic.\\nIn the cycle he animated its like removing a cogwheel and no longer works.\\nInflation and interest couldnt be pulled down causing economic collapse\\nI learned a lot today\\nThanks I love the fact that this YouTube video doesn\\'t have ads... no distraction, full consistent focus, maximum understanding.

And a beautiful woman! 🌹 G☺️😔😔 Even me lol *One thing to remember: inflation benefits borrowers and deflation benefits lenders.* To echo what a lot of users have already stated. This really should be taught in schools. Money runs the world, whether you like it or not, and the fact that we\\'re not taught about how taxes, inflation, credit, interest rates etc. really tells you a lot. now I can predict economy crash with this education.\\nKnowing your history you know the future.\\nbut prediction is almost always wrong. So I just stick to analytics. I Like the straight line more, this is just aksing for choas into something would could be order 10:22 don´t mind me, just marking the only thing i understand. That’s was an amazing production. I learned and laughed at the same time.👍 14:16 that \"why\"... This great video sheds light on how sensitive our economy is...But today, \"close\" the economy for a Pandemic month what does this event do to our future long term cycle?  No historic event like this to chart? Going into an election year we need to  pay close attention to who has the most \"beautiful\" balanced deleveraging plan! \"Do everything we can to increase productivity power since that\\'s the only thing that matters in the long run\" \\nSo true... Therefore investing in science and research is paramount, as those are the main things today that have a transformative effect on our ability to do things, at a fundamental level. It\\'s the biggest thing that separates our current state of civilisation from the Dark Ages. its all make sense now this is how our economics works @AKM Bhuiyan good healthcare, housing and education are a science - knowing how to correctly run society is a science. \\nThey\\'re the direct consequences of an improving civilisation. \\n\\nI\\'m sure healthcare would\\'ve been just faaantastic during the medieval times, when people didn\\'t know germ theory, were using leeches to drain blood, cutting people open. \\n\\nI\\'m sure housing would have been fantastic during feudalism, when peasants lived in houses constructed out of mud covered straws and rocks.\\n\\nI\\'m sure education would have been awesome during the Roman inquisition, when free thinking is suppressed, and you get burned alive for postulating the universe is infinite in size. \\n\\nThe point is to fundamentally transform society, ever improving, so that future generations live in a world with ever greater chance of having good healthcare, housing education...everything. How about healthcare how about housing how about education Probably the best video on economics I\\'ve seen in my life! One of the best teachings I\\'ve ever seen. Beautiful! My dad didn\\'t believe me one bit when I mentioned that printing money is one of the options or the only viable option in a deep depression scenario. Hope this video enlightens him. I feel like I should pay some money to this guy after watching this video. I have my grandchildren watching! I CANT EXPLAIN BETTER MYSELF! @Oli Hasan can you tell me where to find this cash? @Kabir Kanha nice to know there are caring people still out there! Good...keep the economy rolling. Lol Ray Dalio is doing his part here to pay back to society what he\\'s received. I\\'m very appreciative of his efforts. This guy forgot to factor in tax.  All spending cut in half with TAX! good luck! its covered under the deflationary measures aka redistribution of wealth Excellent vid!! Concisely and simply explaining how the economy works! The graphics helped out a lot! Moral of the story is to spend when others are saving and save when others are spending.  Less resistance. Ray, Thank you, for this great data, This information is must to be Taught within our Education System., 🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏🤝💯👑 who\\'s here after the Fed turned the interest rate to nearly 0 in 2020?

We have reached the stage of Helicopter Money worldwide. All currencies are hyperinflating. The dollar appears to be strong not because anyone is buying American products, even Iran makes Mach 14 missiles. We can\\'t. Our Pentagon is too busy stuffing Missing Money in their pockets to be bothered with defending America. Dr Mark Skidmore from government sources showed that $21 trillion has gone missing from DOD and HUD. The demand for dollars comes from crazy men who borrowed in dollars and invested in yuan. That looked good for a while. Now they have to liquidate their Chinese and Third World holdings to buy dollars to pay off their loans.\\nJanuary 1,2020 Total US Debt .23,201,380,134,806.73\\nWow. The deficit since the first of this year is more than a trillion dollars!! And I am irresponsible? You have entered the Helicopter Money era.\\nIf we had Lincoln\\'s Greenbacks instead of Federal Reserve Notes, there would be no $24 trillion national debt. \\nLet me now predict that on May Day, 5-01-2020 that the total deficit for the first 4 months of 2020 will be more than $2 trillion.\\nWhat is your prediction for the total deficit for 2020?\\nHow long will foreigners continue to accept I Owe You Nothing Federal Reserve Notes as if they were gold bars?\\nThere is a solution. It involves getting our country back from Wall Street Bankers. David Rothkopf wrote Superclass. He was CEO of Kissinger Associates. He says the world is run by 30 families and their 6,000 minions. One of their meeting grounds for the transmission of their desires into our laws is the annual Bilderberg Society meeting. I wrote this:\\nDebt Cancellation Is The Best Way To Take Down Bilderberg\\n https://vidrebel.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/debt-cancellation-is-the-best-way-to-take-down-bilderberg/ \\u200b@Horse237 I think you need to chill with your \"vision\" nonsense. I assume you have pure intentions at heart but you completely fail to consider the unfathomable consequences that would come with introducing a completely new currency out of thin air. The US dollar is the strongest currency in the world today. 70% of the world\\'s transactions rely on it, and countless economies around the world either have adopted it as their national currency or peg their currency to it. Suddenly introducing a new monetary system, mind you within a simple 4-year term, is irresponsible and outright impossible. I appreciate you exploring concepts that might (in theory) reduce the total debt in the world over the long run, but considering the millions if not billions of people it would drive into unemployment, along with the required economic restructuring spanning decades, your idea is, unfortunately, nothing but a fantasy. Your so INFORMATIVE! Thanks for all the info😥👍 @makthemax The cycle is a cycle of debt creation. That stops with Dr Irving Fisher\\'s 100% money. No government debt. No interest on the debt. All printed money and all checking account money are created by the US Treasury. No more will a depositor put $10 into the bank so the Banker can loan out $100. That is why our recessions and booms and Depressions have been called part of a credit cycle. End it. No more loaning money into creation.\\nWe bought things for free from overseas by printing up worthless paper. That gave America a far higher standard of living than it earned. 60% of our money is overseas. When foreigners refuse to sell for dollars, they will send the money to the US where it more than doubles our money supply cutting our wages in half. Outstanding presentation. Please make a follow up to reflect these principles in practice at present, of the huge economic downfall as impacted by Covid-19. Thank you. I just discover that I live in a feudal country, thanks for this lesson. Who else also came here from \"Money: Master the Game\" book?  I Read it two years ago. I really wish he would do more videos breaking down things like this... Pro tip:- watch this video 10 times probably every week You\\'ll get more in your head shiny x yeah because you know more than the worlds biggest hedge fund manager who’s worth $19 BILLION DOLLARS right? @shiny x lol what a joke...

Western Australia is God\\'s own country... Ive been to WA 3 times and every time I never want to leave. Perth\\'s so pretty and its just heaven on earth! No better place to be WA Zzzzz Bro this is my dream country as tourism , wildlife etc. AGREED 100% I’ve lived in all capitals and Perth wins hands down This is why I live in Australia 🇦🇺 jedeni rebekha tmi Ss passion https://youtu.be/JwncAQurlqk https://youtu.be/aLBuaiJM37E @jedeni rebekha I\\'m from Australia Where do u live in Australia Some other places I would recommend to visit is \\n1. tangalooama on morten island you do dolphin feeding , parasailing , helicopter ride and quad bike ride up a forest track. \\n2. The great ocean road that is close to Melbourne. Melbourne has some beautiful vineyards and has a beautiful coastal line. \\n2. The Whitsundays islands is honestly most beautiful thing you can see. It is expensive to stay on the island it’s cheaper to stay on arlie beach and catch a boat to the islands. \\n3. white haven and that has been voted on of the beautiful beach in the world. \\n4. Thredbo the best ski place for family and friends in Australia absolutely fun and who doesn’t love snow. In nsw\\n5. Double island point great camping place and absolutely beautiful beach \\n6. The fairy pools in Noosa in Sunshine Coast bit of a walk through Noosa national park but the walk itself has beautiful view the entire way and has small beaches on the way. Noosa is beautiful but good luck finding a park \\n7. The southern lights you can see in Australia it’s about 2 hours I think from Melbourne where you can stay in a cabin and there is a observatory for the lights. \\n8. Dreamworld , movie world , wet n wild and sea world of course all in Gold Coast \\n9. Bryon bay the vide is very chill beautiful beaches \\n10. The blue mountains outside Sydney \\n\\nThere is more but that’s all I can think of that I know all these places can be found Queensland, New South Wales Victoria ( I’m from Queensland and been to Victoria and New South Wales so don’t know much about beautiful places in other states but I do hear Tasmania and Western Australia is absolutely beautiful) I’ve been to the great ocean road and the best location among it is the 8 apostles Nice u Hey dear, need your feedback about this video, this is Kashmir the heaven on earth \\nhttps://youtu.be/M_Oj6W9x0_4 Thank you for taking your time with the list. Byron Bay is the best place I\\'ve ever been. I highly recommend everyone just go to Byron and learn how to chill. I love Australia and Australian people. @The Mason Experience yes Glad to hear u love Australian people otherwise that would be an awkward comment hahah SAME HERE I love more I’m flattered Australia is absolutely gorgeous! I have to visit one day😍 Yes i wish the same The same to you wish Australia 😀 I like and wish vist all parts of  Australia . But i have not invitational senders . Pls if you can invite me i can visit this greater country . Not problem about transportation money , i have not persons . Visit? heck naw im moving there! Not visit wish to live there me watching this during Quarantine :( I hope to visit the Australian land ,beautiful special city,I love you Australian people thanks . Sounds good mate. Just don\\'t say Australia land or kola bear here because you\\'ll probably get made fun of by us Jealousy is a curse It’s not a city it is a country smh No go away ur no welcome Just remember Sydney is overrated I love Australia ❤ and the Australian people 😊 I am from India and I want to be friendship with you please 🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹❤❤❤where are you from Australia is so cool!! joseph G yes it is cool That last beach was Manly Beach......much nicer than Bondi Beach and bigger - and also a lovely trip on the Manly Ferry on Sydney Harbor to get there especially at sunset! I with my wife .son&grand daughter simranjeet kaur quinzland.gold cost.light house.beach of gold cost .that place are beautifut.otherwise All Australia is beautiful.my grand daughter 6years old.she is very like to Autralia. Agreed Bondi beach is small and too crowded. America: we’re the richest and best country!!!\\nAustralia: hold our beaches and nature us australians invented wifi and chicken salt Thats a really bad comparison and most aussies will tell you The outback is the most amazing part of Australia. Take a drive from Broken Hill to Flinders Ranges to Coober Pedy. You will never forget it! Brilliant. The sounds, colours, textures, fauna and fawna, and scents of the outback/bush is the true representation of Australia.  Even if you are a city person to truly experience the heart and uniqueness of Australia you need to visit the bush. Toby Loebel   Been all over this great country. All the good/nice/beautiful places are literally thousands of km from anything in most cases and from each other. It’s ok if you like driving and the reward of the spectacle is big. But if you don’t like traveling by road. It’s not for you. @marvin martin its worth it you just probably haven\\'t been on the drive. Jim Crawford   From where?   Melbourne? It’s not far at all, go and see the beautiful Flinders Ranges. From Broken Hill it is a beautiful trip, I have done it quite a few times from Canberra. I can tell all the place I have been visit and living in all major capital city. Best living place it’s Sydney, most fun place to visit it’s Whitsunday Island & Great Barrier Reef ❤️❤️❤️ I\\'m in Australia and I\\'m really enjoying to be here 😘😘😘😊 I live in WA .. So isolated, so beautiful , lots of sun,sea and sand. Been there last year, so beautiful 😍😍 Hi! How is it over there? From Sydney, NSW Yes a WA friend This is my dream when I will go I definet look those places✌👍 Australia is a heaven for beach lovers ❤️❤️❤️ Wow thats great never been in Australia but looking at these I feel like its could me so much fun.

I\\'m Australian We all love AUSTRALIA , God  bless AUSTRALIA. 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺 I live in Canada 🇨🇦 I spent close to a year travelling through Australia it was great, All of you slagging off the English are funny. Do you realise that since the founding of Australia in 1788 until today in 2020 the largest immigrant population by far has always been the English? We built AUS when it was nothing but wilderness and now you want to slag us off once we build a country everyone wants a part of? Typical lol @PlymouthtoLeedsonaXCHST Who cares what you do. You\\'re an idiot and we wouldn\\'t want another one like you here. EDIT: I KNEW YOU WERE THE POM Bwahahahahahahaha PlymouthtoLeedsonaXCHST     Between 35 - 50,000 Brits emigrate to Australia annually, and they don\\'t seem to have a problem with being \\'slagged off\\'.  It\\'s a different matter though when they start looking down on people as they do the N. Irish, Scots, and meditteraneans.  They earn their reputation.  A high percentage of Brits came to Oz as £10-poms in the 50s & 60s, they and their offspring have no intention of ever leaving @Name And Address Supplied What do say to the English,calling us poms is racists.I would never go to Australia,everyone knows they despise us even Americans have told me this.Good job we are the two furthests countries apart. @PlymouthtoLeedsonaXCHST It\\'s only the whinging Poms we have a go at. The Irish, Scots & Welsh we have no problem with. I bet you\\'re the Pom. Wow, I love Australia Yeah I live 10 hour drive NW of cairns I\\'ve been to all these places already 😥 Perfect👍😀.\\nHappy new year Fun Fact: \\n\\nUluru (Ayers Rock) is known as the largest monolith in the world and is over 8km wide at its widest point. ooooohhhh someone read the brochure!! I always wanted to go to Australia,now, this makes me wanna go even more! Victoria Hang Decker i was replying to ben hall btw Thank you guys for answering!

Ben Hall both of those have been gone for a while I’ve moved to Sydney 10 years ago and still living here. I highly recommend to visit this country. It’s so beautiful with pure nature and people are so friendly and easy going, the culture, the vibe and everything. Victoria Hang Decker Maybe wait just a little for things to recover from the fires and the floods. Then it’ll be the trip of a lifetime. Great country it\\'s my dream to travel Australia in my life What a great country☺️☺️ I also feature some hidden gems in this beautiful country😍 I miss my homeland a lot. hope to come back one day and touch the Australian soil again.I am proud to be an Aussie.

       " 'Who came here just for the Jesus in the thumbnail. Ana Ber-Ado . . . Sorry. I didn’t have time to go through 344 replies to figure out what you are responding to. @SiSenor i did. Before The Jesus on the right side of the thumbnail is based on the creator\\'s opinion rather than anything \"scientific\". Jesus probably wasn\\'t as white as the left picture, but we don\\'t really know. Some Middle Easterners today and many historical figures from there in the past looked white. The Middle East is the crossroads of empires so there is a smattering of different people from black, brown, olive-skinned, white, etc. though it\\'s mostly brown and olive-skinned. Look up pictures of Ibrahim Al-Douri. @Bubba Jones I know about the Taklamakan mummies. There\\'s mummies in Peru and Alaska, too. Heck, there\\'s a mummified lizard in the hinges of my back door. I guess it must have had fair hair.\\nI know about Sanskrit.\\n5000 years is a long time.\\nSpanish and French have been going their own way for about 1500 years, and I dare you to understand and speak one from knowing the other.\\nEnglish and Sanskrit are NOT closely related. @Bubba Jones Dude, just because you get it from a screen doesn\\'t mean it ain\\'t a drug. Christopher Columbus is the guy who comments first on a Youtube video that\\'s already had 1 million views. @The forgotten Hero: Haji Shariatullah Really.  I will look it up.  But it seems unlikely that someone from a landlocked nation would do such a think. Many believe that, Abu Raihan of Uzbekistan discovered the Americas @Curtis Hollerback Also.  I always question what I am taught.  I don\\'t think you question anything.  You sound like you are repeating the liberal bull the left has been indoctrinating young people with for three decades.   You call ignorant someone who disagrees with you and your foolish statements about changing history.  I would think that new information would be the only reason to change history.  Not new political attitudes.   You don\\'t want truth you want your side to win.   No.  You just want to sound cool.  Those are the dangerous people, they go along with what they think is popular.  They are the easiest people to whip into a mob. @Curtis Hollerback You loud mouthed bigot.  I brought up you failings.   Thanks for you nastiness.   You have defined your self as the enemy that I thought you were. Please don\\'t have a nice life and I wish you misery and sorrow for all the days of your life. @John Edward Gallagher most people like you John, are total idiots. Who believe what they are taught and never question the bullshit they are fed! I personally like to hear other people\\'s comments, even if I disagree. I never try to BS beat my opinion by shaming someone with my education or lack of! Unless I was named after a toilet, then It\\'s o.k. I suppose. It\\'s none of your business what I do or where I have been, nor what I have done or accomplished. If you don\\'t like my comment \\'troll on\\' as I have seen, you seem to be the author of many of these comments. Go and worship your pedafile pope! And realise he had absolutely nothing to do with Christ! Nor Chris Columbus! IDGaF who they name something after. It probably was not correct in the first place! 500 years ( or 2000 ) of LIES don\\'t make something true! If you start with a boat with holes, and keep adding holes. 20 years of holy patch ain\\'t goin to help! It\\'s time to go boat shopping for a new boat! I am totally sure of myself or I would not have commented, and I do not need someone to force me to backdown on my opinion. Columbus and De Leon and Cortez were ( and many since ) just murderers. I was taught to respect them cause they planted a flag in someones yard for the King and Queen. I don\\'t need to go on. And I really do not need your approval or disapproval to go on with my life. Have a nice life, and enjoy some coffee when you wake up. Stick to wacking watermelons! Remember not to believe everything you see or hear on the internet, that include this video and this statement as well. You got that right this video is not accurate @Wars Lord Wasn\\'t questioning colombus\\'s morality. I was talking about how the video was wrong. @JollFlame8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEw8c6TmzGg Huh @Party hat animate 😂😂😂😂😂😂 A video about dispelling myths, with more myths. @Sharkey Chumbag your a underrated comment. The dude didnt ask for your rudeness. A very underrated comment! If you’re looking for some ground breaking shit here, you’re going to be sorely disappointed Jesus born in the middle east but looking like a Swedish rock star . Cause he\\'s Jesus @JaquelynChan the Bible or Torah are not the only reference to Jesus\\' miracle birth. The Quran, Islam holy book, also tell the similar story although a bit different.\\nJesus (Isa bin Maryam/Mary AS) were created by the \"word\" of God (Allah, literally means the \"Ilah\" or The God): kun faya kun (be, and it happen). Just like how the universe were created according to The Quran. Mary/Maryam depicted in The Quran as the BEST woman in the entire world. She even has an entire chapter in the Quran, called surah Maryam. Her family also mentioned in the surah Al-Imraan (The Imran Family). Jesus/Isa AS (alaihi salam/peace be upon him) also had miracles: able to talk when he was still infant/baby, change clay bird into real bird, resurrect the dead, cured lepers, etc. All those are stated in The Quran.\\nThe Quran was revealed to Muhammad SAW, an arab man, an arab descendant. But not even once his mother (Aminah RA) or his family are mentioned in the Quran. Instead, Mary/Maryam is there. A jewish woman as the best woman in the world in front of arab people? Why did he do that? Why didn\\'t he put his own mother in The Quran? It is because Muhammad SAW wouldn\\'t dare to change anything revealed to him by The God (Allah).\\nIslam recognizes four holy books: Zabur (revealed to Daud/David AS), Torah (revealed to Musa/Moses AS), Injil/Bible (revealed to Isa/Jesus AS), and Quran. Also recognizes all the 25 prophets as holy men, pure at heart. They may made mistakes, but no sin. Muslims must respect and love all those prophets. All those prophets carried the same message: There is no god but The God (Allah).\\nAtheists always denied the existence of God. But as The Quran stated that they are just ignoring the fact the the universe itself is the prove of The God\\'s existence. Atheist always stated that there is no God and the nature created/managed itself. That means that \"nature\" is actually the atheists\\' God.\\nIt is your choice not to have a religion. And I respect that choice. But you can never able to prove that there is no God. Since the proof is yourself and the universe that you are in. @Umberto van staden And so am I... About 2000 years after Jesus. I\\'m a white guy born in Africa... @JaquelynChan I\\'m a scientist. Science says no such thing.\\nLIAR. There was no Palestine during Jesus\\'s life, it was called Judea. TODAY\\'s \"JEWS\" are a Religious bunch...their Ancestors came from every nation... @Buster Nutt How very articuate and economically expressed.If I only knew what you were referring to though. @Buster Nutt Perhaps you should look at the numerous books that have been written in the last decade which could not find objective and substantiated historical proof of this character Jesus, as portrayed in the bible, referencing many historians of the time, Greek and Roman....the bible seems to be the most compelling source and if you want to go on that.....cool for you! @peyton quinn - BS @Werner Gansert - Recorded history says so. We\\'ve been lied to about so many things throughout history, who knows what our history REALLY is? \"French inches are longer than English inches.\"   Welp boys, you know what we gotta do XD So you\\'re saying all men are French in the brain?  LOL So wait if soemone in france is 6.5 in French inches means in American inches there 7.2? Actually their inch was the same they had 13 inches in a foot instead of 12. All that info and that\\'s the one thing you got lol.. Ellie Horne 😬 Doesn’t it clearly state that Jesus’ hair was like wool and his feet the color of brass? @1Always Dreaming Dream on Revelations says  his head and hairs were WHITE LIKE WOOL. @1Always Dreaming good Lord!! I\\'m so GDamed sick of this BS!! Unfortunately you can\\'t claim everything... Sometimes you just have to say it is WTF it is!! And quit the CRAP!! Yes, but those stories in the bible are the people who wrote it, their perception of what they saw!! Doesn\\'t make it true!! The bible was written by many different men during different times over a period of time!!!  And remember that they are stories!!! @1Always Dreaming Egypt is in North Africa which is not Sub-Saharan Africa. Blacks in America are mostly from West Africa not North Africa. What did Napoleon say. “History is a set of lies agreed upon”. No wonder, COVID19 & AFTERLIFE are been FORCED down our throats!!!!!!!!

This guy\\'s trying to neutralize things but is still being culturally biased. He really didn\\'t learn much from this \"research\". Unfortunately hunny history was my Minor in college, and he\\'s just about right on all of his points!! If you feel that he\\'s being\"culturally biased\", I\\'m sorry you feel that way; but... You don\\'t know how much we have ALL been B-Stted in school!! They want us to believe that all of these people were the first ones to do this or that; but the history books were written by people who didn\\'t get it right!!! So, you can\\'t teach the truth and facts about history, when the books aren\\'t even right!! I wanted to be an archeologist, but I wound up being a drug and alcohol counselor instead!! But history is my favorite subject, so therefore I paid attention!!! The dude on the thumbnail is one of the, “ BeeGees” band members from the 70s. @Andrew_koala the bee gees weren\\'t real? that\\'s a new conspiracy. what, were the bee gees made by the government? were they lizard people? was their music made by satan? @Andrew_koala The BeeGees existed in the 1970\\'s...with songs in 1977 movie STAYING ALIVE. @Andrew_koala That is true. I was just reading the New Testament, where He (Jesus Gibb) went back to kanaän, singing the song \\'Back To Massachusetts\". Obviously, his donkeys GPS wasn\\'t up to par, either. The BeeGees never existed in the 70\\'s  ... That was 1,950 years ago.\\nLearn how to use a calendar.\\nIt is only the smarter people that make up for your incompetency on how a calendar functions.\\nObviously, you are not a full box of chocolates and mentally lazy. Good One~!! I was thinking of Fabio. \"History is written by the victor.\" I was mostly surprised that i knew most of this. 7 out of 10 !\\nThe others i suspected. Even as a child i asked why Jesus was white and others from that region were not. Too bad that by “Discovery of America” you had to plaster the States’ flag, when in reality “The discovery of America”, so named by Vespuci, means the entire landmass, from Canada all the way down to Uruguay, including the Caribbean as well I would think if anyone sailed to america and found people then they didnt discover shit , just saying @Rollin McKim https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg Here it is. The word \"America\" is in the southern hemisphere. @Rollin McKim Thank you! I looked it up. https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0309/maps.html (would youtube let me include a link?), It says\"In that work, Vespucci concluded that the lands reached by Columbus in 1492 and explored by Columbus and others over the ensuing two decades were indeed a segment of the world, a new continent, unknown to Europe. Because of Vespucci\\'s recognition of that startling revelation, he was honored with the use of his name for the newly discovered continent. It is remarkable that the entire Western Hemisphere was named for a living person; Vespucci did not die until 1512.\" Please note the word \"continent.\" The whole Terra Incognita. This was way before the United States existed. Don\\'t know if the map in the Library of Congress, the FIRST showing \"America\" on a map, will agree with you.  My memory is not too great.  Do believe it was the Vespuci map, though. I can\\'t stand it when the stupid country I live in is called America!! It\\'s the United States! Nothing fooled me. Jesus is real and DNA was found on the shroud of Turin...you are debunked as a fool.. Apple has denied that they have ever assaulted Sir Issac Newton. Everyone knows Samuel Sung invented the telephone. hydrolito r/woosh How can an apple talk? And the tree was the witness 😂 Lol 1:20 - This is the most ignorant thing I\\'ve heard on this channel. Yes, actually, she was being purposefully disobedient. @Carmen Dilcherd So you\\'re telling me she was NOT being purposefully disobedient when she refused to give up her seat for a white man? Unfortunately having been a history major in college, unfortunately he\\'s right!! But Rosa Parks still did change the world with her movement, it\\'s sad that people are so stuck on what they read in the books in school and what they were told to make it sound good; but unfortunately like I said, he\\'s right yea i know it totally discredited everything else in this video 5:16 \\n*Flat-earthers have left the chat.* Good One~!! Palestine didnt exist during jesus time it was 40 years after his death that the roman changed the name from judae to palestine.... so why you calling him a palestinian jewish man ... your are continuing the lies.. @Sergio Alcantara The land is called ISrael Mark Ian Apolonio you are right. There is no letter P in Arabic but Palestine in Arabic does not start with a P, it starts with an F فلسطين. The issue is with translation. Your example should be added to the Video bc it’s wrong Jancy Varghese yep! i don\\'t believe everything I\\'ve heard especially the last 12 minutes of crap I don\\'t like when people say \"someone looks like Jesus\", when we truly don\\'t know what Jesus looks like. Patexiss read revelations 1-14-15 we all know revelations means to revel so in this verse it tells you what he look like sis you’ve been misinformed it was a record keep because it The messiah know that the would change the faces of the judges to look like them Ain\\'t it the truth, P?\\n\\nJesus looked like Love, I have to believe.\\n\\nSTILL DOES!!!!\\n\\n.\\n\\nPS:  Cute mask!  Got me a Zorro Mask a while into Covid, have yet to wear it.    Here in the South, I am all too likely to be shot as a robber with that kind of mask on!!!\\n\\nPerhaps to church, one day?    No, too many people carrying at my church, I\\'m one of them!!! @Pal Ashford The picture you paint is most likely very close if not spot on. We can certainly have an idea what he looked like. We know the average height of the Israelites during Roman occupation, which was about 5\\'3\", not 5\\'6\". Maybe the Romans were that tall because they were well fed. We know that the yolk of Rome was around the Jews\\' necks, that many had malnutrition, which would cause hair loss and distended bellies. They lived a harsh life in a desert without any sun screen so probably had the face of a roadmap. Look at any Middle Eastern peasant today, and that pretty much is what Jesus looked like. He certainly didn\\'t look like a strapping Italian from Mel Gibson\\'s Passion of the Christ, or some blue-eyed European, that\\'s for damn sure. @FreedomExperiment  Turn the other cheek\" is probably the most misunderstood phrase in the Bible. In no way was Jesus teaching his disciples to be passive, a pushover or weak. Quite the opposite. Remember, at the time of Jesus the Roman Empire controlled that region, and all who lived there, with an iron fist. It was common for a Roman soldier to slap the face (or worse) of anyone he saw as beneath him that angered him for whatever reason. In those days that Roman soldier would’ve used the back of his hand to slap the face of anyone he considered beneath him. A slap to the face with the palm of the hand was only for those considered to be equal in status or higher. Turning the other cheek was an act of defiance. Turning the other cheek demonstrated that no harm had been done and offering the palm side cheek as a target meant the one being slapped saw him/herself as an equal to the one slapping. Slapping with the palm of the hand would have meant the soldier agreed with their being equal. There were also strict rules in place for Roman soldiers regarding the treatment of the population. Backhanding a Jew for getting in your way was fine but more than that, for minor offenses, could get you in real trouble. \\n\\nAnother example is when marching it was acceptable to force any Jewish male to carry a soldier’s belongings, but only for one mile. Most would stop at exactly one mile which at the time was 1,000 paces. Jesus tells us to take the sting out of the situation by being willing to carry such a burden an extra mile with a cheerful attitude. Just like turning the other cheek there is defiance and the possibility of getting your oppressor in trouble. \\n\\nThis, along with some other examples I’ll share next, is the reason some call Christianity the “second mile religion”. \\n• To love your neighbor is the first mile - to love your enemy is the second mile\\n• To bless those who bless you is the first mile, - to bless those who curse you is the second mile\\n• To do good to those who do good to you is the first mile - to do good to those who hate you is the second mile\\n• Praying for those who pray for you is the first mile - praying for those who spitefully use you is the second mile\\n\\nIn Luke 22:36 Jesus said to the disciples, \"But now the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag; and the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.\" (New Revised Standard Version, NRSV)\\n\\nThere are differing opinions about this directive from Jesus but, like all things in life, we choose to believe what we want to believe. I believe the side that says Jesus was preparing his disciples for life without him that would include many dangers they had yet to face. I personally believe (actually I know) evil does exist in this world and I have every right to resist it. I also believe I have a moral obligation to defend the innocent from evil when and where I am able.\\n\\nI agree that having some water sprinkled on your head doesn’t make you a Christian, accepting Jesus into your heart and living as He directed, to the best of your ability, does.\\n\\nI have known some fake Christians in my 54 years but I have also known many true Christians. The true Christians were the same every day of the week, they did their best to live as Jesus taught. Some would never have used deadly force to save their life if attacked while others would. I am one that certainly will defend my life and the life of another if I’m ever in the position. \\n\\nRomans 3;3 “all fall short of the glory of God”. That includes me, you and every other human being on earth. It includes Donald trump, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, George Washington and even Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Everyone! \\nThe vast majority of the Christians you slander as liars donate the most to charities, are the first to offer aid to those in need, give of their time to those around them without ever asking or expecting anything in return and would never use a firearm in an offensive manner. Perhaps you should reconsider what you choose to believe because from my perspective your misinterpretation of just four words has allowed a lot of hate to grow in your heart. Hate for people who do not deserve it. \\n\\nI’m curious, would you defend your life with deadly force if attacked by someone intent on killing you or would you simply allow your life to be taken? \\n\\nSelf preservation is the strongest of all basic instincts which God (if you believe in God) put into every living thing. Do you really think Jesus is telling us that God was wrong? The Bible specifically describes Yeshua . Some people just have a problem with the description .  Thats on them at their own peril . Where in the Bible is this so called description.  Tell me were it is please. @Cnith TheOnliestOne Rev 1:14-15 What\\'s the description? Exactly....it has perfect description but they running away from the fact “New-found-land” lol BE AMAZED: Vikings never had horns\\nDENMARK explaining that it was only for the royal and not for battle The man in the thumbnail is a neanderthal There\\'s only one true fact to history: you\\'ll never truly know what happened unless you were there.🤷🏻\\u200d♂️ @Darren Robinson Because people are gullible and need a reason to exist. Well that\\'s right, so why do you still worship a fairy tale ? The statement that these misconceptions are \"lies\" imply an intentional act.   Inaccuracies are closer the mark.  There is little malfeasance in most of these, nor are most of these inaccuracies still commonly held by people.    I am 55 years old and we were taught in elementary school that Columbus was not the first european to discover america.  Leaf Ericson was, now that has been called into question with the theory about subalturans.   The information was not a lie in was inaccurate.   The representation of Christ started with local models either of local God images prior to christianity or more likely local people used as models.  The image then became traditional and recognizable and therefore repeated.     There are no descriptions of Christ for their to be lies about.   Nothing was an intentional.  In early non european cultures that adopted christianity the representations of Jesus resemble the local peoples of the region they were created in.   No plotting involved.  Many renaissance paintings with biblical themes even have the figures dressed in the clothing of that era they were painted in.  Early renaissance art has baby Jesus not looking like a baby at all but like a miniature adult.  It is local tradition, not an intentional lie.   Uniformed and primitive creativity, not modern accuracy were the decisive factors.   Not lies.  We are certainly living in an era that is very Byzantine like, in that everyone has become iconoclastic with just about everything. @David Sheppard Why point out something that was not intended as such.  I would rather look at an anglo Jesus.  And coptic Christian from ethiopia might rather look at a black jesus.  Not out of racism but because of what we are used to.  The entire thing is designed to help people be offended when no offence was meant or given.   They just what to create more victims angry over nothing. @David Sheppard That is why I object to videos like these.  The are pointed at kids or very simple people who are easily led.  This type of video will do one of two things.  Lead some to hate the west and others to be reactionary.   Both things are divisive and will lead to trouble.   In makers of such video have one of two reasons as well.  They are either virtue signaling to excise some guilt they feel or they are intentionally trying to break down \"the west\" for thier own selfish political short term ends.  Or of course to make money. John Edward Gallagher this video was pointed at people with no critical thinking skills. Kids... the Jesus thing is soo Obvious only an idiot would think he looked like  an Anglo. Maybe history should describe him as a troll...Europeans would have run. When selling beer, Miller shows beautiful people in relaxing settings with their beautiful spouses. If Miller was accurate it would show an unattractive guy half drunk talking too much. But nobody wants to identify with that...lol @Benjamin Facouchere I will accept you answer and information and truth then.  I take you at your word.  It is however a political machination that many historical \"facts\" are being destroyed by the left and in education because of an ideal to somehow change humanity.   i think that is a real problem in this world and I no longer believe academics to be truthful. @John Edward Gallagher I \"jumped on\" that one because you only mentioned that, what should I have \"jumped on\" instead?\\nAlso didn\\'t want to attack you, just inform you of the current situation in case you have heard of the Solutrean hypthesis a few decades ago and still thought it would be current.\\nThe hypothesis is basically dead now, the people ascribed to as Solutreans because of their fishhooks have now been genetically identified as of Proto-Siberian descent. \"Watson, come here, I want you.\"\\nAlexander Graham Bell,\\nNot the true inventor of the telephone, just an early LGBT activist. @ 6:27 “suposably” cmon man! The images of Jesus being white may have come from Da Vinci\\'s The Last Supper. The commonly held appearance of Jesus is Byzantine in nature He\\'s probably not white @JaquelynChan could you show us where science says this ? Lmao , keep making things up . Science is still unable to disprove it and most if not all the fathers of modern science believed in god . Also the image of a Woman to his right called Mary Magdalene~!! I love when you worthless mongrels talk about the history of my land... you\\'re all so ignorant and uneducated hahahaha I love this. People have been too carried away by the stories that they just question nothing Remember, don\\'t believe everything you hear or read. I find mistakes in \"Be Amazed\" all the time. What do you disagree with? Especially if the \"facts\" are as accurate as his pronunciation. touche The way you\\'ve pronounced \\'der ring des nibelungen\\' and \\'meucci\\' really hurts Maybe the narrator is not a native English speaker? Why people have to be natzi grammar all the time? Especially people who only speak one language, English? Yes - that was painful to listen to. Well growing hair was a tradition in jewish religion before , back to the time of judges. @Joseph Sapitula But Jesus wasn\\'t a priest. He was specifically excluded by the priests. They wanted him crucified! He certainly was not welcome in the synagogue. He was exposing their corruption and wrongful ways, which pissed them off insufferably. To imitate the appearance of a priest would probably have been a crime (much as dressing like a monk in a Buddhist country falsely is a crime today) and quite likely would have gotten him killed for blasphemy much sooner. See Juwish Priest. Shoulder lenght hair and long beard. \"History is filled with lairs...\"- captain price Its filled with liars to........ Ooooo someone gets it...but...\"mission fail, well get em next time\"😂 Damn those evil lairs But not the bible read it *Religion in a nutshell* Jesus IS  SO wonderful that people (want )Him to look like them.😢 Now THAT is Crystal clear!!! James Marshall there’s no physical evidence king Ramesse was way before Jesus and there’s physical evidence @Paula Catlover he WAS a real person its a fact its just that people argue over the fact that he was able to perform miracles or do unnatural things The white Christian dominion crazies in history forced people to convert. They think he looks like them. He\\'s fictional anyway. theres not really any pictures of him i dont think so no one really knows \"Be Amazed,\" he titles it. Well, I am amazed. I\\'m amazed that each of his \"exposés\" had factual errors, but I\\'ll point out just one: \\n\\nHe claims the Shroud of Turn \"has been debunked as Renaissance art.\" Not only was the Shroud known long before the Renaissance, but repeated microscopic and chemical investigations have shown that the image contains no paint or any other substance that would have been used by artists of that time or earlier times. Yes ...down with youtube...they sold out to advertising...it\\'s all bull crap now... Pity, I had to scroll so far down to see this comment. Just the title and they way they spin the \"non-facts\" prays on people\\'s ignorance got on my nerves. I have checked and they still haven’t done the testing yet so we still don’t know and even if it is 2.000 years old there is absolutely no evidence to say who it actually is And dna testing has been shown to be about 2000 years old You are right, there\\'s several inconsistencies with the content of this video. Most people won\\'t pay attention to your comment. They don\\'t know. 6:58 hold on.  giles corey was a real guy?  i thought it was just a generic name used in town of salem...  wow im an idiot... Most Christians don\\'t realize that Jesus was a Jew, not a Christian. He probably never would have promulgated the rise of Christianity. He would have enhanced Judaism. 10:35 What you came for.. God bless you\\nNoice Thaaaaank you! thanks Thaaaaanks lol, sorry. I meant \"buddy\" Why not have a narrator who can correctly pronounce common names and other nouns? Might make your videos more believable For we have ALL sinned, and fallen short of the Glory of God. @craig stewart Yeah, \"supposaBly!\" @Eric Bradley Agreed. I tend to be critical when a video is made on a subject and the narrator is unfamiliar with many pronunciations. It\\'s just the nature of cranking out these programs. @craig stewart I can see your point. But since the video actually stresses that we can\\'t trust everything we hear, I think we should give him a free pass on his speech errors (for which we don\\'t know the reason, and he could have a really good one). @Eric Bradley It all comes down to credibility. When I hear a narrator that doesn\\'t know the way to pronounce subjects of his video, I question whether it is a well researched presentation. I only came to see if the Titanic had really hit a giant iceberg. I blame the 1st class passenger who ask for lots of ice in his drink. idk if you got your answer, but it did, it just sank because the damage the fire did weakened the hull causing it to break easily. Fate writers:\" WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN\" 2:31 Yeah... I seriously doubt that was considered beautiful in ANY culture. Yes I Know All Of The History Of The World Is A Lot Of Lies Cristober Colon Not everything in history is a lie, it\\'s just that the majority of it is. Yes, history is a lot of lies just like your freakishly weird obsession to capitalize the first letter of every word in a sentence is annoying, but here we are. @Timbo White neynot you a lie Timbo White you are Let \\'s see him hundreds of years later when he descends again to kill his false counterpart. \"Wagner\" is pronounced VAHG-ner and \"Newfoundland\" is pronounced NEW-finned-lend.

They were all murdered and returned to life.\\xa0\\nThe writer about Jesus was Paul of Tarsus, who drew on stories of these gods.\\nWhen ancient Rome began to collapse, people needed someone to bring them hope. The Roman Emperor Constantine proclaimed Christianity to be the new Roman religion- the law of the land. Gone were the old Roman gods like Apollo and Jupiter. The rich and powerful Roman Empire put all its weight behind Paul\\'s new religion about Jesus. The rest, as they say, is history.\\nSo, did Jesus really walk in the Middle East or is that what this video calls, \"a lie told by the history books\"?  Scholars debate this, and like the other things this video mentions, each person must decide for themselves. and what a coincidence that everyone who apposed the central bank were all on the ship and died. and the u.s.a would be governed a lot differently if they had of remained alive. accident? i think not! “This is for the record. History is written by the victor. History is filled with liars. If he lives, and we die, his truth becomes written - and ours is lost.

So who was the Victor? I\\'ve never heard \"Giles\" pronounced in such a way. or \"BI-ZON-TEEN\"...🤔😂 Nobody truly know what Jesus looks like, how tall he is, what color his eyes are, and whether he wore a robe or not.🤦\\u200d♂️ Rose C true but it does not say what he look like in the Bible, which was all I was tryna point out Except for the thousands of other people he preached to for years during his travels, the guards that arrested him, the priests that he upset in the temple, the people who voted him off the island...but other than that no one else. Chinese feet binding was pretty harsh, I remember the real reason taught by my Chinese mother though... @Rickarama Trama   Like the clip showed,nob head. WELL=?????????????????? That whole Titanic on fire thing makes a lot of sense. \"Skin of bronze hair of wool \" seems pretty descript to me 🙄🤔 @self discarded king of ruin 72 Seriously, or you joking bro JaquelynChan science is also full of lies why would you even believe it at all? Jesus was a copper sheep @Lori Jackson your thinking about  A Nazarite and a Nazarene is someone that lives in Nazareth btw Nazareth is a ghetto not at all. We have a pretty good idea of what color his skin was and what his hair was like, but what did he look like? \"Skin of bronze hair of wool \" pretty much describes every black man on the planet, and a few others PEOPLE TRY TO REWRITE HISTORY TO THEIR LIKING !!!!!! As a Canadian I pronouce it as \"New-fin-land\" Well, we should stop spelling it in a confusing way, or people will continue to be confused. If people want it to be New Finland, then spell it that way. It seems pretty clear that whoever newly found that land wrote it that way on the map (as \"New Found Land\") and over time, progressively, many idiots mispronounced it into New Finland and the pronunciation stuck. That, however, wouldn\\'t (or shouldn\\'t) make it correct. So the spelling should be changed to New Finland, or  should pronounce it how it\\'s spelled. Pronouncing things differently to how they\\'re spelled just seems snobby and pretentious. Jesus would be on the no fly list today he was from the middle East. He would also smell like a blocked drain in an public toilet. Hmmm, so Jesus, a Jew, did not look like a Jew? Who would have thought it. but he did look like a first century jew may want to research the shroud as well as the other\\'facts\\' (lol) in this vid. laughable and outdated at best. Actually, while you\\'re better than \"common knowledge\" you are also making mistakes.\\n     Retired librarian 6:58 hold on.  giles corey was a real guy?  i thought it was just a generic name used in town of salem...  wow im an idiot... If you want to know more about Jesus, then I suggest looking for Him for yourself. He reveals Himself to those who truly seek Him. Don’t listen to man... please! If you didn’t know this about Rosa Parks, I don’t think you know much about civil rights movement. This information is common knowledge 😕 Well, it\\'s quite interesting that a video titled \"lies you were told by the history books\" actually contains a lie itself! (or inaccuracy anyway) The fire on the Titanic wasn\\'t discovered in 2017, it was a known fact ever since the inquiries that were made about the shipwreck in 1912! It was also far less destructive than you imply, since it took place in the coal bunkers of the ship and coal fires in ships at the time were quite common. Furthermore, Titanic\\'s crew knew about the fire from the first moment it started and did their best to stop it, which they actually DID two or three days into her journey. Now having said that, it is quite possible that the watertight bulkheads were weakened by the fire and gave in much sooner than they would have otherwise,  but in the end it wouldn\\'t have made THAT much of a difference in saving more people or even the whole ship! Or at least that\\'s what the inquiries in 1912 claimed. We just gonna ignore the NASA Moon landing... SHOULD have been one I\\'ve often wondered why our Lord, a middle-Eastern Jew, would have European facial features. A book, \"Heaven Is For Real,\" by Todd Burpo, has a better rendition. Todd Burpo, a Pastor, writes about his son Colton, 3 years old at the time, undergoing emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix and peritonitis, was shown Heaven by Jesus during his surgery. When asked, he said non of the pictures looked right. A self-taught artist, Akianne   Kramarik (doing this from memory, spelling may lot be right) was also shown Heaven as a 3 year-old. Holy innocents, old enough to communicate,  not old enough to form any guile. Akianne did a portrait of Jesus. When Colton saw it, he said it was the first one that looked right. That picture appears in Todd Burpo\\'s book. I love these : what they really look like videos ❤️ u made my day @Michael Zimmerman The prohibitions in Leviticus don’t apply to Christians. It is old testament , the Jewish Torah . Eating pork is an example. Jesus didn\\'t look like any of these pictures. According to Leviticus,they could not round the corners of their hair or their beard. Well, the America school system is “rewriting” every area of America history. You\\'re  giving the school system far too much credit. They aren\\'t doing the rewriting, they\\'re far too lazy, they\\'re just buying books and perpetuating lies told to them for centuries. This started long before the school system was in place. @Truth Be told Yeah! Whitey need to recognize Wakanda @dec ok that not the agenda what nation ruling and what nation paint Christ in their image. Who run the school system. It the white race and that\\'s about keep white supremacy going. They been doing this since the Renaissance @Outlaw Angel to our eternal shame, we have betrayed our ancestors The feet stuff is crazy 😱 I would run across the ocean to get away wtf their feet looked like dead mummy feet How did you know that jesus look like that did you see him before your so messed up men 😂😂 your an lier to hahaha The vikings helmets is one that i know really good because if i lived in that time then i would be a danish viking Way back in time,I was an amoeba. K, I’m not sure who doesn’t know this stuff. I’m 49 and even I learned this stuff in school. Columbus was not the first man to discover the Americas, but neither Erickson or the Red made the discovery well known overseas. Napoleon was not a midget and nothing in the Bible says that Jesus was a white guy. \\nLastly and most importantly, up to date, the Shroud of Turin has “not been debunked” as art from any period created by anybody. I have no idea where these people got that from because it’s completely false. There have been countless attempts to recreate it, not to mention extensive scientific studies &  tests which reveal its dated to the time of Jesus. Up to date no one has been able to determine  how the image was imposed unto the fabric. Plus scans of the shroud reveal the image to be in 3D. This is all public info & just in case: \\nhttps://magiscenter.com/what-is-shroud-turin-heres-what-science-says/?campaignid=1902645111&adgroupid=70858714539&adid=424637569165&utm_term=shroud%20of%20turin&utm_campaign=blog+%7C+shroud+of+turin&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8035034826&hsa_cam=1902645111&hsa_grp=70858714539&hsa_ad=424637569165&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-16930700&hsa_kw=shroud%20of%20turin&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-YTrt7Li6wIVivGzCh0amQD0EAAYASAAEgLv3PD_BwE p.s I\\'m 44 and had the same experience ;) well said! many more evidenses than claimed here. pure clickbait!

(WARNING: He will sound drunk.) .75 is more comprehensible hey I watch Crash Course on .75 and Khan Academy on 1.25. 😂 I can\\'t really focus on what I\\'m hearing cos he literally sounds drunk soo Heh I\\'m playing it on 1.25 speed to cram Ive decided to take AP Chem. \\nI\\'ve signed up for death. \\nI\\'ve decided to take AP Comp Sci at the same time. \\nI\\'ve signed up for a very painful death Comp sci was a piece of cake! I\\'m actually a cs major now. AP chem was tough but i still enjoyed it Oh god he\\'s already dead 😂😂😂 It’s not hard but u probably know that now Did you survive? everyone else: \"he talks to fast\" \\nme, speed studying: *watching on 1.75 speed, with CC, losing my mind but its working* I\\'m here because I didn\\'t pay attention in chemistry class.\\nAnd my exam is tomorrow. i would give you a like but u r at 100 and i dont want to be the one to break it:) @The person no one knows Hey, your name. Tell me about yourself so I can get to know you. Apparently no one knows you, and that would suck (for many people at least). My name is Blake, I like pretty much every field of science, synthwave music, exploring nature, philosophy, working out: what about yourself? How\\'d it go (I\\'m so late but still) Me too \\nI\\'m trying to cram everything in my head for now reading through the comments like \"none of you know what \\'crash course\\' means, do you?\" You know that people don\\'t actually read, don\\'t you? I do Hot nerdy vampire girl in your chemistry class, it gets intense *shows picture of Marceline*😂😂😂😂😂👏🏽 Adventure Time is awesome! +Shane Williams not very nerdy though.\\nHer girlfriend on the other hand... Hot cannot be in the same sentence as \"nerdy vampire girl\" I think what u meant was \"eye cancer\" Other people are complaining that you talk to fast in comments but I personally am incredibly grateful- there are so many ancient professors this website and in my lectures droning on for hours on these subjects. Thank you. The way you structure things keeps me entertained and safe from failing midterms Am I the only one who loves watching on x2 speed 😆 That\\'s so true!!! I love that he talks fast because this way he can teach tons of lessons of info into a maximum of 10-15 minutes. Way better than sitting through hours of college courses and weeks of school. Madirlblue i When hank said \"atoms are a lot like us\" I thought \"atoms are us\"  woah... yep Everything is made of atoms Anurag Singh we made of atoms but we are we Didn\\'t he mean we behave like atoms as they precede us? got  my final tomorrow time to binge watch these HAHA SAME How did you do Okeler actually he does i ve tried it Okeler saaaame😂😂😂 . . . well? did you pass? Coming in 2016: \\xa0Crash Course Relationships. They still didn’t make it... even during the pandemic :( 2020 and it still hasn\\'t happened, kinda disappointed not gonna lie 2019 is nrly gone, surely ill stop being lonely in 2020 @Baoze Lin lol @College Penetration 2019 is here,  2020 is our best hope now This is actually more complicated than a lecture from school. sis it\\'s called crash course for a reason ☺️ The E Cole’s law does not have to be learned for the basic concept of chemistry. I am taking a different chemistry class but I am understanding many things without a formula. The formula can be the most complicated, if so, but the rest is much more useful. Remember: you’re not an expert so dont think that a complicated system or concept should disengage your from learning science I\\'ve watched this so many times yet i still don\\'t understand a lot of terms!!! I disagree @Lisagb3 Seriously? I\\'m in highschool rn, about to take a test on this lmao BROOOOOOOO they even included a Bert loves Ernie joke. Wow. XD. I ship it +Golam, In Brackets same +Golam, In Brackets  Yeah, they got married.  Who didn\\'t see that coming? I\\'m screwed Ryan Ward the number of formula doesn\\'t matter if one is bad at analysation me too :\\') +lloplop How can you be screwed? There is literally one formula. My bio professor just linked this for our lesson this week, jfc. Why am I paying out the butt for school when apparently I can just watch Hank Green teach me things for free? Me: struggling with Honors chemistry and doesn’t know how to study This is how I study... @winny lol @Diya Pudota pro quarantine learners😂😂👯 @winny ayyyyyy india @Aryan Shrivastava from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Did it work because I plan on using this method when I resume.... (My Dad made me study)😢😢😢😢😢 Thanks for getting me an A! because my teacher can\\'t teach... \"Augustus is in a relationship with Hazel.\" 3:45 pm, Jan. 10th, 2012 (xD hahahha Hank) 0:12 I was waiting for a comment like this The metallic bond didn\\'t get any love here. @M K I suggest you watch Khan Academy\\'s video on atomic bonds - he goes over metallic bonding there Milan Stevic You can’t really call metallic bond an ionic one tho...it’s a very different structure and even tho it includes positive metal ions in it, there are no negative ions in there. @Milan Stevic Someone can be confused about something, if they don\\'t have the right understanding of the material. @M K metallic bond = ionic bond made up with metal ions\\n\\nin other words, all metallic bonds are ionic bonds. not every ionic bond is a metallic one.\\n\\nnothing to be confused about. @Milan Stevic im so confused please explain this is great when you already heard it and need a quick reminder :) I\\'m doing A level chemistry in the UK at the moment and although I\\'ve learnt a lot of this, I was watching this to gain a higher level of understanding before my test. I had so many epiphanies during this video, I now get how all the topic link! Thank you so much!! \"Augustus is in a relationship with Hazel.\" 0:12 \\nYou thought you could just reference your brother\\'s book and not have me notice Hank?? I SAW THAT GUS AND HAZEL REFERENCE AT THE START HANK ;_; If he\\'s talking too fast turn on the subtitles it\\'s so much better! And if you\\'re taking notes, turn on the subtitles and pause when something important pops up! 2:25 Marceline the vampire queen from adventure time? @Boys\\'n\\'Beans fair enough but don\\'t blame me if lemon king stalks u while u sleep @Diya Pudota in my eyes one is supreme the other is undesired @Boys\\'n\\'Beans they are equal sir JAKE THE DOG AND FINN THE HUMAN LIVE TOGETHER AS ONE ADVENTURE TIME @Fowzia Chowdhury no Can you guys talk about metallic bonding too? I came here bc i\\'d never heard of metallic bonds but WOOP guess i\\'ll never know I sum up to this seeing laina in 2019 makes me feel somewhat nostalgic lmao Who was that? Do not think you tricked me @ 0:58 to 0:59, Crash Course Vince Lombardi jump cut Vince Lombardi exposed minute 4:00\\nCHILDHOOD TRAUMA ALERT!!! ElBounch i know hope he\\'s ok At 5:57 seconds you can see an iron man falling columbs tuber Is this Stephen Hawking\\'s son? +charliebroc1 You do realize that only 10% of cases, Lou Gehrig\\'s disease is related to family links. He ain\\'t crippled tho THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! You have such an amazing way of explaining things! I am currently working my way through the Biology crash course but headed over here to get better understanding of the different types of bonds... you make it so easy to understand! so again... THANK YOU!! Who else is watching this before a test? Wow...... TFIOS and Twilight references AND complicated Chemistry??? This is what I call GCSE revision :D\\xa0 Can you guys make math videos? They have statistics now watch Big Shaq - Man\\'s Not Hot. Theres lots of *quick* maths for u Omg i saw MARCILYN!\\nAdventure time\\'s the best And that was a very discreet TFIOS reference I saw there... I love it when people realise in the comments that the crash course John Green and the author John Green are same 😂😂 I thought you were joking and then i looked it up his brother wrote the book, if you didnt know. Hank: *\"atoms are a lot like us\"*\\nMe, an intellectual: *\"atoms ARE us\"* that hot vampire nerdy girl is marceline (from adventure time) hahahha...hank you\\'re the best in making boring things fun. Ryouta Kise I\\'m so glad I\\'m not the only one that noticed that lol 6:13 that sneaky annotation though. good job editor. u shud be my reg chem teacher it\\'s an informal communication medium bruh. As long as you understood what the OP meant, there is absolutely nothing wrong with what the OP wrote. @FROP DESAI\\xa0Correct! :D @Urja Kohli Umm... But what if he/she intended to have a wrong spelling. Maybe it\\'s part of an inside joke. @PHIJKCHU_Yarck\\xa0so does your name. It is spelled Pikachu @Urja Kohli\\xa0and I could understand what you said, it just looked like shit. ... INFORMATION OVERLOAD!!!!!!!! Another reason why we call “Love” chemistry :) it’s just fascinating! ok but was the bert and ernie really necessary :< i\\'m scarred forever 7:25 \"The NaCl bond is, in fact, quite strong\"\\nplaces NaCl into water\\ninstantly dissolves, bond breaks XD Dude! I\\'m studying chemistry and we\\'ve been talking about bonds for weeks now. I\\'ve been watching every video on the internet and stayed uninformed. Finally I thought \"hey, wasn\\'t that channel kinda cool when you were having finals?\" and just clicked on this video. I need to admit that even though I am not even living in an English speaking country, this video has been the one that explained most. Isn\\'t that sad?\\nYou\\'re doing a great job!\\nAnd as I\\'ve already said: I ain\\'t living in an English speaking country and the pace was just great! OMG this video predicted Taylor Swift\\'s and Joe Alwyn\\'s relationship! I know in this video they might have meant Joe Jonas though 😑 then they mentioned John Mayor then Jake Gallagher I\\'m trying to pass my ap chemistry class. I\\'m stupid. Idk why my teacher wanted me in there. These videos are getting me through high school, thank you! \\'\\' i would know, i have an older brother\\'\\'\\n\\nXD same ,only i have a younger sister I remember watching this a year ago when I was taking biology realizing it was for chemistry, and now here I am in chemistry watching it again! Your passion and comical nature give chemistry a great flavor. Love your videos. 0:13 Wait, I thought Bert & Ernie were brothers? You and John are this AP Students Life Saver! Hello ! Thank you for your work, it helps me a lot even if I\\'m french I manage to follow. Even if you are all speedy ^^\\n\\nCould you make a video on the complexation reactions ? Thanks, keep up the good work =D ! \"cool arms law\", damn automatic translator!, you are so funny sometimes (most of the time) \"Augustus is in a relationship with Hazel.\"\\nBrilliant. 3:59 A Doofenshmirtz backstory Hey I\\'m in 8th grade and I\\'ve watched all of these video\\'s and I don\\'t have to do any thing in class my teacher said to go sit in the back and read Thank you for existing, Hank & Co! This helped me study fore a test I have soon! This video made me forget everything I knew... My test is tomorrow He\\'s not fast, he\\'s too fast. It just feel like he has to go to the restroom so badly coolfamish i feel like its not complicated, i think sometimes we think we are \"bad\" at something causing us to not learn something at our own pace but rather hindering our learning, anyone reading this that has issues with something. Cause you feel your bad at it or you havent done it in years, dont misunderstand you are not bad at it and the time is not relevant in learning it matters to learn now amd grow from their, all people forget adapt and change, im a nurse i dont know or remember everything i learnt in school or all to be in nursing but i remind myself i can LEARN that helps amd exposer helps even more SJChip i agree though i seem to grasp the info if its new as i utilize my other related elements and i utilize conceptual understanding aka using unrelated ideas that just happen to be very similiar No, I put the video to 1.5x speed the first time I watched and I still understood him. >I can still understand him at 1.5x speed.\\n\\nThat\\'s because you\\'re not trying to learn the material - you already completely understand the material.\\n\\nThis is, btw, why so many math, science and technical instruction material are so bad - because the people editing, reviewing, checking etc the material do not remember what it\\'s like to try to learn these things for the very first time. I can still understand him at 1.5x speed. How did r squared become just r when calculating for NaCl? I have a exam tomorrow and am screwed over even after watching this “death”is what I feel I do not study for my Chem tests, I watch crash course 😍 O.o I kinda got lost and spaced out while he was talking yet I understand what he is trying to say at the same time. cool video XD XD!\\xa0 Amma beat yo boyfriend up 😂 LOL right.............there are plenty other beautiful girls out there, shouldn\\'t be hard for you to find another......I\\'M TAKEN DUDE :P Cuz you beautiful \\nAnd krazyAss 😂 in need? WHY? you are a stranger O.o I love these so much! They\\'re a great help when studying for exams!!! Thanks, Hank! This helped a lot!!! I am very happy that this was recommended to me by my teacher. I love Crash Course!\\nUpdate: Okay I am SO glad I watched this. I understood nothing from my normal lesson haha 2:24     Marcelline from Adventure Time\\n Honestly enjoyed this video and understood more after i was done watching. I watched this in my chemistry class and i\\'m re watching it for my final. I would recommend taking notes on the video for a quick and easy summary. I put the subtitles on which made it easier, changing the speed to something slower may also help others who think the video is to fast. Watching these at half speed is the funniest thing ever. The relationship I had with my textbook certainly got better after that advice. No kidding Hank why do you wear that same coat in all the videos?\\nJust asking For first 48 secs,I thought I Came On a relationship Advicing Channel.\\n\\nlol. With the many people here to study for an exam tomorrow. Thank you for making this!!!! 7:01 WOWZAMONKEYPOOP Binge watching these videos for tomorrow\\'s recitation fml Can you do a video on hybridization and valence bond theory?\\xa0 0:32 ahhh childhood memories.\\n\\n....\\n\\nWAIT WTF!! I\\'m watching this because of my tournament.. my coach said watch Chemistry videos.. she also said to learn more about 3D DNAs and more.. please suggest some ideas for my competition 8:14 \\n\\nSo ionic compounds aren\\'t crystals bec they have water inside them? Just broke up with my girlfriend so not enjoying all the relationship metaphors... but I have a test tomorrow...what do ya do folks... Hank sounds like Doc Brown\\'s son with the speed he\\'s talking lol. I love it. When I watched that part, I was like \\'WTF? All the bond lengths I know of were in the hundreds of picometers range, not 1.99pm..\\' Thanks for pointing this out. Who is watch that at quarantine times🤓 \"Bert is married to Ernie.\" LOLOL!!! Hey thank-you very much, incredibly interesting. I\\'m just starting to try and learn how to make electric circuits for amplifiers and I stumbled across how they \\'dope\\' silicon for transistors to make it conductive and now I understand much more fully that process. \\nThanks mate and reckon i\\'m gonna check all your videos out, easy to comprehend the way you put things. CHEEERS I did not understand what we where going to have on my Science test and askes my friend and he showen me this. Of course I didn’t react...\\nHaha...\\nGreat.... I wish I\\'ve seen this episode before my last chemistry exam last week 😥 Thank you for all of the videos, they are great! I like how fast you talk, it keeps me focused. Also, you forgot the \"test panic\" bond Thankyou so much for this, I was so afraid I was going to fail my final tomorrow on chemistry and now it\\'s all clear thankyou so much Thank you so much Hank and whole CC team! I finally start to like and respect chemistry which I use to hate in school. Dear Crash Course, can you please put subtitles in your chemistry videos? Or at least, Hank, could you slow down the narration a bit maybe? Either of these changes will be very appreciated Play it at a slower speed Check out Khan Academy...I used them and come here for a concise review. :) It\\'s perfectly fine for me. play this video at 0.75 speed and he finally sounds like a normal human. Committed subscriber!! Every time I watch one of these videos it makes me wish they\\'d been out while I was still struggling through highschool sciences. ',\n",

This song will be iconic in every single generation @vigy That doesn\\'t even have to do with getting my ears checked, they\\'re entirely different melodically. The main riff from this song is much quicker with much more notes being used over eight bars, and The Beatles song is the total opposite. Even the riffs during the chorus aren\\'t the same.\\n\\nPut each song\\'s riffs into a DAW, note by note, and you\\'ll see the difference. @USMCLP you got get yours checked mat😂 different key, different tempo is obviou don\\'t you think? Different melodic progression? The two lines are ditto. @vigy That’s complete bullshit. Different melodic progression, different key, different tempo. It’s not the same at all. You do realise the main hook is the rip off of the Beatles- it\\'s only love, regardless this song is epic🔥 Something to this song feels really unique: I can’t exactly grasp it. Very unique..it carries you along to nostalgic places Likíķ CTRL O elo oeloe oet relie oe proserfina21096 arrrr @Bailey Freya no Ji yttyuhhioopjbbbvbvvvcvvcccxcxzzz NO QUE TE AMO MUCHO MUCHO MUY BUENAoo Just remember the nostalgia of this song back in the day Planet of the apes on crack I just wanna vibe to dancing monkeys and songs from the 2010s We are all coming back to this because of that one animation of our haikyuu boys dancing and vibing 🤭🥰 My mom really liked Coldplay, and enjoyed every song of their, but especially she loved this one, and every time I was asking her \"What are you listening to?\" smiling, knowing that this is her favorite tune, she replied every time \"The monkeys!!!\" with such cheer enthusiasm, that you could still see her laughing after a month of non-stop listening. I can still remember the synthesizer that was keeping her up all night, waking me up half in half an hour until 3 to 8 A.M. every morning. :D She was... 67 - because she never had the pleasure to celebrate her 68th birthday on 4 May 2019... she died in the silent night on 4th January 2019, and yes, I know this is late to say, but with all this quarantine thing, I found the occasion to share this memory of her and my life with you.

Belgium closed all resturants, Cinemas even Clothing shops for months they closed schools all the way in late february and the final tests were given automatically almost everything except food shops and hospitals were closed everybody was forced to wear a mask (AND STILL IS) you must wear a mask while shopping or at school now the schools are reopening only for people above 8 y/olds in march nobody was able to enter the country or leave (except only if they were from another country and had to go back) i myself live in belgium and haven\\'t seen anything about ``partaaayyy``. Animal Nerd Belgium is derived from the latin name Belgica. Originating from the times of the Roman empire. So the idea is ancient, the country however is indeed not. @Animal Nerd it was a part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands\\nKoninkrijk der Nederlanden\\nNow the Benelux Wij Nederlanders voerden lockdowns in in steden als Amsterdam, Utrecht en Leiden But that be Britain tho Wuhan: We have mosquitoes, Cogrogess, Rats and Mice... want a bite? @bruh moment I would rather eat baseball bat😂 Bats and they have dogs Who is here after black death reported again  in china, 2020?\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\n\\nCHINA!🤬 @Drake ????? yes its is China wants to kill the whole world yeah u shouldn\\'t @Shams Haque no its not the black people are seeking revenge Ah yes racism \"People Dying\"\\n\"Children Crying\"\\n\"Parents Trying\"\\nCorona and Bubonic Plague: *hehe the curve go brrrrrrrr* @memes IG You do realise that every country is making vaccines? @memes IG not gonna be finished soon tho @Alfanex stfu kiddo America is making the cure Swine flu: oink oink\\nHantavirus: forget everything FORGET EVERyTHING Alfanex Alfanex more than half of our population absolutely does care, and we’re trying our best to keep ourselves and others safe. But our elected federal leaders and state governors are killing us. They have absolutely no regard for human life, even children. They don’t believe in science either, so they stir up the completely moronic part of our population to be anti-masks, and anti-social distancing. That’s exactly why our hospitals and ICUs are overflowing, our morgues are overflowing so dead people are kept in refrigerators outside, and people are being buried in mass graves. And while this virus ravages our communities, the government is trying to FORCE schools to reopen, leaving our children and teachers terrified, and at severe risk, in just a few weeks. We are fed up with this, and honestly, a revolution is coming. We’re desperate, unemployed, 30% of our citizens who rent their houses or apartments couldn’t afford to pay their July bills, and it’s all just spiraling downhill, fast. \\n😓😓😓😓😓 Can we get an f for Italy because they seem to get hit the most every time F now 5 months later .... F F @Varun 420 hey i see, mortis Wuhan is like the DJ khaled of pandemic.\\n\"Another one\" @Just some guy on youtube bruhhh And ur pfp is the dj khaled of comments.\\n\\'\\'Another one\\'\\' Damn don\\'t you hate when every couple of centuries Wuhan wants to delete the entire human kind? Moral of the story : China is the one responsible for many disastrous pandemic outbreaks throughout human history. @Kane 2703 you dont have to know about germs to know diseases & viruses spread throught human contact. People have always known that, Europeans even thought that Mental illnesses (like schitzophrenia for example) could spread through contact so people with mental illnesses were shunned from society, abandoned or killed. TheBraveGallade good point i mean, 20% of the global population is in china, and historically even more. if you roll the dice, chine is the most common place by default. you\\'re killing it thank you donald j. trump The plague originated from Wuhan and the outbreak started in Italy first, before infecting the whole of Europe? Where have I heard that before? 😒 Random guy sneezes in Wuhan.\\nPeople in Europe: Ah shit here we go again. @Tina Fay they did not prevent the spread @That saiyan guy now it is This comment is so dumb.Sneezing is a symptom.Constant coughing is the result of a disease. Not sure how people watching this video jump to the conclusion that ALL their problems come from China but sorry you\\'re issues are your own. Just like we see now with Covid-19 if you guys did your jobs you wouldn\\'t be in this situation. China beat the Black Death no problem. It beat SARS and Swine Flu no problem. It\\'s beaten Covid no problem. Please don\\'t keep blaming others and let another disease knock out 60% of your population again. Get it together! @Janice Launders If you do a search for it China\\'s had a total of 7 epidemics. The first one was Bubonic plague. How many Europeans died? Millions? 60% of the population? It barely touched China. There\\'s only one mention of it anywhere and it\\'s what\\'s in this video. It probably came from China. The end. The next 3 are also Black Death and they hit during colonialism from 1910 when the Qing Dynasty fell to 1946 as the Chinese Revolution began. (aka probably the worst position China could be in to take on a plague nevermind 3) Even then in total it killed 100,000 and isn\\'t really mentioned in the history. So on the one hand you have millions adding up to 60% of the entire continent\\'s population and on the other you have not even a percent of a percent of the population. 4:57 wait WUHAN? The same city that the coronavirus was first found in?? I see coincidence here Ok so lemme get this staight, corona and th plague both started near wuhan, both dont show symptons for about a week, but were massively spread in italy and both varied a lot from country to country 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 Snow Wang sad time for pangolins 😭 Snow Wang just accept it China is real bad when it comes to plagues and pandemics there is no excuse @videos of random stuff channel We haven\\'t yet discovered its origin, but many people think it originated in a bat, got passed to a panglion, and the panglion transmitted it to humans. except corona came from bats at a live animal market at wuhan “70% of England’s population died out” also highlights Wales, brilliant @Wrathcaster The Principality of Wales was a client state of England from 1216 to 1542. @Dᛞ Uᚢ Wᚹ Aᚨ Nᚾ Gᚷ I think Wales wasn\\'t part of The Kingdom of England in 1347, my history is a little rusty so maybe I am mistaken, shrugs I mean Wales back then was part of the Kingdom of England. People: corona and  2020  Is the Worst!\\nBlack Death: ... The second wave (which took years to come back around in some places) was worse than the first, its amazing humans haven\\'t been wiped out No, that’s it. Take Wuhan, and out it somewhere else. We’re not doing this again. Byzantine Empire: *YESSSS I ALMOST CLAIM ROMAN*\\nBlack Death: *not today!* we’re screwed We should just cancel wuhan at this point I don\\'t think it works like that Ok so lemme get this staight, corona and th plague both started near wuhan, both dont show symptons for about a week, but were massively spread in italy and both varied a lot from country to country 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 “... started near wuhan.”\\n\\nm8 wot ...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*wot* poppy gaming roblox There’s also no evidence that it came from Wuhan. At least I couldn’t find any. @Sean Crawford Bro your TLDR is basically the same length as your story china is getting suspicious Well,  if i remember correctly, all of the pandemics humankind have seen originated from the area we called Wuhan.(except Cholera related pandemics) Earth : we\\'ll soon be overpopulated\\nCorona; you can acquire my services Just shut down the whole f***ing city of wuhan\\n\\n*plague: 0* @nvstewart First of all no one is hating China. People are saying that eating raw meat is wrong which is correct and when they say that it\\'s China\\'s fault , they are talking about the communist party of China and not the people living there and they are right about the communist party of China being narcissistic and ignorant. I don\\'t see how you\\'re comparing to \" every police officer hates black people crowd\". The government of China is clearly wrong morally and Chinese people need to change their habit of eating raw meat @Doctor Jones the mongol horde started the second wave🙃 @nvstewart na mate it started it china, its the wuhan disease @Liam Coyne and you thumbed up your own comment, how sad. ok no one asked I am here after report of black death in China. The \\nWHAT Yeah we have the vaccine and every year there’s about 5 people getting Black Death in USA Wuhan is like DJ Khaled of pandemics, suffering from succes. \"It would be exactly like if a disease wiped out 3.15 billion people today\"\\n\\nThanos: Wouldn\\'t happen that big these days; Corona Virus is an example. If the Corona Virus happened 500 years ago, it would of been as bad, if not worse than, the Plague. Technology is the reason the Virus has been kept at a minimum, and hasn\\'t killed millions. Someone half of europe.... Half...... just saying..... Bats: china wasnt done with spreading corona nope one person just been reported to have Bubonic Plague which caused the black death pandemic the person infected was in China\\'s Inner Mongolia province China 🇨🇳 Hold bk corona.   “Black Death Just Enter the Chat”..... so like China has this plague atm.  147 people are quarantined.

It even was a sub-kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire, together with the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Kingdom of Germany. Dude Corona virus is a pandemic not a plague @fiki- playing and having fun Italy wasn\\'t really a \\'country\\' back then, and was barely even defined as a singular region anymore. the south was pretty much owned by the Kingdom of Aragon (One half of what would become Spain), the center was under the direct dominion of the Pope (called \\'The Papal States\\'), and in the North it was mostly Merchant City-States that were part of the Holy Roman Empire, like Genoa and Milan the difference is this is a weak virus DONT BE COCKY KIDS!!😂😂😂 I\\'m beginning to see a pattern here that I\\'m not so sure if I like God: Hmmmm Lets make Norway sleep for 500 Years due to a disease.

The big 3 of Europe . Eating rats and bats since the garden of Eden. As if USA aren\\'t hit the most. And don’t forget England......and east Europe is barely affected. Strange So anyway I started blasting I was literally listening to that video for sleeping when I heard Wuhan and instantly went to the comments. Doesn\\'t it seem strange that China always has the weirdest diseases? 7:50 \\nlmao why turaida is in this video\\nactually living close to this castle xddd Me: oh no black death😰😨      Also me when reallifelore said humanity has learned to fight against it :kalm Native Americans were just chilling while everyone in EurAsia were dying @Sniper Viper   Africans chilling?   Definitely not in north Africa.  North Africa was was very much part of the area affected by the Black Death, as shown on the map at 7:02.     \\n\\nAnd there are claims the Black Death reached and devasted sub-Saharan Africa as well.  Gerard Chouin, a historian at William and Mary, has compiled circumstantial evidence the Black Death spread to lower Africa and killed massive numbers of people there, as it did in Eurasia and north Africa.  This would make sense; Eurasia had trade routes at the time with sub-Saharan Africa. XxFlxffyHeartsxX - The land is still there... it\\'s just the name that\\'s different. Maybe their tribe wasn\\'t even a thing back in 1347 and Inuits(or Eskimo. whatever u want to call them) Which meant they had no immunity to any of these diseases and that ultimately killed more native americans than all the guns could Bubonic plague exizzt.\\nThanos: you have my respect. Humanity has finally learned how to fight back against the bubonic plague\\nAmerica: Are you sure about that? Yes, it did, wtf are u trying to say. COVID-19 and the bubonic plague are different things, and he was talking about the treatment for it, and America doesn\\'t have treatment for COVID-19. Why is everybody talking about \\n“covid-19” because Wuhan China is where The Black Death started and Covid-19 What about the pneumonic plague outbreak in Manchuria where almost everyone who got the disease died?

I\\'ve search all over the internet and didn\\'t even find one. This is a really horrible way of telling information to people. Please do more research on this subject, this kind of thing can mislead people into hatred and stuff. I know that Coronavirus started in Wuhan and it\\'s really hard for many people to deal with this virus as it\\'s affecting a lot of people economically, mentally, etc. However, it doesn\\'t mean you can spice things up and recreate history because you don\\'t like the things that are going on now or you just hate Wuhan or Chinese people. exactly, i noticed the same thing and it really didn’t sit right with me Bacteria,viruses: Sees Wuhan \\nAlso them: So anyway I started infecting 4:45\\n\\nWuhan in 2020:\\n\\n\\n*You could not live with your own failures, and where did that bring you? Back to me...* Wuhan: just being a city\\n\\n\\nViruses: eh it\\'s good enough it has come back now\\nNot COVID-19\\nBUT THE ACTUAL BUBONIC PLAGUE \\nIN NORTHERN CHINA @Wrathcaster If Hulk Mode black death came back we\\'d have more chances of stopping the over population, idiots would die fast \"cause it\\'s fake\" lol. @Wrathcaster the deadly mutated form would be a nightmare it never left, each year there is quite a few cases confirmed, the only reason this case in mongolia is making waves is because everyone is already on edge with covid, the black death as of now is currently not a threat due to antibiotics.......at least until the black death decides to go into hulk mode and mutates into another unstoppable form :P Yeah, I heard about it. In Mongolia too. Wuhan: *exists* \\nDiseases: It’s free real estate. Just propaganda video, a city called Wuhan didn\\'t even exist back then RACIST!!! Let\\'s see how much of wuhan is left when I\\'m done. Nuke it. Dlrss1v2 Fuck is that ? Coronavirus: Prepare for trouble!\\nG4 virus: Make that a double!\\nBubonic plague: Make that a triple!\\n2021: *𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐜* @Euan Garces I cant wait to see in 2021 that henta virus Henta virus : make it a quadruple ',\n",

I don\\'t subscribe the religion but if religious person can make you resort to shit like that in the face of their arguments.....then it says more about you than it does them.\\n\\nEdit: \"Scoff\" you are acting like a child. this is why I say that strict atheists and religious extremists are two sides to the same coin.

Aparently yes \"The female spits in disapproval\", sounds about right @Madiha Shaikh All hail email! @Madiha Shaikh what a dumb comment, rape is the most common thing in the animal kingdom, don\\'t compare us to them, there\\'s animals that evolved certain things in their penises just so they could rape more easily and on the contrary, the species would go extinct (in this case). @Madiha Shaikh yeah, much respect to the email 📧 @Nawal STAMP Even in the animal kingdom the opinion of the email is respected.

I really love getting positive feedback like this, because as you can see from other comments, I get a lot of negative feedback, sometimes quite rude.  My respect to you. @Random Guy Nothing can support evolutionary theory. @hmu05366 Open minded? How was any of your previous comments open minded? Do you pride yourself of being a hypocrite? Do you even hear yourself nigga? You completely dismissed everything he had to say purely on the basis that he believes in something you do not, disregarding whether or not there\\'s any truth to his actual argument. You are a complete ass. He\\'s a trump supporter, but I won\\'t dismiss what he has to say just because, you need to grow up. @Buck Buchanan I\\'m not big on religion, in more of an agnostic but you have my praises for the simple fact that you argue your point civilly, provide sources etc unlike these edgy atheists who just disregard and dismiss because they don\\'t agree, with no attempt to disprove. Ironically while, considering themselves as arbiters of truth and an authority on logic when they use non and just believe what they\\'re told because putting all your eggs in the science basket without question is supposedly a sign of intelligence. @Darkjanggo TDI You don\\'t either. 8:26 *\"The battles are so brutal, the makes must train for years.\"*\\n\\n\\nLooks more like an akward hug.

So at 59 years old no soul mate, no real relationship, suffer from  trust issues, and I pray to my Lord to take away those thoughts of feelings of unloved. Then I stumbled across your message.

Living, breathing beings that happen to be born on this little blue marble. We have no choice on what country we are born, to what family or race, what socioeconomic we are raised in. There is a unique gift that everyone has and is capable of...I see it in the comments...no matter the miles in between...I hope that you create a life worth living, that we always have a chance to do better than the day before and practice forgiveness with yourself and with others. The experiences we have had in life shape what we believe about the world and about others...moving beyond our experiences into the belief in others and their unique gifting and capacity to love in spite of our many differences and learning to embrace our commonalities...I hope for humanity, that love will one day be stronger than the wall of differences we build...

I watch some of the games with him over the phone for a little bit.  Cherish precious memories.   God bless.  Sorry about your dad. My heart aches for you...I am so sorry for your loss.\\nMy husband died in June after many years of suffering. \\nI miss my best friend, yet rejoice that he is in the loving hands of our Lord..we will reunite.

It was hell for her.  For three years she suffered.  Then she passed quietly one night.  I didn\\'t grief.  She was finally free.  About a month later she came to me in a dream.  She was happy.  She was walking, running in fact She was so happy and free i was was so happy for her happiness and freedom.  She is happy.  I miss her even though it\\'s been 10 years but she is having new experiences and meeting new friends.  She has a wonderful life now I am sorry for your loss For the person who can\\'t sleep and still looking for love. After 1000 dates, a divorce with 2 very young kids, I finally found my twin who I love more than I would have imagined. I am in my late 40s and she is my true first love.\\nIf I can find true love with ally my challenges, so can you God Loves you so much, HE CAN HELP YOU, just call out to Jesus! HE BROUGHT ME THROUGH SO MANY TIMES! 🙏✝️ Live a life of love. @Jackie Dupree There is no \"god\", hence I can be Egoistique and always put M¥selves first :p Keep God first in your lives. @Chakra Bunny yest like a Poop sausage in Toilette ??? :P WAIT, DONT SCROLL PAST, you should stop scrolling, and sleep. Lol nah dog Right i should.. Yep true goodnight <3 You are not my dad!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDaddy?! Hey everyone, whatever you\\'re going through everything will be okay. Don\\'t lose hope. Believe in yourself, love yourself ❤️ I am in fear of coyotes at night time 😘 Hi Enough of this bullishit 😨😰😥 @JordanPlayzGames \\nHeathen... I don\\'t feel alone right now. Reading all these comments, I feel like we\\'ve all felt this feeling at some point in our lives and some of us never let it go. It\\'s ok to be weird and odd, it\\'s ok to think about things that you shouldn\\'t think about because they supposedly \"don\\'t matter.\" What better way to want to be better than to believe that you are more than what purpose you serve now. It makes me happy too see such kindness from humanity here in the comments, i see that we look out for eachother regardless of who and what we are. Because we are humans no matter what we are the same. I also see that we put stereotypes aside and accept everyone and that is the world I know deep down inside.\\nAnd for the person who scrolls down here to find hope, happiness and love this is for you \\nThere are times when..we are down and defeated. It seems like nothing is going to get better and all the regret, sorrow, pain, guilt and sadness is only going to build up and up. It seems as if this is because of you and that its your fault, well..maybe it was or maybe it wasn\\'t I cant tell. And all of that makes you feel worthless and expendable. But I can tell you this, you can\\'t fight every battle alone. You see, there are people called friends..friends help you every step of the way because they love you, care about you, look out for you, worry about you and onr I find the best..laugh with you, i know for some this friend..sounds like a myth but I know that it isn\\'t and that it is indeed true. There are people of different backgrounds and race who care and love people for who they really are! And if you can\\'t get a friend, well..may i..be your first?\\nI may not be there but I will watch over you like a angel and wish you the best of luck in what you do, and when you are down i will try my best to comfort you even if it just brings a drop of happiness.

Great insights, certainly an interesting time in the world economy at the moment. Hi Brandon. Thank you for the fantastic\\nvideo. Can you also talk about taxes for Aussie stock investors ? Thank you. Taxes are considered earnings and must be declared if you are earning over the combined  taxable income threshold no ones exempt , pay your taxes unless you would like a letter usually by tax department , it is a kind letter please pay A amount to the B arseholes ! If you ignore that and continue to tax dodge well they will chuck you in the big house Aussie Wealth Creation tax video is something I’d like to see too. Doesn’t really get discussed much.

You’re better than 3/4 of uni lecturers! Thank you! Mate your fantastic! Keep up the top work. Thanks Naveen! Another quality vid mate. Would love to hear your thoughts on  diversifying in ETF\\'s for the long term. Yeah you can definitely diversify across lots of ETFs but remember eventually you\\'ll have so many stocks that you\\'re literally just getting a market return. So you could simplify into one ETF that tracks the market and be done... Best video I\\'ve found on this topic, thank you for the information, really well presented 1K thumbs up 👍 - well done!!! The stock market can be very risky tricky but if managed properly can be very profitable @Cory Dalton so interesting to know you also trade with Mrs Michelle Philips she\\'s really the best @Cory Dalton thanks for this nice info @gail Edgar you can reach out to Mrs Michelle Philips with <<<michellephilips38 (a) g m a I l , com>> for trading assistance I\\'m new to stock trading how do I get started How can I contact Mrs Michelle for trading assistance I have lost so much trading the stock market Hey mate, new subscriber of your chanel.. Loving your content! Quick question, I have an interest earning (1.5% p.a) saving account set up for my daughter, balance so far around $5k.. Would I be better off investing this $5k in a LIC like AFIC or ARGO with DRP and leaving it there for at least 20+ years? Is that enough time to take advantage of compound interest... more so than just leaving it in a bank account? Cheers and keep up the great work! Stock is profitable with the right strategy like that of mike harry trading Made a lot with him last week after investing with him at (mikeharry094@gmail.com) My last week profit with mike harry trading was $5,200 .. he’s a trusted man I work with his strategy, his strategy cut losses and ensures profits I made much profits from APPL stocks. @Jackson Rodriguez Ok, you can go write him at <<officialderrickpayne@gmail.com>> Having a very good investment plan that ensures steady incomes without any doubts prepares you for a well organized future, even in retirement. I made almost half a million this year investing with Derrick. @William Daniels  i would like to know more about his services I have come to realize that making profits in stock trading is when you invest with a broker who has vast knowledge and working strategy that yields huge profits..i have great respect for Sir Derrick. @Jackson Rodriguez When you make the right decisions and take the right steps in trading the chances of losing your funds becomes slimmer and almost impossible especially when you have the right broker helping you trade, Mr Derrick does mine.

I can’t find a link for your course. Could you please direct me. Thanks Thanks Tobias! nice video Brandon, can you do a vid on online brokerage account share analyses? just the simple stuff. \\nThe big question though, if it\\'s not magic, what is it? Hey,\\nLooking for advise on the best online broker for scalping.. The school wants me to watch this Personally after I traded for myself and lost all my money,Adrielhemingway has been handling my trade ever since and I wouldn’t recommend beginners to start trading for themselves right away. @Evelyn Humberman that\\'s so good I won’t lie,my first investment was pretty low,my payout wasn’t that great either but my next investment was pretty okay and my payout was huge. Having your investments handled by an expert trader will definitely put your mind at ease. You need the right amount to get started and your minimum investment should be just enough to get Adrielhemingway to trade properly for you. All I wanted to do was learn how to trade and become a good trader and I got detailed and explanatory tutorials from Ms Adriel and now I’m getting better. I\\'m trying to figure out which platform to use ... Been looking at coinspot and had a look at plus500 but that had a lot of people saying no good. My goal is to earn, what I earn each week at work $800 per week :) I invest In forex with the help of expert trader Mr Dwight with his unique trading strategy I\\'ve been able to make  weekly profits with my investments and I also been able to save up $37k in less than 3 months @Bennett Giggs more details? I\\'m using IG group atm and stake. But not using real $$$ just yet. I\\'m doing paper money until I understand it all :) With an investment 0f $500 on forex trading you will get a profit 0f about $2,500 weekly, with the help of a mentor or expert. I get profits payments weekly. Except you didn\\'t address the most important point, how do I get the charts!?!?!??!?!? Yes, commsec has a chart but it\\'s VERY limited, it doesn\\'t even give you candlesticks. The most important part of trading is being able to figure out what stocks to actually trade! I\\'ve watched like 10 videos now and NONE of them mention where to get decent charts, why??? thx, man! Great video, I’m also watching you stock market jargon explained ones at the moment which are super helpful. Wondering if you have any videos on self managed super funds? I know I’m too young to be looking at that yet lol but I’m interested to hear your thoughts on them. I get paid every fortnight. After paying board and phone bill I have $400 that goes to uber eats 😂😂😂 now I want to invest because I don\\'t want to work my whole life. None of want to work our whole lives! That’s a big reason to invest and start early! Thanks so much! I love how you showed it all using CommSec!! :) Made me feel much more comfortable. So helpful! Thank youuu! Heyyy I was looking for this exact video. Gonna be good to watch. Interesting to see another carnivore here! Cheers Trav. Glad I can help :) What if I want to invest in bonds?

Hi Jazz, if you are truly serious about looking at trading in stocks and are serious about learning from an industry expert, feel free to message me and I\\'ll be able to tell you how Great Video and easy to follow! Thanks! This is the video I have been looking for Thanks for watching Dain! Share it around :D Great job mate! if you invested 5k in tesltra when this video was released youd have made 700 dollars Alexander Karacsony Tesla has been 40 percent per annum for me @Jack Mc i reckon 11.5 percent return is alot 😬😬 big investment not much return. Try tesla the stock market is evidently the biggest market in the world, perhaps that\\'s why every economic breakdown affects its market trend. Coming from one who has been a keen follower of the stock market, the stock market trade is very lucrative but along the line you would see the world is getting set for a major digital revolution. Our local and international currencies are being taken over by digital currencies and its a fast taken route. 1 bitcoin is worth over $9000 and its still on the raise. i tried bitcoin for the first time when i came across a video of it online and since then i was fascinated by it, and i met Allen Albert who taught me how bitcoin can be managed, traded to maximize profit, on my first week i made  $40,700 from an initial trading capital of $10,000. I would recommend Albert to anyone willing to try out bitcoin and how beneficial it can be, he can be reached  on tellygram (albertrade) or Whatsapp *(+44 738 035 6836) for guidance. . Let\\'s move together, these are good times Bitcoin over dollar anyday, I use Albert services a couple of times till I got to analyse the the market for myself With time I think, more people would be more receptive to the use of crypto currencies Digital currencies sounded crazy back then, who would have believed I would be here watching videos on them and having some for myself If only some people would be patient to understand that Bitcoin isn\\'t going anywhere, instead it\\'s taking over the globe. Crypto to the moon, started using Albert signals for just a duration of 3 months on my live account and its amazing I must say, have been looking for an avenue to tell others about it Hi Brandon. Would you recommend any trading platform for trading on ASX  by any chance, where I can do technical analysis AU shares?Cheers Hey Rom Kov ... If you need  help trading, feel free to reach me via mail... (technicaltradings221@gmail.com) Hi Brandon, just wondering if I can use my super to buy shares.. cheers Michael Wilson thanks for your reply Michael.. really appreciated Emerson Pereira I’m not Brandon however you can ask your super company to have a self managed fund where you pick the shares/stocks all super is are managers buying shares for you , so if you have superannuation that’s all it is so you already have shares Amazing video mate! Thanks Hugo! Spent the last 2 years learning and trading stocks but took a recent interest in bitcoin due to its ease and profitability. Bitcoin latest uptrend shows the bulls are still very strong and ready to run and getting one bitcoin will be out of the purchasing power of many due to the upcoming bull run so now makes it the best time to buy, accumulate and increase your portfolio. An approach to trading which I have taken over the years and has always been productive for me is trading under the guidance of a well-seasoned expert trader and Sebastian Wigman stands out among the lot. With his trade signals, I have grown my portfolio from 1 btc to 6 btc in just one month. His trade signals are accurate, effective and gives you consistent winnings in your trade. Sebastian can be reached through WhatsApp: *+31 97005034459* or Telegram *(@wigmans),* I urge more investors to tap into the great potentials bitcoin trading holds I mean it gets no better learning and earning at the same time @EJAY I can\\'t wait to see what happens when all the Bitcoins are mined and then the whole system stops.. Hmm sounds very similar to the why Countries continue to expand the money supply making Fiat currency worthless. Why do I feel like everyone here is the same person trying to sell me a service I hope more experts will be willing to open up their trades for less experience traders to benefit. Sebastian is a blessing to me and i am happy i met him The trade Guru. Sabastian is the best at TA The only drawback to earning nicely with Sebastian\\'s help is if you do not have the time to follow up with him. I always turn to him for advise and have been doing well this way Best stockscreener in australia? TradingView, free and very informative Unbelievable video, thanks is tesla good for long pr investing minimum 10 yr Hi man, is the \"mutual funds\" the same as \"Managed funds\"? Hi Brandon .. any thoughts on SAS .. what\\'s  coming. I don\\'t think I have the brain capacity for this it\\'s all so confusing to me Passive investing - the way to go! can you guide about investment product currently in australia with high return without any risk for 3-5 years term or any return with absolutely no risk. robin singh contact a licensed financial adviser for guidance ^^^^frederickhaugen@gmail.com How did you bring up the page which shows Telstra Currently Trading Price? Very informative,  thank you 😊 Tell me, how do people claim 10% return from the market on average when they have to pay tax every year on dividends? One can only compound interest after tax every year... One must also take inflation into account. @Link Knight But on th ATO website it says \"...However, the company may give you the option of reinvesting your dividends in the form of new shares in the company – this is called a dividend reinvestment scheme. If you take this option, you must pay tax on your reinvested dividends. The amount of the dividend received will form part of the cost base of the shares you receive.\"\\ndoes this contradict that?\\n\\nhttps://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Shares---helping-you-to-avoid-common-mistakes/#H1 Bob Smith government knows how to spend your money do they ha ha ha don’t be so naive bob @Bob Smith he\\'s talked about this and instead of giving you actual dividends there\\'s an option where they just give you actual shares, NOT your broker reinvesting the dividends when they are paid out. I\\'m ok with taxes as long as they are used to fund the right things like roads, healthcare, education, firefighters, smart businesses, etc. What i\\'m suspicious about is these claims of \"wow, the power of compounding is amazing!! let me show you how it works! ...\" then they omit taxes which significantly diminishes return. Having $1M in the bank after tax is quite different than having $1M worth of stocks that if you sell you have to pay a huge chunk in taxes. Then it\\'s also different than pretending that the market on average will double your investment every 10 years (in the long run) but they omit to factor taxes and don\\'t tell you that instead it doubles every 15-20 years on average once you factor taxes, quite an important difference given that we don\\'t live forever. Hi mate, how do those who reside outside of Australia trade on ComSec? Especially when it comes to transferring funds overseas to ComSec to be able to trade. Hi Brandon, recently turned 18 and have been keen to get into investing ASAP! I\\'ve got about $500 that I want to start with and have opened an Westpac Online Investing account that has brokerage fee of $19.95. Since I\\'m starting with such a low amount of funds, just wondering what type of stocks I should be looking at and whether sticking with Westpac or going with something like Self Wealth is a more ideal option? Really have enjoyed the few videos I\\'ve seen of yours so far, so keep it up! Yeah you can definitely look to other sites like self wealth to lower your brokerage. My opinion is that it\\'s helpful to look at wide diversified stocks when you\\'re starting out, but of course that\\'s up to you. The sideways movement of bitcoin price is totally normal and shouldn’t dissuade you because bitcoin is getting ready for a huge bounce back so what should be the trend now is accumulating as much bitcoin as you can.  irrespective of any market trend encountered as an investor profit should be made and that’s why am currently accumulating and increasing my portfolio daily through trading with signals provided by Caleb Easterby and I have grown my portfolio to 13 btc from its initial 3 btc in just 2 months. Caleb’s signals and strategies are the best I have used; his signals are accurate, efficient and gives you a consistent profit margin. He can be reached through WhatsApp (+31 635250332) or Telegram (@Easterby).  Now is the time to accumulate and increase your portfolio while waiting for the imminent bull run. @apatheticAnxiety Oh yes, Caleb has helped me tremendously! I don\\'t know how I could live without him! My god, Caleb is just the best, isn\\'t he? I would kiss that man, no homo. @ASomewhatLongAndMeaninglessUserame hey, a human!  How has caleb helped you be a throwaway testimonial? Lol this is the fakest shit I\\'ve seen in a while. I remember my shit and how I was in debt but that’s over now because am living in my own house with a good standard of living for me and my family thanks to Caleb and his awesome signals. His chart analysis is the best Brilliant stuff. Trading stocks is what I invest in and this is how I made my first million dollar. Thanks to Kyle Steve Wall an expert investment manager who handles my trades, we met at a trading summit in NY and he accepted to trade for me. He is the best!. @Matt Elvis Oh he is very remarkable, I found his website. Didn’t know he is this popular. @g8888 Kyle Steven Wall is well known in the US , i do not know your location but i suggest you look him up online or something. I know investing  in stock trading is a great way to grow my money and make good returns but I lack mentors who are really smart, any idea on how to get to Kyle Steven Wall ? Hi Brandon would $1000 - $1500 be suitable for a long term investment or could you tell me what is the minimum amount people should invest for long term?? ',\n",

Something I\\'ve always struggled with is \"finding the places where your customers hang out\". This is quite easy when your audience is marketers. But there are a lot of niches where it\\'s not so straight forward. Especially in B2B. DO you have any tips for that? As most marketers stress the importance of getting into your customers head.\\nBeing able to think of who they are and what they do can lead to some realization about your question.\\nIt\\'s easier to start with the basics.. Age, Gender, and etc.\\nAlso, as for you niche think of the importance or need of your product or service... what and HOW are they looking for it?\\nHope this helps!

Looking at this for the second time and really appreciate your depth, Brian!\\n\\nFYI for viewers regarding the KW volume tools you mention.

I use this free tool instead with good results: https://serps.com/tools/keyword-research/\\n\\nHope it helps people work around GKWP\\'s shortcomings :) Great that you mention the Persona-first approach.

Clear, Concise, and Creative. finally, a keyword research tutorial I understand as beginner, Thank you, Love! Why did you not mention ranking difficulty? If you have two key phrases, both with x searches a month, both with same recommended ad spend and... one has a difficulty of 40 and the other with a difficulty of say 25.

I am glad that I watched this video because I was doing keyword research the wrong way. I will definitely use your helpful blueprint for my business. Thanks a lot!!!! Great video! I have a quick question for everybody Im currently using Wordpress and I cant seem to figure out how many keywords to use and where exactly to put them so if you download a plug in that lets you edit your title tag and meta description you can also add keywords which I get but you can also add keywords on your blog not necessarily in the content but there is a column on the right hand side that allows you to add keywords then you either space them with the Enter key or a coma so I guess my question is do I add my keywords into both locations and as many as I want or just a select few? Thank you!!! This is exactly what I was looking for.  I\\'m going to try out all of these strategies and hopefully I can get my pageviews  up :) Nice! Hey brotha I love your channels and have learned so much from your content! I know an chrome extension that can help you analyze your videos and optimize them to get more views and rank higher in YouTube\\'s search engine.

I use all of the techniques mentioned by you. But, I haven\\'t tried Google trends in keyword mapping. From next time onwards I am definitely going to use trends. Keep sharing more, thanks.

       " 'Your contribution to the student community is fantastic.\\r\\nI have been following your channel for a while and found it useful.\\n\\nI being a Physics teacher hope to get better with my videos. This one will be useful. Especially your audio set-up..!! Jeff Thomas that\\'s great love from India...BTW it\\'s 12:48 am 😅 I love indians Mr. Woo your passion for helping others  is admirable :) How much did he pay you to say that? sub to jeff the diss rapper Lesson to learn :\\nMore the mistakes , more you learn.\\nBut just make sure that you are not repeating same mistake again n again. @Hemang Chauhan Failing Forward. Check it out. I wish I could do the last thing Make this a playlist. Like so he can see then pin this comment https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5KkMZvBpo5CNZwuUjCA-uwtlyOspuIRw You are an incredible mind Mr. Woo, thank you so much for contributing to the education of so so many! You make math easier and beautiful. Even if I in medical school, my interest in math since high school leads me to your videos. Keep up the good work, Eddie. I admire your work, you are an idol. My greek teachers can not even open their laptops webcam🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷 @LEGITYT τι λέει; Καλησπέρα μάν Audio is so often overlooked, I totally agree with everything you said. Sawubona, Eddie Woo\\nI see you, and you are *so much more* than \"a mathematics teacher\" - a Jedi insisting on Permission to Smile, I\\'d say.\\n   ; D Yes so much more. A narcissistic man who thinks he\\'s better than most teachers I forwarded this to my professors since we start doing online class, they need to learn from you Wow, you actually use a Lumix GH5! That\\'s pretty high end for the prosumer market. Usually used by indie cinematographers. Overkill for a classroom presentation. But hey, if you can afford it, why not? :) please, talk about the whiteboard tablet you use. Thank you for being my tutor! As someone who failed math in high school and has now returned to college, I can\\'t say I\\'d have gotten through my calculus track without your videos! Keep up the work! \\nCheers! I\\'ve been following and watching your video for years. This somewhat simple video about equipment  setup makes me feel that you can teach almost anything! Your teaching style is so clear, simple, energetic and yet very welcoming. You can teach us how to cooking, plumbing, root canal treatment, how to be a batman, etc. and we\\'ll enjoy it mightily! Keeping up the great work Eddie! Thanks Eddie. Because of your work, I did my master degree two years ago on a thesis studying this way of learning. The take-away is that while the quality of the audio, video would matter, ultimate the quality of teaching is the most important. Some great ideas thank Eddie! I\\'m starting to record more in-class videos, and the need to get the audio right cannot be stated strongly enough! Omg I thought he was holding a gun at first glance 😂 Eddie, a massive thanks for sharing your passion and wisdom. Just shared this with my staff. I love your strategy,Teacher. I\\'ll apply what you\\'ve share to everyone of us I\\'m a Teacher too here in the Philippines. Godbless! As a teacher, I thank you very much for sharing this information. I do wonder how much time is spent on editing. Anyways, thanks for your recommendations on the microphones.\\n\\nCurrently, I\\'m discovering whiteboard apps to provide my students with demonstration videos. Do you have any software suggestions? (currently using explain everything but I\\'m open for suggestions) Cheers Eddie, surprisingly similar kit to me! I never knew that I could use the mics I use in the DSLR on my phone, good to know! Great advice! I thought about doing videos just to boost my own learning curve. This was giving me much needed perspective. Thanks! 😃 Dearest Mr. Woo, I am a retired Canadian Grandmother who has a great deal of respect for our teachers all over the globe.  I want you to know that you are such a wonderful young man whom I know contributes so much education not only to our younger generation but also to many others, like me.  Never underestimate the power of education, and never underestimate the many whom you reach.  Deepest thanks, Mr. Woo! You make me totally fall in love with maths. Tbh, you are such an outstanding teacher ever!!! Really interested coz I can use it to my teachings. that\\'s The Kim Kardashian of Math Teaching for you lads :D\\nGreat work Eddie man, you\\'re a massive inspiration You are an inspiration and have inspired many around the world, including myself, to help students with mathematics. Respect to you, a true legend. I\\'m thinking about translating at least a few videos. Much more people should get to know you Mr. Woo. Thank you and keep up the good work. Dobra Such an inspiration you are! Upper secondary teacher from Sweden. This is infor that I need to know I watch your highschool lesson to help me on my college understanding. Thanks Eddie. Thanks for classes but it\\'s camra and equipment very expensive. When i earn from YouTube i promise i bought it 😍 This is very helpful to all students learning at home at this pandemic time..keep safe everyone #stayhome #withme Fantastic tutorial and so easy to understand. Thank you. Good sound is most important. 👍 Thank you for the tips my friends ..more videos and this is very helpful. Professor!! I have been waiting for you so long!! What I Know About You;\\nUr A Maths Teacher\\nUr From Teenage Boss Damn, the quality of the videography in this video is superb. It looks like and advertising. lol Thank you your teaching about equipment,editing and ubload Thank you your teaching about equipment,editing and ubload Mr. Woo, I\\'m a university student in Engineering and your videos explain concepts so well that I\\'ve struggled with since secondary school! Keep up the fantastic work.\\n\\nOut of curiousity, what AV setup did you use to record this video? how did u get into uni... Thank you for sharing your knowledge ❤️❤️🙏 Excellent resource! Thanks for sharing this. You’re legendary mate Wish my uni professor had such passion for helping students , they are not even providing us syllabus for exams , let alone videos Sad mate it\\'s just so sad. What about drawing tablet and generally equipment for math tutorials? Thx a lot To hold your phone, go to the chemistry department and get the stand they use for holding a beaker while using a Bunsen burner. They even have clamps and they always have extra. Great video sir Eddie, get yourself some short sleeved shirts Thank you Eddie. Could you please make a video about which editing software you use. Thanks When math teacher does tech support!!! I admire this mans willingness to open education up online, and his enthusiasm to assist teachers create content. \\n\\nThe issue: the majority of the curriculum is already online in numerous examples. So I don’t see why teachers should all start making videos for online lessons if they can point the student to the right video anyway. This is discussed by student teachers and lecturers in contemporary Australia. Teachers are now more of a node amongst many nodes, and part of their job is to guide students down the digital path, not to always create a digital example. If some teachers feel an intense need or compulsion to share their originality or connect their students with their individual personality, then by all means they should make content. But this should not be mandatory as essentially the time could be better used on working with students individually or connecting more original thoughts, than creating content on subject specific concepts that are already available.\\n\\nFor example, calculating an angle in geometry has not changed. There is no need for a teacher to spend 3 hours making it, editing, changing mistakes, fixing technical complications and possibly reshooting, if Mr woo already has a video showing how to calculate the angles of a triangle. If the information is correct and appropriate, point the student to the video. I\\'m new bro. Thank you for keeping this video nice Thank you for teaching us. And share your experiment. Hello my dear teacher... What type of books u prefer fo mathematics Eddie Woo, you are the man! I\\'m not confused about how you did it from a technological point of view. I\\'m confused about how you did it from a time management point of view. I seem to spend all of my time on admin, paperwork and reporting :( Really useful for teachers who are beginning to create online content...like me :) Data science YouTube educator here. Nice advice and tech. Love the math vids and teaching style! Woow thank you for keeping this video dear Wow fantastic 😊 but hope 1 person  give it tome a microphone 😞 Very useful tips Eddie! Love your videos and your explanations! oooooo eddie flexing with the iphone 11 Thanks for the video really helpful for new youtubers like me. Hello! good information, thanks. Eddie woo should make a live video and have people in the chat be able to answer the questions,\\n hence making him teach the youtube viewers 1 on 1. Poggers I loveeeeeeeee Eddie Woo Amazing! It\\'s May and I don\\'t know why it took this long for me to watch this. This actually popped up on my creator monthly email. Anyway, I look forward to the rest of the series. Thanks! No worries Vince! I’ve already made the other videos: https://youtu.be/fqOYpinjCkk and https://youtu.be/gcU3T4EgzyY Really useful, thanks. Good man.  You’re a star.  Keep it up Amazing sir... I love it How many cameras did you use for this video in order to achieve those  jump shots? Thanks - very helpful. Good jod tanks🙏 Great information.  Note...if you use your phone to record and use the FRONT CAMERA (enabling you to see your image), your video may be a MIRROR IMAGE of your shot.  Things written on the board will not come out correctly.  Make sure to use the BACK CAMERA. What is the tripod with the red leg? Teaching with YouTube..Thanks for sharing video. Great contribution its help us alot. Your teaching are excellent..🙏🏻🙏🏻😊😊 What do you use to edit the videos Mr Woo? Thank you  verry much for this informashn Sir I have a problem with matrix why division is not possible in matrices \\n???? Piyush Pardeshi is possible but with inverse haha love it!! yeee can I get a heart because I don\\'t have one Thanks Mr. Woo! Amazing Amazing Mr. Woo No entiendo el inglés pero se ve interesante 🤷 Wow good contribution to your student lots of learning I’m curious, if you are showing the camera you use, what was used to film this video? Probably another camera that he used throughout the years This is it. legend Woohoo! Thank You Like sip mantap!!!!👌👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩 The biggest mystery in math is, to me, why some people call it \"maths\", instead of just \"math\"?\\n In the US in every place I ever went to school from kindergarten to university, I never heard anyone say \"maths\".\\n Just math.\\n When did there get to be many maths?\\n How many are there?\\n What was wrong with it when we just had the one? En español por favor. Just a comment on the price classes we are dealing with:\\nSimple setup: around 100 $  or 200 $ depending on which mic you use\\n\"Heavy duty\" setup: around 2000 - 3000 $, as in addition to your roughly 1-2k camera you want plenty of sd cards, which en masse become expensive, as well as a fairly expensive lavellier wireless mic. \\n\\nThere are intermediate options but as eddie said, as long as you heave a great mic, the phone will deliver adequate video nowadays, especially if properly stabilized, so unless you want to go all in i\\'d stick with that. @Hushed Tones Well you only record high pixel because it downscales more beautifully.\\nI do not consider the phone to have a price because almost everyone has one that can make decent video nowadays. if you LITERALLY do not need a phone then ok i guess its cheaper to get a 500 $ camera that can accept an optic but i consider that the vast outlier. phones setup are expensive too its just that everyone already has a phone (lot of them worth around $1k).\\n\\nSD cards have become cheap compared to 5 years ago. \\n\\nIf its an issue just record 1080p. HD on most pro-sumer cameras is better than 4K on most phones. Number of pixel doesn’t matter if you record with a very compressed codec into tiny files. :) So inspiring ',\n",
       " 'This is so fake. Tom tested positive for Adrenochrome. Currently in jail awaiting a squealing interview. Why does his neck go THROUGH his shirt... that’s what I want to know... @Bubbs pelch What theres no articles saying anything hes not what you say he is you just want to cancel random people because you have no life You\\'ll never see Hanks in public again. Bet on it. @FreeTime Player it\\'s a deep fake. Look closely at his hands and neck. Not the hands and neck of a 64 year old man. Plus the green screen behind him. Get your eyes checked. Green screen TOM HANKS your the new BILL COSBY ........you and every one related to Jeffry Epstein are going down 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 Lol what evidence do u have of that 🍕🍕🍕 Weinstein ratted everyone out after quarantine people you wont even expect people we all looked up to will be in jail @Avi Iva  tom hanks was involved that one The only joke is watching celebrities trying to act normal 💯 Wait so you think celebrities aren’t normal? @Axis wqzy not kidding, there are so many who need to pay, fucking evils killer!!! Just hope they will pay @George Stobbart and kill children, hunting them and eating them!! @Jeremy Camus its not conspiracy theories dig deeper idiot Yeah! And as if we believe that he\\'s in his kitchen!! Deep fake   Take a look at his neck. It’s not really him Those jowls are not Tom. They think we\\'re stupid...bad new for them though...WE\\'RE AWOKE!!!! WWG1WGA!!! @Arch Glass He does look more like \"Jim Hanks\" than Tom Hanks.  LOL It\\'s his brother Yup! So, suddenly Tom\\'s hair is gone, what\\'s up with that?  Obviously he\\'s in front of a green screen.  I can only hope the pain he receives is equal to the pain he inflicted upon the children he abused.  Eff U Tom! @KM what else does cnn and fox news tell you to think? @KM https://youtu.be/6CTqAXvnDSs https://youtu.be/6CTqAXvnDSs @KM Please do not put God in this. Hanks is as sick as fck and you have no idea. WTF The green screen is so obvious. Someone with a mansion and that’s his kitchen? How dumb do they think we are. We know this is a deepfake. We know he\\'s either detained or simply gone. We know.\\nWWG1WGA M Goldey you can fake any voice ~ many ways, you’d be surprised. I don’t do any voice verification on my accounts . @M Goldey hahaha there are dozens of voice actors that can sound exactly like him and you CAN deep fake a voice. There are so many options to easily fool you. @James Powell His brother also sounds and looks a lot like him. Which makes it easier for the deepfake James Powell thats some scary shit U can’t deepfake his voice u idiot Are you under House Arrest Tom? Hands and neck 😂 Yeah bad acting,  everything\\'s fake 🍕 😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂 @Joshua Hopping I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT WASN\\'T HIM!! A sixty million dollar mansion, yet his kitchen is smaller than my apartment. Wtf @Shorty yeah the way the skin moves not normal michael Bencs the kitchens still bigger than mine 😂 60 million dollar mansion and construction grade kitchen.counter and a stainless steel small sink...people are not naive anymore @Ripster It certainly looks fake to me. Mark Nelson they think we’re stupid We heard you got arrested If he was arrested then wouldn’t there be articles or him on the news? 🤮🤮🍕🍕🍕🍕 @Bruno Duarte it is @warmsunny today or maybe deep fake Heard the same it’s Jim wow He\\'s in front of a green screen!!! Hologram His voice doesn\\'t even sound like he\\'s in a kitchen. Sounds like he\\'s in a smaller room. That’s his bald bro, Jim Hanks. Those are not the hands of a 64 year old... Did you take your dose of Andrenochrome today???? 🤮🤮🍕🍕🍕🍕 warmsunny today  are you wearing your tinfoil hat? #Adrenochrome 💉\\U0001fa78\\n\\n#PaidPuppets 🎭 @warmsunny today That was not anything pertaining to Adrenochrome.. Though Toms brother looks and sounds just like Tom. At 1:57 minutes into video, screen shows a white board with black drawing of adremecome. This is also Tom’s brother who is bald. Not Tom or aka Mr. Rockerfeller. Q up the indictments. Red pills for strength.  It\\'s not about the virus. 💯 Tom \" let\\'s pretend we have covid\" Hanks 😭😭😭😭 U know what lol 😆 Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were both arrested in Australia and are both currently being held at a high security facility where they are both singing like Canaries in hopes of not being executed for crimes against humanity (in particular Children). They are never coming home again and will never be free ever again. This charade is meant to lure Hollywood into a false sense of security.  Nothing can stop what is coming... \"Nothing\". Tiberiusduck I wish you are right 🤞 Hey Tom did you guys get a bad batch of Adrenochrome? anna baker yeah. Before I updated myself I was like “JESUS CHRIST WHAT?” Because the past three years I’ve been buried in schoolwork and such. @Lori Woolford have you noticed how much some of these celebrities have aged since they cant get their fix of adrenochrome 🤮🤮🤮🤮🍕🍕🍕 Do you think we\\'re gonna believe he\\'s at home? Do you really think we are that $t.up-!D? 🍕 Tom\\'s neck got castaway..!?.. @Duke of Haphazard watch the neck. Thats definitely toms head on someone else\\'s body. How thick are you?. imagine the real tom hanks is dead and his body is deep down in the ocean....but nobody can conform this since no one can go out from their home....meanwhile deepfake tom hanks on tv persuading and convincing people to take bill gates vaccine..... Look at his shoulder on the left,glitchy as Howz GITMO treating ya, Tommy Boy? Enjoying the warm Caribbean sun, just like in the good old days @ Pedo Island? Wow, It is all coming out. 🍕 @Morgan what !! No way is Trump no where close to Kennedy !! Trump is also good friend\\'s with the Clintons amongst others!! Trump is not trying to finish what  Kennedy has started !! The President is a Globalist look at his policies and his administration. @MerCenary what!!!! No way is Trump even close to JFK!!! trump is gonna finish what jfk started https://youtu.be/PxXQ7SGEZtw Wanna hear a coronavirus joke? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou probably won\\'t get it, just like Tom. Tom hanks? You mean the CGI, notice his neck, his young hands, no wedding band. 🍕 In another video he has permanent wrinkles as he making a speech for graduates The cgi really glitches 2.03-2.11..dam Good work detective!! Time is running out fast That was cringe... 🤮🍕🍕🍕🍕 nodozz2 they always are I agree with you Is that his new kitchen in Guantanamo Bay? 🤔 \"America\\'s Dad\" ? Just like Bill Cosby, oh my. @Jonathan Esser What is \"Team Q\" ? So that part I don\\'t get do you think he\\'s forced to say that as penance? Like team Q is exposing them and forcing them to say that or do you think it\\'s just him paying homage to cabal? It\\'s tough to tell who the symbolism is for sometimes the this seems like they got Hanks. I\\'m starting to understand the get your popcorn references Still don\\'t care for Hollywood!!! 🤮🤮🤮🍕🍕🍕🍕 https://youtu.be/PxXQ7SGEZtw CREEP. Who else is TIRED of these narcissists? Down with hollywood! Why is the kitchen a green screen???? Mike Sain seriously?  Why People thought Jimmy Kimmel\\'s kitchen was green screen too. Until he proved them wrong. Moron Look closer.....thats a deep fake. It\\'s not you can see his shadow in the back round Didn’t some of these people fly to Epstein’s island a few times??🤢 https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508273-jeffrey-epsteins-little-black-book-redacted.html alot of people mike bloomburg alot here is his book 1:13 WTF was that? Look on the right in between the bowl and the silver coffee machine thing. There\\'s this black thing for a fraction of a second right before he says \"female actors\"? \\n\\nEDIT: Again at 2:19, this time it\\'s more zoomed in and easier to see. I agree, you seen something. We all did. Yo good catch Well spotted fren a strange shadow of something He\\'s standing in front of a green screen @Emily Do you realize how good Hollywood\\'s CGI technology is these days? It\\'s obviously something funky going on here. @Emily what do you think now?. @Emily You are correct, made a mistake. Look at his neck instead. Definitely something weird going on there. He\\'s not. When he moves his hands, it casts a shadow on the silver thing to his right You fool no one. You did, but not anymore. The world is watching. \"The great actor?...\"  not so much these days. Nice suit, can\\'t wait to see your next outfit. Something in orange perhaps? And lots of bling, like a bracelet perhaps? The world looks forward to your next \"act.\" calli lily blessings!!!! @FreeTime Player:  SNL is exactly what I was talking about, IDIOT. @Miss Marissa Castaneda: Yes, thousands believe that this creature may have done one of its final performances for now. What a pity, such a nice family man, lol. Thinking we should all pass on his great work to others,  \"Toddlers and Tiaras\" comes to mind, as well as many other notable works that this  great American \"actor\" has graced us  with recently, in all forms of media. Isn\\'t social media great? Such lovely friends it has too … and a medal of freedom award to boot, wow.The friends one keeps … hmmm ... God Bless you Marissa . calli lily THIS IS WHY I CAME TO THIS VIDEO. he’s caught. calli lily It\\'s SNL you idiot, of course it\\'s staged There’s nothing secret that it will not come on the light ✝️ He’s not at home. He’s got a fresh prison hair cut and the background is fake. Q Not Tom.  He makes exaggerated movements with his mouth.  His brother! Deep fake using his brothers voice. Tom, remember when you went to that one Island 🌴, we do!  That also was on the Q cards. WWG1WGA 🙏❤️🇺🇸🙏❤️🇺🇸🙏 🤮🤮🍕🍕🍕🍕 Good one 👌 Looks like a deep fake!  Look around his neck when he says, \"take care of each other...\" you can see the glossy superimposed face. Not buying this one!! This is the very similar feeling watching this... like watching an ex you broke up with after you know what s/he really was . Including her/his friends. The whole excitement the magic and the joy is no longer there... like looking at a stranger you once loved... just an empty box, a gorgeous elaborated box. Omg well said.. that\\'s exactly how it feels 👌 I\\'m Tom Hanks. My wife and I have coronavirus, just thought I\\'d let you know. I\\'m Tom Hanks. His kitchen has caught my attention! It is quite cheap and poor, so is his monologue. @Maria Aquos damn maria 7 comments and almost all of them are on this video what really resonates with you. Because with my 700 IQ big brain intellect I can see you really like something about Tom. Me being an intellectual have no opinion and am not biased. I was created in a lab near Massachusetts. I was created to think like a human but as smart as AI and was built by the greatest minds. Like Einstine Beethoven and others. When you die you don\\'t actually die you just go to cuba. Lots of people in cuba. Cuba isn\\'t even a place its just a big door into the second earth were the government and big pharma pull the strings and take out of pockets. The corona didn\\'t happen its a hoax to get people scared so they by crisco oil. Yes im telling the truth Woah... imagine getting so offended by someone on the internet. k20\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I wish\\xa0I were a celebrity like him, but wait! Are you plain stupid or just utterly uneducated asking me such a low IQ question? Are you allergic to the truth? The ugly truth hurts, doesn\\'t it? Show us youre kitchen maria Looking pretty bad without your adrenochrome What a vile being We Know. Hellyweird & frens are FIN #GodWinS #WWG1WGA #KAG2020 So this is one big joke to Hanks.  Not so funny to people who have lost loved ones, lost jobs and have no money.  We can thank China, WHO, and that ghoul, Bill Gates.  We get all your coded messages and symbols.  So we get the pizza reference.  Is that what yours is or is it hot dogs or pasta or pizza?  How\\'s that son of yours?  You did a great job with him.  Saw him in a video.  He was really \"trippin\\'.\" https://youtu.be/1-tWfEfP3MY?t=1236 shows what he did Will the real Tom Hanks please stand up? Oh wait, he can\\'t, because he\\'s under house arrest. #WWG1WGA 🤮🍕🍕🍕 This video looks so weird, his own house? Bruh that looks like a green screen and \"Tom\" looks like CGI, just saying. That is not Tom Hanks!!! Its a deep fake. A good one....but its got flaws. I am so proud to be a part of all the people in the comments. DEFUND HOLLYWOOD Who stand in the kitchen wearing a suit? Why would he take an old typewriter to Australia? Lisa Warren his typewriter brand name is corona.  No joke Its the most High tech thing he owns If you’re alive. Repent while you still have time. Jesus came to save sinners. Repent and put your faith in Him. #Adrenochrome 💉\\U0001fa78\\n\\n#PaidPuppets 🎭 Deep fake face and green screen background. That ain\\'t him. \"From his kitchen\"? This is clearly a green screen. You can see the blury edges on his jacket on the top left side. That was horrible... It fooled no one. 🤮🍕 Background lighting and Tom Hanks lighting doesn\\'t match at all. He is in front of a green screen. His face looks too fat, the last picture I saw of him he looked thin TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT Tom! Anyone else underwhelmed by his kitchen? Yeah they should\\'ve used a better green screen lol. kirk1kirk it’s green screen More like, whats wrong with his hair? If you truly believe that that is him then you\\'re mistaken. Look at his neck, the collar, the folds. The part where skin and collar meet. That\\'s not real. Those hands dont match those of Hanx. What is the media trying to convey here? Either he\\'s edited into that \\'body\\' and in that fake setting or that this is deepfake...  Either way, why would they need to fake it? That\\'s the question His brother does voiceovers for him. At 1:20 he bends over and you can see it\\'s his brother\\'s hairline. oumaima Z it’s CGI @The Restoration of Dr Who no Agree 100%.  Even this \"coronavirus threat\" is fake.  Lots of ultra-rich people are now in very exclusive luxury, hotels, resorts and water parks. The Restoration of Dr Who his voice superimposed on cgi that isn’t his real body Hey entertainment tonight everyone knows, this is just sad q got ur tongue ? Hanx riding dirty with that #adrenochrome Green screen... America\\'s Dad aka taken over from Bill Cosby Mass media will do all in their power to protect tom hanks reputation during a time where it seems the walls have closed in on celebs like oprah , ellen amd himself.

Because it does suck, but you survive.  No need to lockdown the economy over it either. No one cares. Another liberal elite. Glad he beat coronavirus but celebrities made this 10x worse. I see u haven\\'t let up That wasnt tom hanks , that was a c.g.i, face implant ... \"Thats tom hanks! \"\\n\\nNo it is not.

This is really life with a family and we all could use something to make us smile.😊 Positive smiling She sure did make me laugh... Hi Katherine Blackburn, please watch my videos She is adorable I love how Jenna is with kids and how she is with everyone love to watch her and her kindness to everyone bless you This is what I\\'m talking about fun with the family HI Arnold Oliver, please watch my videos This is actually awesome.

It is SO great to see Hoda laughing so hard <3. I miss seeing them together..But this is great! What beautiful families you both have ! Adorable children and fabulous parents...and grandparents too !

Barbara-Marie I thought I was the only one that noticed Every time that I see Jenna in the mornings I’m not sure what’s with her face it is always swollen she looks like she’s on some kind of steroids , hmmm 🤔 Jenna does Lol yeah good internet Time in the kitchen with a loved reduces stress most def, if it don’t, because it’s my assumption, I personally feel that this is soothing, for sure.

THANK You fer how both of You two mommas Live Yer CHILDREN.  THANK You so much. And jenna You have ah WONDERFUL Mum in granma Laura bush. I have Alweys RESPECTED Laura as the only dear woman who shares and gives of herself and loves her daughters and grandchildren ta pieces and it shows. THANK You ladies this CERTAINLY made Mh dey and helped Me laugh and made ame smile. At least the child isn\\'t turning into a demon yet.. Her entering was probably staged but what she did while there wasn\\'t. They dont have jenna on TV to much.....wonder why she was shape shifting on rita Wilson\\'s interview.......dont go grey like granny witch.... Nepotism at its worst.  NBC loves hiring people based on name rather than merit.  You think if her last name wasn’t Bush she would be working at a local station much less on a network? Pizza hey Jenna?......hmmm Gods looks fabulous and is so skilled here. omg hoda I don\\'t trust these people. Of course not. It\\'s msm Not to be a Debbie downer, but sprinkles are 100 percent wax.  Just sayin. Are u gonna talk to hush Intelligence?.... Don\\'t think so. I like your show, BUT, I hate when you ladies say YOU ALL ,  ALL THE TIME IT\\'S HORIBLE, even when Kelly Clarkson says it, it\\'s horrible, boring, you\\'s say it WAS 2 MANT TIMES. GIVE IT A REST.  👎👎 Hoda is such a born again phony. Look, she doesn\\'t smile or laugh, she grimaces. Then we have the fruit of George W\\'s loins; you gotta back off those fried pies girl.  I know they\\'re good enough to bring a tear to a glass eye, but sooner or later, you\\'re gonna have to share the screen with HK. So sick of America\\'s vanity I’m sorry, am I the only one who can’t stand Jenna (Sappy) Bush-Hag!  I can’t turn the channel fast enough.

       " 'Europe its like no other continent ...full of history , culture , traditions, spectacular places , stunning sights , marvel architectures.

I would love to travel back to Europe and visit some more historical places and ruins. Just beautifully put together Touropia!! Great job! Thanks and much love! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF_5d006TUQ Lol, should be called “some attractions of Europe” \"top 25 and \"25 top\" aren\\'t the same things Crni Covek yup there should be a Top 1000 list instead the title is exactly what you say though. A list like this is always subjective.  All European countries have beautiful sights. Go to the Tatras in Slovakia, Gdansk in Poland, Riga in Latvia, Sintra in Portugal, Plovdiv in Bulgaria, Hallstatt in Austria, Novi Sad in Serbia, Ohrid in North Macedonia etc. Gilgit Baltistan is reopened for tourism in Pakistan\\r\\nhttps://www.myinsideclub.co/2020/08/gilgit-baltistan-is-reopen-for-tourism.html #25 @0:58 - Leaning Tower of Pisa\\n#24 @1:58 - Canals of Bruges\\n#23 @2:59 - Cliffs of Moher\\n#22 @4:12 - Pompeii\\n#21 @5:43 - Meteora \\n#20 @7:05 - Sagrada Familia\\n#19 @8:21 - Tallinn Old City\\n#18 @9:51 - Tower Bridge\\n#17 @11:04 - Neuschwanstein Castle\\n#16 @12:11 - Mont Saint-Michel\\n#15 @13:29 - Scottish Highlands\\n#14 @14:46 - Lake Bled\\n#13 @15:56 - St. Basil\\'s Cathedral\\n#12 @17:00 - Dubrovnik Old Town\\n#11 @18:15 - Canals of Amsterdam\\n#10 @19:43 - Eiffel Tower\\n#9 @20:58 - Prague Old Town\\n#8 @22:15 - St. Peter\\'s Basilica\\n#7 @23:23 - Canals of Venice\\n#6 @24:56 - Palace of Versailles\\n#5 @25:58 - Fjords of Norway\\n#4 @27:26 - Alhambra\\n#3 @28:45 - Hagia Sophia\\n#2 @29:57 - Acropolis\\n#1 @31:16 - Colosseum\\n\\nbtw, we\\'re taking 2-3 years and flying around the world in a small plane.  If you like travel, check out our profile! Thanks. I would switch the cliffs of Moher with Matterhorn . I would also switch the Scottish highlands with Meteora. Finally, I\\'d switch something for at least one Gothic cathedral.\\nThe problem with the list in the video is that it changes between individual sights in cities and whole cities (with many things to see). Personally I would much much rather see Tower castle than Tower bridge, by the way. Obviously they are right next to each other. \\nThe list seems like a hodgepodge as it is. It\\'s as if they wanted sights from different parts of Europe. But seriously, Canals of Bruges over Siena or the Loire Valley Chateaux? Gilgit Baltistan is reopened for tourism in Pakistan\\r\\nhttps://www.myinsideclub.co/2020/08/gilgit-baltistan-is-reopen-for-tourism.html CZEch europe hiking video https://youtu.be/ENav1mzUwmw @Around The World Again Far from Miserable but if they had been to London and thought Tower Bridge was the best it had to offer they must of either been blindfolded or had the worst tour guide in the the world or as I presume not attended at all if you would like an extensive list of best places to visit and times of year to go let me know and I will quiet happily compile one. I\\'m from Milan, so I shouldn\\'t complain because several Italian locations have been named in the video, but there are more interesting locations than Pisa, both in Italy and in other European countries ...\\r\\nAs for Italy, how is it possible to prefer Pisa to the magnificent Florence?\\r\\nAnd I would like to point out the wonderful lakes of Northern Italy, a must see: Lake Garda, Lake Maggiore, Lake Como, and... oh yes: the small Lake Orta... small but so so romantic, unique and picturesque! What about Switzerland and Austria? The alps are definitly missing here Italy is bordered by the Alps with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia ... therefore in reality this country has the majestic Alpine beauties of all these countries combined:) Hélène Blasquez ofc I know that. I meant the alps in general. I‘m from Switzerland, so I know what you can do here and it‘s definitely more than just skiing just like you said You know the Alps are also in other countries like Italy or France? and that they are many others things to see/do in Switzerland and Austria than skiing ;) Been to 16 sites out of the list but can assure you Europe has much more to offer.\\nCouple honorary mentions:\\nPlitvice lakes in Croatia, Florence, caste in Rhodes, castle of Malbork, Avignon, Newgrange in Ireland etc. The Loire valley chateaus in France.\\nSt Petersburg in Russia. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF_5d006TUQ You are right! Each European country has many wonderful places! It would take a 10 hour video to show all Europe\\'s jewels!!! Santorini, Epidaurus, Zagoria Villages, Vikos canyon in Greece. San Gimignano, Perugia, Parco Nazionale del Gran Sasso, Cinque Terre in Italy. Camargue, Gorges du Verdon, Gorges du Tarn, Almost everything in Bretagne in France...……. I\\'m surprised you guys chose places like Lake Bled and Sofia over Portugal, Poland or Austria @innosanto St Petersburg as a whole, especially the Winter Palace, Peterhof, and the Summer Palace.\\nAnd the chateaus of the Loire Valley in France (especially Chambord and Chenonceau).\\nAnd the medieval city of Carcassonne (I don\\'t know a surviving larger medieval fortification in Europe).\\nAnd some German castles too, Neuschwanstein isn\\'t the only major one.\\nAnd the nature of Switzerland is the most beautiful in all of Europe, but I guess you meant that by \"the Alps as a whole\".\\n\\nps: some cathedrals are worth mentioning too, they were the highest human structures in the world from the middle ages to near the end of the 19th century. Gothic architecture deserves its tribute. I think the list is more oriented monuments instead of cities or landscapes. Alps or Mediterranean islands are gorgeous, I love Lisbon & Porto, but I think Florence  and St Petersburg should be in the list. And how about Switzerland? 🤔 You mean Hagia Sophia? The largest structure and largest hall in the world for more than one thousand years, and a groundbreaking architecture type for someone that knows evolution of the architecture and the built environment (first time the Roman basilica and circular roman structures (such as Pantheon) were united in one structure through engineering innovations and at a great scale) It is a clear choice, no surprise.\\nEven more surprising? most of the structures even smaller ones in history even one thousand years later were built in more than a century but the Hagia Sophia in 5 years. Not only because of recources, but also because Anthemius of Tralles the mathematician was expert in logistics. So it was a logistics masterpiece as well etc etc.\\n\\n\\nThere are places that should be at least mentioned as contenders or close calls though, at least ten.\\n3-4 of them for me out of the sights I know would be:\\nToledo in spain, \\nRoman Agora (together with the Colloseum) and the Pantheon together with those, \\nSantorini, \\nFlorence, \\n(if Anatolia peninsula counts) Cappadocia together with the Byzantine christian villages in the rocks, \\r\\nthe Alps as a whole,\\r\\nCinque Terre\\r\\nSenbrun palace in Vienna?\\r\\ncanals of St Petersburg\\nVolcanic formations of Iceland, \\nKnossos perhaps (together with Akrotiri), \\n\\nNational Palace of Pena or Belem Tower in portugal, \\nwhite cliffs of Dover, \\n\\n\\netc 0:46 Cliffs of Moher - Co. Clare, Ireland\\n21:07 Vltava River & Charles Bridge at the center of the photo (middle bridge) towards Mala Strana\\n\\n21:17 Charles Bridge - Prague, Czech Republic\\n21:26 Old Town Square - Prague, Czech Republic\\n22:04 Astronomical Clock - Prague, Czech Republic In my opinion ... you miss Florence and Mine Salt in Cracovia (Poland), both better than many location you  mentioned.... Gilgit Baltistan is reopened for tourism in Pakistan\\r\\nhttps://www.myinsideclub.co/2020/08/gilgit-baltistan-is-reopen-for-tourism.html From Milan... how is it possible to prefer Pisa to the magnificent Florence?? best place to visit in Italy is Napoli Should\\'ve put Florence over tower bridge Im pretty sure these are opinionated Canals of Bruges are awesome when I was there in 6/2018. should try to give Ghent a visit then!  I live there and  there really is no city like it. In my  opinion it is most beautiful at night, when the majority of people leave and the lights turn on. Yes, we know, we had to clean them afterwards This look fantastic, so beautiful!  I\\'d love to get footage looking like this someday.

Hope I get to visit these places someday. congratulation on the right pronunciation of the foreign locations Wow, the mountains are heavens!!! Love those destinations so much.😍🥰 Hope to make way there. Good selection,  but I miss Florence.... Thank you Best travel channel on YouTube , I love all of your videos 💗💗💗💗 As an American, I\\'m so glad I live here now. There\\'s more to Russia than Moscow\\'s Saint Basil\\'s Cathedral. Saint Petersburg, another great Russian city, is A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN. Every corner of the city has its own magic far greater than Moscow. Just saying... I\\'ve only been to 13 of them so far..12 more to go on my bucket list..! Best of the World and then you should visit some of all the other places, not mentioned in this video. Greetings from Denmark @A___A B___B ou better stick to studying Well, I have been to 3 of them.\\nMeteora and Acropolis in Greece.\\nIn Old Town (Prague) I am almost every weekday, becouse my high school is in there.\\nAlso I have realised that I have been 6.5 km from Lake Bled (bike tour), but not really in the place.\\nAnd I have also been to many Croatian towns, but not exactly to Dubrovnik. Don\\'t bother. It\\'s unlikely that you\\'ll understnd what you\\'re looking at anyway Flipadaaaaaaaa of MUNDO MUNDIAL 😍🌷🐵 Lake Bled,Sofia, Portugal, Poland , Austria and well, quite a few place\\'s are great place\\'s to visit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF_5d006TUQ With love from sLOVEnia Europe is the best continent for 2000 years I\\'m from Milan. I stayed several months in USA and I had good job prospects in New York, in fashion sector, but the idea of living in a country without seeing around me anymore the presence of \"History\", without the \"Perfume of the Past\"... dissuaded me. I could have lived in any other major European city, but in America ... no.\\r\\nOur European cities smell of eternity. Well, tbh, we didn\\'t do all that much between 200 and 1200, but otherwise yeah, it sure beats KFC and McDonalds Aqw aq :)  NO SHIT -, really? i Did 11 of them :P hopefully more to come :) You know what pisses me off? I was in Italy and planned to see all of those things (placed in Italy) .. but THEN the pandamic happened and I had to go home.... Only saw the Colosseum from outside..\\nHope this will all be over soon so we can all travel again!❤🌍 You mean \"plandemic\". Beautiful presentation of the historical places thanks This is very cool, thank you!!! These are all beautiful places, but the massive amounts of tourists themselves spoil the magic. You can actually see that in this video. Better go to places where there\\'s interaction with locals is possible, or you have reasons to interact with them. Try a \\'working on an organic farm\\' holiday, volunteer help to rebuild ancient sites, or cycle around one of the flatter countries and really be in it. Europe really offers the best of everything in a very \"limited\" area. Love it. In a couple of hrs, you can be in a totally different place and setup. Just brilliant.

For the ones who want to know the real history of the pyramids... you can start with the lifetime investigation of Sir John Antony West. Hope my comment doesn\\'t get deleted I think what disgusts me more is that we are told it is a lion, but the sphinx is missing its trademark tuft at the end of its tail..   Recently they uncovered 8 million mummified animals(nearly all dogs) in Saqqara..  I am going to guess that the Sphinx was once a dog..  Also, no mention of the large(one-piece) solid concrete head of an African female..??  I give Discovery UK a big fat \"0\" for researching this.. 😔 In the book \"The serpent in de sky\", by the recently deceased John Anthony West, the work of another specialized researcher: R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, is disclosed in a more accessible language.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2PwwtFmTi4 Thank you 🙏🏾 Since when was they talking about pyramids? If it\\'s only 4000 years old, where did the water erosion come from?\\nIt takes thousands of yrs to erode like that, and there hasn\\'t been rain like that in Egypt for more than 9000 years! Not an \"Egyptologist\"\\nbut I do love to research a good mystery. If you had low end Pc and Playing Assassin Creeds Origin , You might have been bored of waiting and seen the hints that said that it\\'s a Stone that is unique ,inside of Sphinx is filled with Silicia and It\\'s made of one of Uniue stones and stone mason who build it has been working for pharos more or Long @Bread Stick Squad true. Even 1000 years is already a long time If it was wind erosion.....why did the body erode so badly and the head looks ok...ish.🤣 @Olek Nagórka The story of the great flood is consistent with the formation of the black sea.  There\\'s a hypothesis that there was sort of a natural dam in place that broke and formed the sea during that time, around 7150 BC. Wind erosion? I mean desert storms can cause significant damage. That seems the most plausible. What about the geological age of the Sphinx Enclosure?... much older than 4000... and the repair work done? And that the limestone blocks used in the building in front of the Sphinx were cleanly cut  from the Sphinx enclosure... @ThexBorg Gunung Padang , indonesia Albeit Einschtien \\nQuit your shit!

A.) The Sphinx was not an artifact of Khufu. (The Great Pyramid wasn\\'t either and was never a tomb.) Khufu may have carved his head into an eroded stump of the head that was put there when the Sphinx was actually built, at the latest nine thousand years ago, according to famous geologist Robert Schoch who analyzed the WATER EROSION on the Sphinx. (Keep in mind that Egypt hasn\\'t had enough rainfall to erode anything in 10,000 years. At the time the Sphinx was built,  5 thousand years before the pharaohs, the head may have been of a lion or an Anubis type dog. B.) There is a persistent effort of Egyptologists to cover up evidence of our very ancient history, shown by the truly megalithic structures of a much farther back antiquity and they erroneously fold it into far later times. Anomalous evidence has to be crammed into their paradigm that there was no advanced civilization before a few thousand years ago. Purveying this bunk has earned Egyptologists the title of \"quackademics.\"  It has taken engineers, geologists, and others from the \"hard sciences\" to expose either the intentional obfuscation or ineptitude  of Egyptologists about what are obviously extremely ancient structures of a lost civilization many, many thousands of years ago. C) This video is a splendid example of disinformation by quackademics. If you want more accurate information, investigate the works of Robert Schoch, John Anthony West, Robert Bauval, Graham Hancock. These authors have been called the 4 Horsemen, so much have they destroyed the quackademic paradigm. Heru\\nThank you 🙏 \\nSaid everything I wanted to say 🙂 Mike Kruger .......i agree with you completely. Most delusional folks in these threads will disagree, but they are the bottom end of society mentally. This is where they come to pretend they are smart hahahahahaa. CUCKOO hahahahhahahha Good work and stay well my good friend. Don’t get your history from Ancient Aliens Schoch and Hancock are cranks.   The Sphinx was built for Khafre at the same time as his pyramid, which was a tomb.  Lower levels of the Sphinx are made of softer limestone than the head, hence the erosion.  Wind blown sand will create such patterns- no rain needed. Willie Katz = ghetto fuck toy for all the big thugs The nose was where historical accuracy was thrown out! Pure fantasy. KingJay listen.... if he has to explain this comment then you don’t deserve to know! Triple 334 but it wasn’t so hot back then , as they say it was all green, I think the ones who build the pyramids left from there when the weather turn to shit. And the ones who could handle it were stuck behind, this what I said made more sense than yours Triple 334 why we want to believe that look at the Egyptians today and Africans do u think they were smart enough to build those ? Because they would have done something to remember for the last 3000 years but no they haven’t done anything, I’d rather believe in aliens my friend @George Idimachukwu just because I\\'m educated doesn\\'t mean I\\'m not black and just because i don\\'t blackwash the ancients doesn\\'t mean I\\'m less black. The sphinx does NOT have African features! Black people just think it does when it has the face of King Khafre and he had a long pointy nose! https://www.google.com/amp/s/spiritsdancinginthenight.tumblr.com/post/174954873472/digital-edit-of-king-khafre-based-upon-the-famous/amp just because Egypt is apart of the Africa continent does not mean the Egyptians were ethnically African! There\\'s DNA proof confirming the Egyptians were connected to middle eastern people and the Egyptian mummies have straight/wavy hair and some even have red hair and red hair originated in middle eastern people!!! The Egyptians wasn\\'t white or black they were middle eastern with tanned brown reddish to olive skin. Similarly to the native Americans @Napoleon Highbrou anything else? The lion body has a trap door on the top of his head @Junior Guevara They covered it up Wowow really I didn\\'t know that. Is it still there or did they cover it up ? Wasn\\'t it originally just a hole? Anyways, they sealed it up. It\\'s not exactly a trapdoor. there is also one in front of the paws that was covered up by wooden planks. there\\'s one at the bottom of the left paw as well. 1:02 I laughed immediately How these limited knowledge scientists can judge those egypt kings...damn ... “The Sphinx, the Greek etymology of which expresses the idea of embracing or tightly holding, is composed of four parts taken from four symbols. These are the head of WOMAN, the body of a BULL, the paws of a LION and the wings of an EAGLE. This fantastic combination is divested of monstrosity as soon as the meaning of the symbols is understood.\\n   The WOMAN’s head personified human intelligence, which has to consider the aim of its aspirations, its means of attaining them, the obstacles to be avoided and barriers to be broken.\\n   The BULL’s body means that person, armed with science, goaded by a tireless will and bearing the yoke of each trial with ox-like patience, must slowly travel by his/her own road toward to success or failure.\\n   The LION’s paws mean that, in order to attain the aim set by his/her intelligence, one must not only desire he/she must also venture; it is not enough merely to work, it is necessary sometimes also to fight and to make a place for oneself by force.\\n   The EAGLE’s wings, folded over the Sphinx’s powerful mass, mean that person must hide his/her plans beneath a thick veil until the moment come to act with a resolution that if need be reaches the heights of audacity.\\n The Sphinx was therefore neither an idol nor the devouring monster imagined by Greek fables: it was the symbol of the incalculable strength that can be used by the human will when directed by the highest intelligence.” The Eagle\\'s wings. Folded over the Sphinx\\'s powerful mass, mean that person must hide his/her plans beneath a thick veil until the moment come yo act with a resolution that if needed be reaches the heights of audicity. Well written and thought-out. wait for the \"Aliens\" comments geez, they\\'re still pushing this narrative that the Great Sphinx looks like Khafra. Even after a forensic scientist proved that Khafra\\'s profile is flat, and the Sphinx\\'s profile is prognathic, they\\'re still trying to brain-wash people into believing this lie. Only the naive and ill-informed will be easily duped. Awwww diddums threw all its toys out of the cot hahahaha you know shit kid @Jeremy Kirkpatrick keep posting bitch maybe your masters will give you extra dinner tonight They used digital scanning you uneducated halfwit ,and it\\'s Khafre. sheesh next time research before you post you peasant Even if we believe such lies, in what way is it going to help us in our daily lives? 100% more dis information to perpetuate the archaeological lies just to justify their jobs. All this is Hypothetical and there is no fact for these theories, no one knows for sure anything , suggesting is bombastic and arrogant. @Bante Hayes \"Science is not about knowing, science is about confidence.\"\\n\\nI\\'m sure confident that the content of this documentary is bullshit. They make up some cat god worshipping story only by ignoring geological and historical facts:\\n\\n- The vertical water erosion on the walls\\n- The fact, that the sphinx was not built during Kaphres reign, but renovated, which you can see in the distinct type of architecture\\n- The fact, that although the head always stuck out of the sand, it is the least eroded part of the statue, while the body, which was buried in the sand for about 3000 years, shows the most erosion\\n\\nAgain, because of these facts, I\\'m confident, that this documentary is bullshit. What the fuck do you know? Bombastic ohh that is such a chunky word I think I will say it regularly today Imagine if men from Japan tried to tell the world why stone henge was where it was and what the people that made it looked like. So, it must be an offering to the cat gods, then? Isn\\'t it just wonderful how modern day humans have everything figured out? This Egypt stuff is ridiculously interesting I know right for real. Wait! \"The harsh desert winds sanblasted his features away\". No! Neapolean and his army shot the features off the sphinx. Real Badman it’s public knowledge; instead of typing down a comment go search for it yourself You have any historical evidence to prove that? Elomino Pee still dodging the fact that you spread misinformation @john’s assMaybe, but is that a reason for you to get angry? Elomino Pee my reaction when you spread well known misinformation Its known now that the Sphinx wasnt originally created for the pharaoh, the head was recarved. The statue was thousands of years older and as proof it was eroded by water which could of only happened during a specific time period. I get that this has some entertainment purposes, but you have to put the whole picture into perspective and not just the story you want to tell. This is very disingenuous of Discovery Channel. Still waiting dickhead Joe Schmo OK dickhead lets see your evidence you brainwashed halfwit, and an anti vaxxer as well hahahahaha what an imbecile @Gates of Osiris even a blind man can see it isnt in proportion. Head is way smaller than body. Offcourse they recarved it. The build everything perfect. Why would they build the head way smaller? Thank you! Atleast some people know the new facts. @Vash The recarving theory has no real evidence to support it. If you would like some more information about why that\\'s the case, I suggest you watch this: https://youtu.be/haVxxCMwt6I?t=406 Peace.\\nAs per research the lion body statue (currently known as the sphinx) is much older than the Pharaoh dynasty/era. The present head of the pharaoh is carved out of the original lion head. As a result the head is smaller than what it should be proportional to the body.\\nThe pharaoh era, it would seem, is built on older civilisation(s). Cats/lions have always been revered in this part of the world, even before the pharaohs. People arrived here and built their community around an old sacred site on the shores (travel & trade convenience). This is the case with nearly all archeological sites. There is also \\'scientific\\' evidence apart from physical evidence showing multiple layers of history/civilisations on all such sites, be it Incas, Sumerians or Indus Valley, people prefer living & belonging to places with heritage/history for many reasons including superstition and ancestry.\\nThe pharaohs then built the pyramids on marked land aligned to the stars and other earth related magnetic phenomenon ( ; ) though that\\'s..  another story)!\\nRegards Sad 2019 and still not giving the correct information.

I was born in el salvador 1974.ha e u seen footage of the crystal pyramid at botom of ocean in bermuda.the bermuda triangle.there is an entire city coverd by the pyramid.it 5 or 6 times the size of giza.and the marine life there is all bioluminescent.or are they what.what do you think ? @Rico Flores 1979 !!! How old are you now ? anyway it\\'s never too late to learn. I told you i have pyramids in my country that are huge but .not to insult mexico or you country.or any country that has allowed digging to be done in such holly places.we do not allow american or any kind of digging or disturbance of the dead we make enough dead on a daily basses to be woried about the past .however growing up there .i saw with my eyes .i was so small and my friends and i were verry curious as children we were not afraid of anything we went evrywhere.1979 we found a hole into the san andres pyramid in el salvador.we went under for at leat what felt like an hour crawling then it opened up into a tunnel 18 wheeler size there was air shafts allowing lights in .and strang giant size statues that gave off a type of illumanece.the tunnel se to go forever downwards and straight we went straight we heard like growling voices ran back to starting spot got out.i wish i could touch Egypt.i have been to lots of pyramids there is a power only you can wake it within you it is an all healing and knowing power kind of like your brain awakes to a new state of mind .evrytime i touch one .salam alehcam alllah apta what can i say they like cats. 7:07 2:09 it is hilarious how these people act and speak with so much confidence like they lived and hang out with pharaohs 😆 lord help us I found it funny how he said she \"believes\". Everyone knows ancient Egyptians worshipped cats so its nothing to be amused about But its true tho, cat is considered a very sacred animals back in ancient egypt Hahahah true they r so funny... Grim Bones it’s than you dumb bot! Because half the things they said was true, don’t make fun of them you idiot, they know more about this then you or me. The Sphinx is an African woman I am fascinated with Egypt Me too This dumb. The analysis by the NYPD forensics Dept expert Frank Domingo clearly shows that this is a Sub Saharan African woman. This is supported by University studies which confirms\\nThe same thing. It is not Khafra. And that’s just the beginning. Who made this ridiculously outdated video. styles keep em mad ridiculous.

I am Egyptian and I have a strange feeling, as if I had lived a previous life in the era of ancient Egypt and the places that I visited felt I had visited before Profile looks black African Feelthefx Thanks! Please inform this dumb ass GET THA FUCK OUTTA HERE! Albeit Einschtien 😂 Ok what does that have to do with the sphinx Have any of these Egyptologists ever LOOKED at the two heads? Especially in profile there\\'s no resemblance whatever. The Sphinx is not the image of Khafre. The Sphinx already in exist even before the time of Chefra. It is in the image of Horem-Akhet , the Falcon of the Horizon --the god Ra. ARTHUR AMANTE so literally what I had previously explained? @Matthew Dispenza really? Know this, the jewish prophets starting with Amos knew that god are many, but there is only one true God and he is Yahweh the God of Israel. \\' I am He, I am the first and also the last I am... I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending...Which is, and which wad  and which will be\\' says the Lord. ARTHUR AMANTE if you studied enough history, you’d know the descendants of today’s Jews did not worship only who we know today as Yahweh. Yahweh, father of the gods, came from El, the creator, and Yahweh had a wife, Asherah. The ancient Hebrews were allowed to worship more than just Yahweh, they only had to uphold him as most high. They often held Baal, a Canaanite god of the surrounding area, to a standard who had somewhat of meaning to them. NO religion in the ancient world was solely monotheistic, that was unheard of. Monolatry-the worship of a particular god without denying existence of other gods. Please don’t tell me I need to learn something; I constantly read and decipher which history is true and what has been scrapped and rewritten by plagued institutions, therefore I am satisfied. @Matthew Dispenza you\\'re right you must open these books and read them very well and understan them thoroughly. Egyptian worship many gods while jews only one. If you\\'re not satisfied, read your books all over again I hope some of you realize, Judaism borrowed much of the basis of its faith from Egypt. Then Christianity sprung from Judaism after Jesus’s death, obviously. Therefore, ‘Satan’ cannot be Ra. Open a historical document or research book from time to time. I feel the Pyramids were steam towers that used the extreme heat of the sun at the time, natural geysers and underwaters systems below Giza, the super conductivity of Gold and \"cold stone effect\" to create rain clouds to water the land as well as run off streams from the very surface of the pyramids itself. The only problem with my theory is the Nile River been a better source of water as against some unprecedented and expensive experiment. I think there could be a possibility that the Nile probably wasn\\'t the same  river we know today and the region itself could have been totally different from what we know today. This Documentary seems a little confused,\\xa0it is acknowledged by Egyptologists that ancient\\xa0\\xa0Egyptian civilisation\\xa0believed that cats were mystical creatures/Gods and had supernatural powers, according to this documentary\\xa0they mummified and sacrificially buried\\xa01 million specially bred cats...so why then does the archaeologist immediately state that the sphinx is a Lion, that makes no sense surely it is a\\xa0Cat ?? That statue is full of mistry , some say it could be the next step of human evolution  bc there\\'s something greater inside it which we  can\\'t find Scarecrows have been used as a bird deterrent for eons. The Sphinx performed the same function against rodents! copper chisels to carve out the stone....they really said that outloud Yes, they used arsenic copper, variant of copper which is quite hard. Also limestone is a SOFT stone and easy to work with. @dvrmtePretty sure an arrowhead is not equivalent to 70 ton granite blocks cut to an incredible degree of precision. Think before you compare things that are not in any way comparable. And you are implying that I do not \"get out of the house and in tune with nature\" when you have no idea or no knowledge of what I do for a living, which in fact happens to be the \"outdoors and nature.\" Practice what you preach and do not use personal jabs as part of your evidence or no one will believe what you have to say. Yet you\\'re implying it can\\'t be done. LOL That shows your ignorance and lack of common sense. American Indians bored perfectly round holes in rock much harder than limestone using only sand, water and a piece of hollow river cane. They would fill the cane with sand, pour water into it, and put it in a bow drill and after a while they would have a hole. \\nI make flint arrowheads just as the ancients did. I use either a deer antler or copper to chip out the arrowheads. Maybe you should get out of the house and get in touch with Nature. Disinformation. The middle pyramid represents Jupiter or Horus in Egypt. The Sphinx is Horus as a lion and it once had a beak since Horus is also seen as a falcon. \"..as an offering to the cat gods\" Josue Garcia exactly. Shit Nonsense. The Dynastic Egyptians did not carve the Sphinx. Regurgitating rubbish, not history. Black Gods from Sudan Under the statue is the entrance to The City of Arm Egyptologists are so self righteous that they\\'ll stall real scientific progress Here\\'s something for you guys to contemplate. I believe there were two sphinxes two lions 1 directly to the left of the one that was sitting there now. I\\'ve looked at it over and over again and here lately I believe there was another Sphinx I really do look at the pyramid directly behind it look at how the Sphinx is situated and tell me what you think They\\'ve used this as source for energy/electricity. Cat batteries. And I had an old old book with a picture of the so called sphinx but the head was from a very beautiful African like woman. It was an ancient Lexika I remember now. Give thanks and be good. Greetinx and all the best. Tom. Just imagine what life would’ve been like at the prime of Egyptian/Aztec/Mayans/ and Other huge civilisations It used to be  a lion before the Egyptians came along 6000 years later and destroyed it.\\nThis documentary is only half right. Who else was staring at their cat and their cat was staring right back at you while watching this video?? I\\'ve been very interested in the statue fun fact did you know the sfinx is also in Greece methodology it is a lion with a woman\\'s face🇬🇷 That is so crazy, it looks like a human snake/human head like lion. Some kind of cross bread cobra. Discovery channel at the forefront of giving false dates and spreading false information. I watched this video after many hours of other megalithic structures and it had me laughing Q - Mythi, Can you say something about the Egypt Sphinx ? \\r\\n- Of course, the Sphinx was a monument created for the Saxon civilization for over 15,000 years and was made according to the stellar orientation of the time. Many conferences were made in the underground built in the site annually bringing together many of the Atlantis branch of civilizations to the civilizations of the Americas and Asia of the time. Just like your Easter Island, this place was a great meeting of advanced past civilizations. The construction of the pyramids was much later taking advantage of the same regional location that converges to the same points of reference of the stellar races godmothers of these civilizations. \\n\\n\\n-MYTHI, ANDROMEDA The delivery is super nauseating. In summary, Furries existed way back then. Well, thanks to Assassin’s creed origins I knew that information before the release of this video 😹😹 Since it was discovered to be lined up with the constellation Leo at the time it was built 10,000 years ago is a clue it originally had a Lions head but later recarved and even later a beard and paint added and add up how deep the rain erosion is means it was in Giza when the heavy floods came from the ice age thaw 10,000 years ago as after that no heavy rain erosion could have occurred as the climate was dry again !\\nIts likely older than the heavy floods so 12,000 years ago is more likely !\\n\\n\\nIt was a astrology symbol and a calender for the time it was built for us to know they were there and knew astronomy of the stars and used them to measure time ect: \\n\\n\\nThe fiction this video portrays needs the new information discovered , The Sphinx lines up with the summer solstice perfectly dated back to only in the age of Leo by the astrology and is  accurate as back as it is still now !\\n\\nGhram Hancock has the correct information and the erosion proof that also gives us the logic of its Lion design as totally obvious in the time of Leo the lion !\\n\\nIt has been recurved and shaped twice and a beard added to look like the current Pharoh back then ?\\nTo discover such a obvious truth in the age of Leo the Lion destroys other theories for the reason and shape of the Lion being used !\\n\\nB.S. has been imagined but the truth is out there , it was built more than 10,000 years ago !

The Sphinx is at least 9-10,000 years old , probably much older. I stopped watching . The misinformation on this video is mind blowing ! What kind of channel is this ? Why is there an American narrator when  this is on discovery they\\'re completely ignoring that Khafre merely uncovered the sphinx.. Because that contradicts official \"egyptologists\" initial stories and supports the theories of other researchers who aren\\'t as \"established\" or \"mainstream\".  They have to maintain the hierarchy, after all.   Can\\'t have younger and less experienced people in the field expressing their theories and discoveries!

The devil is mentioned in the Bible to be the “arxon” (prince) of this world [John 12 : 31] and yet he does not represent or have any kind of a \"power\" or any kind of authority on man...The out cast archangel only represents an option!

Yes of course...primitive people who did not even know what a WHEEL was, used BRONZE chisel\\'s to construct the sphinx. Someone should pull their head out of where the sun don\\'t shine so they can study some of the more plausible alternative notions as to the origins and purpose of the sphinx. They used copper, not bronze. Copper is much softer than bronze. However American Indians drilled holes in rock much harder than limestone using only a piece of river cane, sand, and water, and they also never invented a wheel. I\\'m often amazed at the ignorance and arrogance of modern people. How do you think ancient people chipped flint arrowheads?

I honestly think the sphinx water erosion is  not rain water because it was used as a sump to drain the area over and over. They may have used some kind of hydrodynamics Basically fill the area up with water Pull some kind of granite plug. use the water pressure for something under the pyramid. by Draining Think of the whole area around the pyramid as a water basin pull the plug. The drain hole drain hole is under the Sphinx with enough angle to get all the head pressure you need for something hydrodynamic.thats why the sphinx is in a large square box just like a sump the head of the sphinx would be just above the water line looking out over water. When the plug was pulled it would expose rest of the body as a decorative piece in the bottom of the sump it might not be rain water everyone it might just be sump drain water erosion There is a lot more Hydrodynamics going on around giza than most people realize Start looking at things around Egypt with Hydro dynamics in mind you’ll be very surprised I think it could of been an explosion in the making of PTFE... although it could be hard to be sure... I know very little about Egptians but i love to learn the history and i feel attracted in a very strong way.  I am certainly not well educated at all.  I have some odd connections to things i see and people i meet and on looking at the Sphinx  i can feel he is a watcher, a guard.  He was recarved, the head at least.  I actually noticed the new head looks not very accurate for the very intelligent builders of the pyramids, look at the height of the ears compared to that of the top of it\\'s head?  The ears are placed too high up, the egyption people and other beings would not of been so careless.  I believe there was other beings there but i believe they left and destroyed to portal to their world so humans can never use it.  I do not no about the history after the pyramids but when i research i shall hopefully find some of the missing pieces i have been looking for.  If i could touch the objects from the pyramids i\\'d have a more visions but simply watching on here they are very faint, not so loud. ',\n",

How come you didn\\'t see Lady Gaga\\'s. @Amna Ilyas OBVIOUSLY!!! @Amna Ilyas lol he is how did he get there tho 👁️👄👁️ She\\'s one of the only celebrities I would actually be friends with @TabibMaster yeeeahh Zendaya too!!! @M ø ø ń ł Í g h t 😐 haha they\\'re ever do that😂 Ntnndhhdhfhdjdidhdhf Yeah just her 💗💗 Taylor Swift: wins a bunch of Grammys \\nAlso Taylor Swift: gets SO disappointed in herself because she couldn’t name any more types of cats \\n😂 7:03 you\\'re right 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂 yasss The face she made afterwards xD I think I have a slight crush on her \"Nickname?\"\\n\\nHer: Yeah, my brother calls me Taffie\\n\\nMe: Yeah, my brother calls me Idiot... Lmaoooooo My brother calls me stupid Zildjan Sebarrotin lol coz you aint pplr thats why...\\n\\nnah just kidding My family calls me Deedee. Haters will only look at the fact that she writes about her ex-boyfriends. They will never know how deep & meaningful her lyrics are. She’s a talented & brilliant song-writer. best part is you realize you love taylor and then listen to Long Live @Scorpio1964 Wines btw ur name already has wine in it.  So it clearly means u r drunk @Nadine Lee sis that person is jobless in short. Nadine Lee - and the fella over there with the hella\\' good hair agrees. Scorpio1964 Wines if you think she’s a shallow being, why are you here? why u wasting ur time commenting on her video? Loved this. She seems like a good friend & a smart businesswoman. agreed Ofcourse she\\'s an infj personality type @Jasper Jones How could you possibly associate her with being remotely \"evil?\" \\nI have to laugh. Yeah that\\'s 100% She seems quite literate as well :) \"What subject would you teach?\"\\nTaylor : \"ENGLISH\"\\n\\n2020 Taylor : *releases folklore*\\nShe literally taught us English!! \\nWow it\\'s was a warning, she knew it was coming, we were literally blind haha I couldn\\'t agree more!! Haha. 💯😂💝 I\\'m a writer, but I also love history and science. “If Calories didn’t count” \\nI want to cry. Daniela Sanchez ik what u mean:( she said, \"healing people\". My gosh. I dont understand how you were bullied. Because she know how unhealed trauma and wounds keep on bleeding....like the 2009 VMAs...\\nEdit: I mean that\\'s why she might\\'ve chose it .....but I still don\\'t get it why people bully her..🤷 They were probably jealous because of her grades. My super power would be magic to make all my favorite fictional characters real. Also because her mum has cancer :( Same Taylor in 2016: would want to teach English\\nTaylor with Folklore: making us all pull out our dictionaries She had co writers but she\\'s super talented...I get ur point The Lakes: Eulogize \\nMe: time for that dictionary again What is the coolest thing in this room?\\nTaylor: the fireplace\\nFireplace: is my heat a joke to you?! @Honey Roasted Infants Meredith. Be like 😭 😂 😂 Her cat: am i just nothing now? She\\'s know, she just pretend that scammy doesn\\'t exist🤣 Watch this then watch Kendall\\'s 73 questions with Vogue. You\\'ll notice how much more nice and classy Taylor is. Kendall just cares about modeling and looking \\'\\'hot\\'\\'\\nTaylor writes beautiful songs and stays clean and classy\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for over 150 likes this was just me ranting to myself lol Taylor is Hella better than her ❤️❤️😍😍 Selena also @Radhika Rao Oh I wasnt pitting them against eachother I was just saying like because I watched Kendall\\'s before this and just thought of what my comment says. Honestly I was just ranting to myself i love taylor swift but pitting women against each other isn\\'t a healthy mindset. we\\'ve all got crowns <3 Too true. Vogue: Why do you think you\\'re the most followed person on Instagram?\\n\\n\\nHer: Because my cats are adorable.\\n\\n\\nShe has always been my idol, but man, that respect just when up times 1,000. She\\'s so down to earth and humble, she is my idol. It\\'s the humility ♥️ Came here after folklore... she\\'s matured so much. I\\'m so proud of her!!✨ Heyy @Almudena Gallego  actually I\\'ve seen it multiple times before. It\\'s just that I realised how much more mature she is now. you have her as your profile pic\\nmakes sense that you like her! :) Same here. I never saw this video before, it\\'s interesting. This is like all the birthdays and Christmases combined. Hhd tu odgu More like 4 lifetimes of birthdays and Christmas\\'s Scarlett Madison Tributes kk Scarlett Madison Tributes alright Marie Novosad u What\\'s the coolest thing in this room?\\n\\nTaylor(while sitting next to a grammy): The fireplace.\\n\\nLol i love her:) You\\'re right lol I love her so much ❤💕💖 This is gold! “get a good lawyer”\\nthe way i gasped so loud omg 😂😂😂😭😭😂😂 folklore same Ķlekdmd \"What subject would you teach\"\\nTay : English\\n\\ntay\\'s lyrics in 2020 : *is it romantic how my elegies eulogize me*\\nMe : tf does that mean am i the only one who is in love with her house Denver DuBois Noo that house looks so nice😭 Emphatically no! I love that house, and her decor and furniture too. Unfortunately she sold it in late 2018...and then today I read that a lot of people have been moving out of Beverly Hills because a wealthy criminal class is moving in--rappers, cartel gang honchos etc. and ruining the safe, nice vibe. Sad. We need 73 questions with the new Taylor swift Alison Bowery probably She never left They might found Joe at her place😂 Wht is all this hype about? The kanye west thing? Can someone tell me? @Sabhyata Singh Yeah! I totally agree!\\nThank you for that comment! Please lets do a part two of this because she has changed so much \"get a good lawyer\" hits different now Guys, let\\'s just be honest...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis isnt your first time watching this @Cheyenne Vogelsang Lol YES, IT IS THO @Tia\\'s Nails lol Definitely not. I\\'ve lost count of how much I can watch it and literally talk along to it now Nop “Healing  people” is the superpower she wants .... she is so good and kind 😭... she is awesome 👏.... and she is my favourite ❤️❣️ Healing* Is becouse her mom 😭 \"What advice would you give to anyone wanting to become a singer?\"\\n\"Get a good lawyer.\"\\n\\nWow, that\\'s sad. @firefly33 Being yourself and being kind and accepting is all she preaches. If you were an actual fan you would know her concert and social media speeches. Getting a good lawyer is very important. I\\'m glad she said that because every artist who writes their music deserves the right to own their music. Also learn to say no. Musicians shouldn\\'t have to sell themselves to the brink of exhaustion. She should have said \\'stay true to yourself \\' and \\'respect your fans\\'. nightmanx62 What do you mean? She writes all of her songs she has ever made in her life. . Taylor : *offers drink*\\nZendaya : *offers drink*\\nKendall : *doesn\\'t offer*\\nMargot : *_offers but forgets to give him_* taylor saying she would teach english so enthusiastically and then proceeding to make folklore where she expanded all of our vocabularies... her mind This is how many people want 73 questions with Ariana Grande 👇🏻 - Host : \"If you had a superpower, what would it be ?\"\\n- Taylor : \"Healing people\"\\nTaylor, ain\\'t you aware that you heal actually ?!\\n(As each of us can do just with a smile or a \"Good Morning \"...) Interviewer: If you could teach one subject in school, what would it be?\\n\\nTaylor: English\\nAlso Taylor: Hey kids, spelling is fun! 7.4k like.. Denise Aguila exactly that vocabulary sis 😌 listen to folklore😌 \"Spelling is fun\" is just an easter egg for the Lover release. Which is 8-2-3 (August 23) She so intelligent and her vocab is better then my life The house is very... her. “The coolest thing I think in this room is the fireplace”\\n\\n\\n\\nGrammy next to her: Am I a joke to you? I love that her house looks so normal. Normal sized rooms, a normal coffee machine..... Just like visit a a friend \"Which one took you the longest?\"\\n\\n\"All Too Well becuase its really an emotional song i keep putting it for months\"\\n\\nim still hoping we get the 24 minute version Whatever Taylor wants, Taylor gets! TheArchitectOfDreams why would she want that she can\\'t get her childhood back Igor Presnyakov ikr! Igor Presnyakov YUSHSHSHSHSHS Igor Presnyakov you are jelous if ur a true swifte u\\'d know why she said - \"healing ppl .\" @zaid Aftab I know. Everyone knows @M V yea she even wrote a song about that. Not necessarilly. Ive always had the same answer to that question, but luckily, dont have anyone close who\\'s sick. I think that would be her answer regardless, but now it really hits her differrently and she probably actually wishes that often :( her mom🥺 Because of her mom 😭 To think that a month after this she met the love of her life and Joe was almost the little kid in \"Love Actually\" where she says here is her favorite movie. There was an invisible string tying them together indeed. i could hear her talk all day lol. taylor is one of the most humble and genuine people out there ❤️️ Taylor: \"The coolest thing in this room is, I think, the fireplace.\"\\n\\nGrammy right next to her: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?!?! She’s so much like Selena Gomez. She’s such a calm, mature, and passionate person. I can see why they’re best friends. Sneha Mallick Thank you ☺️ I\\'m your 6.1k liker. @Girls like girly things dear,Taylor represents and she is the sick side of the world  . She is like a dictator, a dittatore we say in Italy, a pernicious presence. Of course she does not know I exhist, but moving along would mean to turn away, in Front of an issue.  Celebrities like Taylor, not only her, are very bad and sick to the world. Disagree. They\\'re both cool but they\\'re very different personalities and vibes. Also pretty sure they\\'re just close.. they have their own friends that aren\\'t in the industry lol @Frank Frank Franklin were obsessed? Here you are, full of spite for someone that doesn\\'t know you exist 😂 you don\\'t like her? Move along. Her  face features are so unique she’s so special I love her She looks so much happier and healthier now She can be a model she’s so tall ... She is the only one who was so warm and wasn’t just moving around randomly . \"If you had a superpower what would it be?\"\\n-\"healing people\"\\nIsn\\'t she beautifully beautiful ❤️ She healed us with her beautiful songs Yeah you\\'re right 😍😍😍😍 And actually even without superpower, she already healed us with her songs 💕 she\\'s so cute when she started saying those cat breeds haha \"what\\'s the most exciting thing right now?\\n\\n\"grammys!\"\\n\\nthat hits differently in 2020, post Miss Americana 🙁 When she said \"All Too Well because...\" I was like screamingggg. Taytay that\\'s my favorite song. Wished to hear the 25 mins. version someday. I just realised...she’s a normal person. @GehennaGates all 73 Questions are rehearsed, it\\'s not being fake it\\'s being prepared lol Lol . Same TS normal?! take it back. she is a godess! OMG you\\'re right! Except for the fact that she lost track of the number of guitar She literally has a rickshaw in her house, she definitely must be loving south east Asian specially Indian and Bangladeshi culture @Umor Ahmed 5:39 Where is the rickshaw? It’s so visible that she was sad and struggling in this and I’m so happy that now she’s in a better place and that she’s confident and comfortable with herself I really like how she talks. Not really a big fan of her music but her talking is just a mood. She is like that awkward kid who has finally learned how not to be awkward lol I am now over is Tay l am now tim is tay \"What\\'s the coolest thing in this room?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYOU, Taylor ❤️ Vouge interviewer :- what\\'s the COOLEST thing in this place \\nTaylor :- The FIRE PLACE!! \\nWOW! WHAT AN IRONY!😂😂😂❤️ omg hahaha Lets be honest this is not the firstime you watched this😂❤ I just love the way she\\'s dressed in this video. She looks amazing. She is the most real, genuine, and talented artist out there today. \"It was so good that even Jay-Z raved about it.\"\\nDoes Jay-Z normally hate all cake? maybe he\\'s not a cake person. Everyone else famous: has a HUGE mansion\\n\\nTaylor: doesn\\'t\\n\\nStill Taylor: living her best life\\n\\nMe: 😮 @Younjoo Lee ❤❤❤ she has a real estate portfolio of 100million+. shes a rich queen LOL (btw, love your profile pic 😍) She has a 7+ houses and mansion and that\\'s why i love her because she doesn\\'t show off her wealth @c h a n e l o b e r l i n really? So, she has more than one? Wow, that\\'s awesomr. She has got such a calming thing about her aura I feel sad because I feel like I can see her questioning everything she\\'s saying :( That olive tree is probably destroyed 💀💀💀💀 Shut 💀 Her house looks so normal and countryside... I thought it was like a huge mansion and stuff. She has 9 houses Because she is unlike the kardashins;-) She has like 8 mansions at the moment. lol she has multiple mansions around ten US the golden tap got me tho lol Nobody:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaylor: *Says the coolest thing in the room is the fireplace when there’s a fricking GRAMMY right next to her* 😂👏 The dislikes are the people who are jealous that this guy just walks into a celebrities house \"What\\'s the coolest thing in this room\"\\n\"The fireplace\" \\n*Has and award on the table next to her* Never Google yourself again 😂😂 The guy “what is the coolest thing in this room”\\n*literally has a Grammy next to her*\\nTaylor: the fireplace 😂😂😂😂😂🤣 Und so? she\\'s so chill Omg yass lol Annalyse Lockney you’re prettyyyyyy❤️ Her house is literally EVERYTHING. Like- ma’am i want the same. Kim kardashian is Taylor Swift\\'s best enemy.. Satarup Mukherjee Taylor is better *VOGUE PART 2 PLEASEEE...*\\n\\n\\n\\nanyone agree with me? I feel better about my weird elbows now. Thank you. They freak my friends out. Sameeee \"73 questions with the guy who asks 73 questions\"\\nWho else agrees? I literally see this comment on all of these 73 question videos and they are different people 😐 @Mariana Ardila No Russian Doll - = Yes YESS She is beautiful, talented, nice, smart, ect. She is Taylor Swift This guy meets every celebrity but is a celebrity who does not show his face The get a good lawyer hits different after the Sc00ter situation... Mukhtar Osman yes I love that the best compliment she\\'s received is that she\\'s generous. Says alot about her that she values that.being a generous person is far more important  than looks She served water ,welcome him,ask him whether he wants to go out,and said thank you every time he compliment her\\n\\n\\n\\nShe\\'s just so polite man and that natural beauty tho Mary Jane Mahgul Butt yeah but if this comment was towards Selena Gomez or any other artist, everybody would have said : yes you \\'re right. But just because it\\'s Taylor, you say that it\\'s all scripted. It is but I noticed some shyness in her, she\\'s a pure person, you don\\'t have any right to insulte her Mary Jane They dont be nice just because they want to, its all scripted! IzzyLion 33 \\n\\nShe didn\\'t say \"get out\" she said \"get up\" \\n\\nPlus it\\'s all scripted Nadia Goosby its tightly sketched out, but its not scripted word for word When the interviewer asked her how many cat breeds she can breed within 10 seconds is like asking anyone what their favourite song is. Lol Taylor is generous PERIODT “No that was spontaneous, I am a very spontaneous person...” *taylor eyeroll* 😂 She looks amazing here. I love what she\\'s wearing. So classy and sleek and statuesque. I tried to replicate this outfit, and I managed to find the pants she\\'s wearing in this video, but the shirt was sold out! Oh well 😁 “My insecurities” Hits harder after seeing Miss Americana How do I watch Miss Americana? It\\'s off netflix now She said that right after questions about food @Emperor Palpatine lmao J Sharpe lol omg are you talking about your life? Emperor Palpatine shut up rat -.- \"why do you have so many followers?\"\\nbecause my cats are so cute ;) Taylor: “GRAMMY’S!!!” if she knew she was going to meet the gorgeous king of her heart at that gala 😭❤️ \"that karma is real\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkanye west : *chuckle* im in danger After becoming her fan, I learn to start Swift language for ios devices lol 2:04 the answer to this question would be different now. She takes care of herself and eats whatever she wants. Our girl is healthy and happy <3 -Why do you think you are the most followed person on Instagram?\\n-Because my cats are adorable \\n\\nI love her Why people hating on Taylor, she so cool I’m very jealous of the man who gets to interviews all these people! Same But he mostly never gets respect by the interviewees (celeb) Same here Same here Same !!! 😂😂😂 Like here if you want vogue to take this interview again since taylor has changed a lot. -What\\'s your favourite TV show of all time?\\n-Friends\\n\\n-What\\'s one song that you wish you had written?\\n-The friends theme song\\n\\nShe\\'s such a fan Advice for those who want to be Singer: Have a good lawyer. \\nMe: Great my uncle is a really famous amd excellent lawyer. Watching this again in 2020: Understanding what she meant with “Get a good lawyer”. \\n\\nAww Taylor. 🥺 ',\n",

Perhaps they don\\'t chase the ball and bring it back because they enjoy it, but maybe they bring them back because they think WE enjoy throwing them...\\n\\nThink about that next time you doubt a dogs love for man... I would NEVER doubt a dogs love towards a human, it\\'s the other way around pretty sure its natural instinct cause wolfs chase things that move... and usually bring said thing back to the pack pretty sure if you throw a squirrel in a field the dog will go after it and bring it back.... the same way a wolf would\\n\\n\\n\\nnot alive @Amy Franklin Did you enjoy having the dog\\'s company and playing fetch with him? I mean it\\'s a really sweet theory, because that means both parties enjoy it solely because they think the other does. That\\'s adorable. @Jason Alcatraz How does that take guts at all? Death isn\\'t a being, it\\'s just a natural part of life, i do not see the logic behind calling death a \"pussy\". I find it funny that when writing from the perspective of a dog or whatever it\\'s assumed that they don\\'t know how we do things like poop or clean ourselves. Because I had a ferret that not only figured it out, but also tried to mimick me. She figured out that I poop and pee in the toilet, so she started pooping and peeing around the toilet instead of her litter box. I had to put garbage bags down to keep the floor clean. She figured out that I clean myself in the shower, and while she still groomed herself like normal, she\\'d play this game every morning where she\\'d run around the outer edges of the stream of water trying not to get wet. She was never successful. But then I\\'d put a towel down for her afterwards, and she\\'d rub her body on it, and sometimes would even grab an edge with her mouth and roll to wrap herself up in it - basically trying to dry herself like me. She also went from sleeping on top of blankets to sleeping under them with her head (and maybe a paw) sticking out, because that\\'s how I slept.\\nShe was the cutest and sweetest little goober ever :3 Also I will join the ferret revolution if at least one of them have a little hat on I wants a ferret even more now You\\'re speaking in the past tense \\n\\nRIP little ferret Well, ferrets have good hearing if you know what I mean I, for one, welcome our new ferret overlords How have I not seen this delicious video? How the hell is a dog video delicious lmao 😂 You ate dogs!? DELECIOUS? 😳 as i type my dog continues the attempts at finding my leg vagina. HHSSHAHAHAA LOL So did you have leg puppies?😃 and I still wonder what does that even mean... My dog is a female Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahaha How can you dislike something like this its epic 666th like Guys dislikes are likes from Australia, chill out no one can hate this video Right??!! 2800 dislikes?? Really? Lord help them! @BRIAN LASH simvrlasm said cat PEOPLE, nothing but cats @simvlacrvm cats are amazing you shut your hole Dear Diary,\\n\\nDearest human made a smaller made a smaller human. It\\'s like a hairless teddy bear, except it provokes silence and tension wherever it goes.\\n\\nWhen other humans see the small human, they get quiet and stare at it, occasionally taking turns holding it. And when it makes noise, all the humans seem to panic. Like a delicate ritual.\\n\\nI too have to be cautious around this small human because dearest human gets unhappy when I try to communicate with the small human.\\n\\nI now let it do whatever it wants to do, including things to me. This morning it ate my food, and when I ate its food, dearest human was unsettled. It stuck it\\'s hand in my mouth, so I did nothing. This seemed to please dearest human. Aww, this is sad When I was little, I had an all white boxer. One day, my brother and I drew all over him with markers. He just let us do it. I miss him so much. I fear the new puppy will not do well, it has only two legs & no tail.

Dearest human was not happy. Today she has been viewing images of what I can only assume is family of the Hedgehogs, Fluorescent Green Hedgehog. He is coming soon. \\n\\n~Sincerely, my 1 year old Border Collie. Dear diary\\nI like to die\\nThe end @M W. Don\\'t forget Gremlins. Dear Diary,\\nMy dearest human brought me a fluffy rainbow hedgehog this week. Sadly, it squeaks every time I shake it. I’ll continue to shake it in the hopes it will join the other dead hedgehogs in the tiny room of clothing. \\nThis is too much; I don’t pee on the bed. I will lick dearest human’s face in hopes that some day, a squeakless hedgehog arrives. Dear diary,\\nDearest human continues to disapear for extended periods of time. I can only assume its to patrol distant lands for men with hats and beards. It must be an exhausting job as he is less than exstatic when I attempt to sing his praises for embarking on such a crusade.

I think the human is taking the dog cruising IronShocker77,\\nI had a dog who freaked out when she saw me with a towel on my hair. \\nMy current dog doesn’t get confused like that. Maybe it goes back to their wolf genes. Wolves are suspicious of things they don’t understand, like “what’s behind the sofa?” A dog will go around and look. My foster wolf ate the sofa. My dog hates people using hats or beards. I think they don\\'t understand those things and get scared. *Silently laughs HARD in the cubicle* My dog always takes it as an offense if she can’t silence squeaky toys in a few hours, as if it is an insult to her hunting skills that it still lives.

However, today my constipation was very bad. While this video brought great relief, I now have the unfortunate need to change my pants. I will pee on the bed for comfort... Read it in his voice don\\'t quit your day job.

That killed me!! @Christian Chavarria actually, humans have more disgusting mouths than dogs or cats. The bad bacteria and germs in our mouths is hundreds of times more overgrown than in a dog\\'s mouth. Getting bit by a human is far more dangerous. \\nDogs have incredible digestive systems, including their saliva which breaks down the garbage they eat very quickly. @Kitty Quinn True?? I\\'m not sure I would agree but if you think cat poop is delicious candy you\\'re entitled to your perspective. The Caitasaurus  - So true!!! 🤣 Oh right, that makes a lot more sense, I heard \"pea flavoured sprinkles\". I mean, I don\\'t have a cat, but I thought they made pine scented? I was prepared to go with it anyway. At first I was like, \"I don\\'t want to hear a sad story..\" but I watched it anyway and it is.. HILARIOUS!! XD Me too!! XD I am now suspicious of men with hats and beards. My granny told me to never marry a man with a beard bc he might shave one day and be ugly lol this is the single greatest video i have ever seen. Me too Emily Kaplan,\\nTrue Facts about the duck is pretty awesome. I came here wanting to hug the pug in the picture because I pitied him. I ended up roaring with laughter.

Despite all of my efforts I could not escape and had to painfully watch my human enter the place of happiness. Other humans pass by and pity me, yet they do nothing to free me.

Death Rally.  But it\\'s in SPAAAACE! My dog was interested in the squeaking at the beginning That thing in the middle of the back looks like massive USB mini A connection I can think of one great reason to own the mamba: that cockpit in VR. Yamiks, is it possible that FDevs saw Red Line too and that´s where both design and the racing reference come from? Age 40? Jeezus Yamiks, you\\'re a young punk!\\nWait until you hit 50. NO THIS IS POD RACING!!!!! Mabey the middle part is heat depression plate ... Or a spaghetti maker... After all this time, I’m curious to see Yamiks total insurance claim lmao Why does it feel llike the Devs have no idea what they are doing when they release new ships. I\\'m starting to believe when it comes to stats they just roll dice say \"good enough\" and slap the shit in without ever really thinking about WHY they are putting the damn thing in the game other than so no one can say they are ignoring their game “it looks like a guy doing leg day for all eternity” I like the air intakes on the sides towards the front. Two reasons why they could be there:\\n1. For cooling (cars have this for cooling their breaks, performance cars that is) \\n2. For turbines/engines, like jets have them\\n\\nMy point is, they really should think before pushing out designs. They don\\'t have to be 100% realistic and by all means make the ship look cool, but don\\'t put air intakes on a ship in a game where we don\\'t even have  air outside of the ship @Demmrir actually electric motors can generate a lot of heat especially at relatively high speeds for long durations.  Zero motorcycles at the moment have an overheating issue when ridden on the freeway due to the motor overheating and the controller limiting power.  There are some high performance electric vehicles that come with or are going to come with radiators to keep temps down and maintain optimal performance even at high cruising speeds.  \\n\\nFor below freeway speeds though, those grills are generally enough to allow electric motor to passively cool from the air being forced through the bay.  Unless it\\'s a design where the electric motor is in the rear with the battery packs, then it\\'s just a design flare to make it look more like a traditional vehicle.  Electric motors though do suffer from waste heat as well,  and are even more sensitive to temperature fluctuations and waste heat due to the nature of electrical conduction in relation to heat as well as the batteries themselves being fairly temperature sensitive as well. Tell this to electric cars with front grills. People want their intakes so people get their intakes, even if they\\'re literally useless. @Luac Not saying that is the true reason or anything.  Just how I rationalized it.  I know they ARE supposedly trying to make atmospheric landings at some point so it\\'d make sense that nearly all of the ships we have in game that are playable should be capable of atmospheric flight to some extent as well.  Everything but the capital ships really should be planetary capable so long as the gravity isn\\'t too high that it overcomes the ship\\'s thrust to weight ratio. @Talishar i can see that explanation, i don\\'t know too much about the lore, it just felt a bit.. misplaced i guess Story wise, most of these ships are supposed to be atmospheric flight capable, we just don\\'t have that function built into the game yet.  Maybe those intakes open up in atmospheric flight mode to offer much better cooling?  \\n\\nOr maybe it\\'s just because the artist thought it\\'d look cool and has no idea about spaceships or anything else for that matter from an engineering perspective? Yamiks, as an equally-nitpicky aircraft maintainer, some of the nitpicks you have about this ship\\'s design trigger the fuck outta me lol. \\n\\nThe Mamba is designed in a way that is heavily influenced by fighters. Multiple nozzles are there for laminar flow. It\\'s why the part in the aft center isn\\'t an engine. The thruster exhausts are intentionally kept separated to prevent exhaust turbulence. \\n\\nAnd what you call a \"capsule\" is called an injection molded canopy. As you admit, it\\'s designed in such a way that it provides as much visibility as possible. That\\'s why it sits sort of \"on top\" of the ship frame. You couldn\\'t be more wrong about it looking out of place. It\\'s how any fighter style flying craft has been designed since WW2.\\n\\nFurthermore, you ask about the \"trench.\" You joke about it being where the shitter is, but that\\'s literally true in real-world aircraft. That area would have the crew entry ladder to access the ship, the galley, and maybe a simple cot for sleeping. Since the engines and likely equipment bays and other components would stick so far forward in a ship that is all ass, you\\'d have to go down a ladder into the fuselage area of the ship for crew living areas. Otherwise the structure above it would be too weak and thin. Cool It\\'s a good looking ship chassis for sure, even though it\\'s basically the FDL with the center fuselage cut out.  It\\'s performance is a bit lackluster, especially compared to its advertising.  It\\'s no racer though; not when every gutamaya ship can break 800M/S boost--even the CUTTER.\\n\\nIt\\'s like the FDL\\'s hot sister: sleeker, sexier and higher maintenance, but not quite as competent at anything but looking good.  It really should\\'ve been a small ship so it could have enhanced thrusters and compete with gutamaya\\'s speedsters. The Anaconda on that display is actually an over-view of the cockpit. I\\'m really glad I\\'m not the only one that thought that too though lol Remember kids don\\'t do drugs , and you can buy an A rated everything Mamba discounted the cheapest in the galaxy , In the Lembava system the capital system of Li Yong-Rui controlled space. \"Mamaba\" I saw your typo, sneaky Yamiks It outruns fighters, loaded.  I\\'m sure a military-minded person can find a use for that. These two comments make me happy that I spent 150 million kitting one out today It also outguns most larger ships as it can fly out of almost any heavy engagement. People who can\\'t find a niche for this ship shouldn\\'t waste their time trying to think outside of the FDL box. This ship\\'s speed let\\'s you decide when you want to be in combat, you never die as you can just boost away when your shields go down making it tactically better than FDL. Or get the fdl and not need to run away because you\\'re on your targets ass beacuse you can actually maneuver. its less than 5% faster than the FDL fully engineered and around 40% less maneuverable. You couldn\\'t be more wrong. I\\'m gonna name my flaming garbage now Hahahahaha! Hot Shit! They\\'ve always been detachable. It\\'s the re-attachment bit that\\'s eluded us. the thing that inst a thruster, reminds me of a vga port XDDDD Around 5% faster than the fdl and around 40% less maneuverable (both engineered).\\nthe ever so slightly higher dps doesn\\'t matter if you have less time on target. (the anemic vertical thrusters don\\'t help either) \\nand it has weaker shields, which matter MORE because you will have a harder time staying behind your target.\\n*who thought this ship was a good idea?*\\nWhat was the point of the beta if they didn\\'t listen to any feedback?\\n\\nIt flies like a multipurpose ship and has the internal space of a pure combat ship.\\nthis thing is pure garbage. Its clearly more than 5% faster than a fdl lol Manoeuvrability stat is redundant when you boost all the time. The mamba is a beautiful and fast platform for ordnance. Don\\'t like ordnance? Not for you, grab the old boring faceless OP FDL. Redline is an awesome movie! Ive rewatched it quite a few times Space Yacht Space hydroplane That pod racing comment earned my subscription. Because RED GO FAST ( thank ORK logic of warhammer 40k ) Ork Magic To me the mamba looks like a speedy hydroplane, and it\\'s cool af But...but... but... IT\\'S PRETTYYYYYY! RubicksQoob it’s probably one of favorite designs but I like my FDL WAY MORE good design and you pull off amazing (little game breaking) all in one. Talking about racing, I\\'ve always thought the gorge around Felicity\\'s base would work great for races The problem i have with the zorgon flagships both the fdl and the mamba is the lack of internal compartments. I mean, think about this, the krait and python roughly same sized have 8-9 internal compartments. Ok do not give us large ones like class 6 or 5 but at least give us a few more class 3 and 2. Noone said that he would do trading in one of these. With the Mamba..even Paris Hilton says, \"That\\'s Hot!\" Um Britain did take part in ww1. Great video though, keep up the good work. @Gavin Cross ok then, I stand corrected. an93lofdeath he meant the battle of verdun man, i can\\'t wait to win my debut race in my recently bought Mamba Reminded me of the \"Hunter\" from Wing Commander: Privateer. That vent may be a reactor vent.  Also I love the soundtrack of RedLine. I like how we\\'re in the future but we cant paint our ship whatever we want. racin in elite? sign me on, i love your reviews it allways make me laugh... meme ship yeah i guess so Never flying it with FA on. OK noted. Yesterday I buyed my Mamba... 😭😭😭\\n\\nNow I have a Python^^ Hm, \"fine\" addition to my collection Well, thanks to Yamiks I learned that I\\'m an OCD Pilot) I never knew there is a ship called OCD Its a space drag racer. With no other purpose. And no drag strip. I guess in true Space Las Vegas fashion it should now become a drag queen. I\\'ve been trying it out for a few days now and I really like it. I think this is going to be my bounty-hunting / salvage ship. Over 400 kph boost with un-engineered thrusters. Holy cow, this thing is fast. So that\\'s great for getting into AND OUT of tough situations. I\\'m using beam lasers on all the hardpoints except the huge 4x one, where I\\'m using a multi-cannon. The only default item I changed was the shield, which was originally class 4. I swapped it with the class 5 cargo space and upgraded. I love these 😂 glorified x chromosome.\\n\\nactually my least favority ship design, and that\\'s saying something with EVERY imperial ship existing (glorified space dicks, much?) Just looking at this gives me a headache. Reskinning the FDL, arguably the best combat ship aside from vette and conda, then making it worse than the ship it\\'s based on? WTF, FDev? Krait Phantom, Crusader... That was lazy... You can\\'t be excused for this BS, not this time Hey Yamiks, great video! I just applied to the Dead Horse Squadron 2, but I forgot to type anything besides what the default message was. Please approve! I don\\'t wanna miss out on it again! o7 CMDR Darrin Scroyle Mmmmm, crap manoeuvrability tho, just seems like lazy development to me. 4:59 YAY, one two three four. All true. Another wasted opportunity. Bought the Mamba on day one. Spent a couple of hours engineering, took it to a haz res and hated it. Needs a pitch rate buff for a start. Very disappointing. If they buffed the turn rate the mamba would be a good ship. I put g5 dirty drives on it and it still turned like crap. Maybe light weight is the way to go ? Hey, Yamiks, I dunno about you, but that space between the thrusters, looks suspiciously like a glowing serial port, could it be some kind of docking station??? that non-thruster part in the middle of the back looks like an HDMI port I\\'d recommended that it be equipped with a size 7 distributor, but the response on the forums has been lukewarm at best, and outright rejections (it\\'s fine as it is, you\\'ll figure it out, no buff needed, etc) everywhere else.  Size 6 makes sense in the FDL since it needs to save on space, but other ships with similar weapon draw like the Krait are equipped with size 7\\'s.  This would give it greater reserves of power, and let it support more powerful weapon mods to do more damage those few times you have it on target.  It\\'s lack of maneuverability is it\\'s greatest drawback, but I don\\'t think frontier are too keen on changing that. The Krait out performs it anyway. Still, gotta love that look Kanga Roo which is embarrassing since the krait is basically a multi purpose cargo ape. And it beats a ship that is supposed to be a sports car. I just finished engineering my mamba :(\\nKinda like it tho\\nI guess its time to transfer all the modules into my ferde Niikotii FDL for life. Cool ship but you might as well get an FDL since it’s better. I was hopeful Fdevs would release a ship that rivals the fdl for the best PvP ship but neither the mamba nor the krait phantom do. I love my krait really wanted the Phantom to be the fdl killer but as with all new ships, Fdevs continues to disappoint. I really wish Fdevs would actually listen to the community and actually play their own game @R G - https://coriolis.io/outfit/krait_mkii?code=A4pktkFfliduspf52b1e2b2g2a04040300B1fm2d2d5dm52t6b.Iw18WQ%3D%3D.MwBj5BGboJlskEgcYQ%3D%3D.H4sIAAAAAAAAA42SO0sDURCFJ%2BZh3uuuSUyIweiuBlKEFDY2YiOKiAREbBW0EQsLrcRCEGsRsbJI4Q%2Bw0x%2FgD7CwsLCwDKJWIsHHjHOCuUQh4BaHw853z9x75xKHiOgrqPJ5rBK7CBAl4ixir6tzDh5FvPEwkfh40pB7KuHah4j1UCHKYI1z06tQD2cMtK1iee8iqSeVdN0iyoJ0twaU9HPekLsgb6s%2FIal7%2FenOvopIkCcMtK8SwcaiJzbRMNwI3CjcGJyEeLWNO30logpCcvMFLYV50SRBgisRotDmi0h26lnEPWpouwgvGwjnKNeQdBXTjWNPOWRKtCMp3y0pxkttiLAqAHFw8CyOWGj4NSne0W6tW7sETxvoDPeEklPdUehaGw%2FdJRVK8swvKHauU7UwIBuuRXpwYvOCITcQh7HYIL3WWPq5bOqnSLpUmywOKgTnAPfgJPVvMs1zIP0gD1V89Td9OXgZrcsoFbXiNpt6bUJ%2Fv28ctoYRoAIAAA%3D%3D.EweloBhBmSQUwIYHMA28QgIwVyKBQA%3D%3D&bn=%5BDRTY%5D%20Albino%20Rhino\\n\\nThe key is to stay evasive. Also, Commanders hate missiles, but they\\'re no rules in war. Keep the Pulse Laser firing on them for continous DPS and when their shields go down it\\'ll be a helluva time for them if they\\'re up close. *Incoming Missile* and *Malfunction, Malfunction* is all their going to hear. I\\'ve won enough fights with this build to know it works, but it\\'s not unbeatable. Also, it smashes the Meta. Rinzler o7o7o7 would like to disagree. @The Thumbinator lay that build on me, I\\'m a new commander who recently got the Krait MK II. I\\'m just using a basic pulse and multicannon place holder build the at moment @MatchBreakers - I agree, creating a new, better OP ship will do nothing, but cause a new Meta and we\\'ll be in the same boat as we are now. All ships should have their advantages and disadvantages. Sure, the FDL is amazing, but it can just as easily be beaten. Even the Mamba has potential in the right hands. Advantage is it\\'s speed with it\\'s small (very small) Disadvantage is lower manuverability. Killing off all the existing PvP ships with something just better is a slippery slope, making every new thing just more and more outclassing the previous. Finding the slots for the  new ships amongst the new ships instead of above them is the right choice, Fdev just do not do it very well. wonder if he\\'s any relation of Red Dwarf\\'s Olaf Peterson.... would explain alot I like it... It compensates for my lack of flying ability with speed. It has a perfectly designed Fighter cockpit! three words\\n\"Boom \\'n Zoom\" I was waiting for this. Love Your vids and I know You\\'re apolitical in every way but please look for the alternative to patroen. They ban people for no reason against their very own rules, while making up nonsensical excuses. Many people are jumping the ship. Please consider alternatives. You are probably loosing subscribers right now for that very reason. Finally! Mamba\\'s canopy should have been placed waaaay back, next to where the engines are starting to poke out on top...\\nAnd a bit higher too.\\nThis would\\'ve give the ship a luxury yacht vibe, also, i\\'d personally prefer less toxic color scheme when they first anounced Mamba and Phantom i was hypeed for mamba but in the end its gonna be phantom that will be added to my fleet You have to try it before give it up 2:22 ah, I see you are a man of culture as well I sidewinder bombed myself back to the bubble to pick up one of these got it to 37.5 ly,s and headed back to colonia, got a lot of amazing photos on the way. Id say it was worth it to have it out here. 2:58 heat vent? Ya\\'ll know how RGB lighting makes your pc 50% faster? And buying skins in several games makes you a better player? Well, you can compare the existence of the Mamba with the philosophy of these type of things. i dont care i still love it and an A rated mamba is perfectly capable of fighting so myehhhh Well I wasn\\'t expecting that at the start, now to clean up the tea spill.... I second that: If you didn\\'t see Redline, absolutely DO IT. Little red Corvette\\r\\nBaby you\\'re much too fast\\r\\nLittle red Corvette\\r\\nYou need a love that\\'s gonna last Ohh sweet! A new ship butchering, *grabs coffee*, hit play, *drops coffe in knee*. I was NOT prepared for that voice! :D :D Even though they added so many ships since I started playing it is pointless. Aside from Chieftain as intermediate the  old ship progression didn\\'t change. If they had a proper trade off it would be fine but frankly they are just worse. mount some frag cannons and you go have yourself a merry day with the best space shotgun in the galaxy Yeah, I\\'m old the ship looks like an A wing with big wings strapped on the sides i\\'m so happy that i bought the  Krait Phantom instead i can\\'t boost but i can jumper futher  for exploration Wait, you still believe in Frontier?  LMAO. Your data is outdated, heat issues got fixed as far as i can tell and here is one big idea what the ship is:\\nThe ultimate speedbomber, designed to zoom in unleash the full ordnance load to get the kill and run for rearming.\\nNo other ship features the speed necessary for that task, with a high heat dissipation rate comparable to the mamba.\\n2 large torp tubes and twin disruption mines are nothing to sneeze at, backed up with one huge tool for the finishing blow. Dude, the fucking orca is faster than this pos @aCRAZEDgunman The reason i love it as a hit and run ship is the setup, especially with huge ordnance being in the game. The FDL can carry 8 torpedos on the mediums in comparison and a huge gun. The mamba has 8 torps and 2 mine or missile launcher and a huge gun as backup. The hardpoints make that difference. It is not just looking at DPS, sometimes tools are better than DPS. @Julio Montega Well it just does not make sense how having 50 m/s and half of a small hardpoint over a fer de lance suddenly turns it into a hit and run god. Like how people were telling me how okay the chieftain is at pvp, but the how the challenger is the shit. It is even more confusing when people tell me that their fer de is faster than their mamba with the same build. It seems good just not great. @kofeyh What you call a requirement to fitting here, i call flavour and quirks. Something that makes the mamba outstanding as it has character. Multirole ships spoil too many folks, If it is not for you, well no sweat flying it. @Julio Montega I am no \"meta guy\". Personally I like flying the mamba but when you are required to outfit to solve its inherent poor design which is seldom exampled elsewhere (neither imperial or federal ships cook as much and both run hot) and it is not the least bit incongruous. I am all for choice and selection, but not via arbitrary choice to not offer actual competiton to the FDL. glad you mentioned redline. i thought the same thing. Thanks for the tip Yamiks. Just watched Redline. And in original Japanese, no sh*tty English dubbing. It is pretty hard to describe that anime with few words... Weird as fuck would be one!\\n\\nBut then again, I have not watched new anime in ages, after starting my movie hoarding around 20 years ago.\\nRedline is like a love child of Cowboy Bebop and Fist of the North Star. But sadly, without a soundtrack of Yoko Kanno.\\n\\nAnd Mamba? Well, I bought that as well to replace my engineered Crusader as my personal Bubble jumper.\\nIt has gotten better after your review and is gorgeous as usual!\\nDetails around the cockpit are INSANE. But yes, that trench is like WTF? a faster ship can dictate engagements, zoom in, boom enemy in the face, zoom outside the enemies range, turn and repeat. a helicopter can turn on a dime, but do you think that helps against a jet in a fight? nope Good thing I was awake early today.   Thanks Yamiks The point of this ship speed is to to hit and run to recover shields Frontier up to the usual ship shenanigans. No clue how up make unique builds. Fer-de-lance: who are you?\\nMamba: I am you but faster. what about the large hardpoint placement?! Did anyone ever tell you that your use of the english language sounds increasingly more British? It also starts sounding more archaic. Not criticism though, just a neutral fact. It\\'s a hydroplane. In space. They go fast in a straight line too. Also dont turn. And have a habit of spontaneous combustion outside of the engine. It was too much shake and bake in beta, and it\\'s still a solution looking for a problem now. It looks great, tho. It really does. If only it flew as good as it looked. The thing in the middle is the HDMI port! ',\n",

It\\'s really much harder than it looks !!!! :) You look like tom cruise :) Hi Daniel, Marco here. I love your content, I always refer to it when I have to learn new movements.\\nUnfortunately there is no such quality video in italian, you should think about exporting your knowledge in other languages to spread consciousness throughout the world.\\nLet me know if I could help in that direction.\\nGreetings! Toilet paper. You will be lucky mate! Actually, the chest and abs are the easiest body part to train at home... I\\'d rather you released exercises targeting every other muscle grups. How much should i rest between the sets? Is it a circuit workout ? @Len J Actually it does not differ from rests that you use for other muscles, you give 1-3 min rest, if you can perform well enough give yourself closer to 1 min rest, if you are getting really tired the go to 2-3 min rest, those exercises might seem easy, but they are not, take your time to recover, especially your breath Good question - does anyone know? I suspect short rests and keep going as a circuit is what he meant Some will have no problem finding toilet rolls! I laughed out loud when he mentioned it!🥴😄 Guys imma call it the \"almost dead bug\" cause the real \"dead bug\" would be hollow body hold haha 1.000.000 Subscribers!\\nCongratulations Daniel! 🎉 Don\\'t mind me! Just leaving a comment to help the Channel. thank you for giving sugestion about reps and sets, many ytbers fail to mention this Hello there, may you please ask me on one question, so, I was doing a lot of pull ups ,like really lot of every single day for 2 weeks and I was not aware of possible consequences. One day during my workout( I am  barely19 years old , 185 cm and 72kg) , I felt a bit sharp pain in my middle to upper back, middle the most, and I didnt take it seriously so I continued for a bit and the same day in the evening I was doing 5x per 5 seconds  exercise hold known as L sit. And during that I again felt sharp pain but this time much stronger and sharper  and I handled the pain for 5 more seconds and I was done with my mini workout routine. After one week of strong sharp pain that occurs while taking deep breaths and coughs and bending my body,throwing something with hand and on sudden moves  and lowering my body down to try to touch my foots I went to psychotherapist and he gave me deep and painful massage and said that I have probably pulled some of my back muscles and he told me it will go away during 10 days max. , one week has passed away and it didnt go away at all and I consulted a bit with my father(I have divorced parents so  he didnt know) who has recently finished 3 month massage course he told me it is probably little muscle rupture and the WORST thing that I can possibly do is go and take deep massage even tho psychotherapist on first look treated me with deep massage, so I stopped visiting him! But he told me to not train and to have minimal little physical activity which I did,just like bicycling. After 2 more week I went to orthopedist and when I came there , he was touching and checking my back for any pain but I wasnt feeling anything at all because I came relaxed and without any activity.(When I warm up or run for 50 meters,after that I will feel pain during some regular moves at which I dont usually feel anything).He told that it may be pulled muscle,muscle rupture and also told me that it will go away for 2-3  weeks. I waited again. It can last from 1-6 weeks he says , depending on severity of injury. Now that has passed away and now since my first day when I got sudden pain already 2 months has passed away, it happened in start of February and now its April , exactly 2 months and I still have injury, I dont feel any pain at all and I can run like few minutes I think and do all daily activities and everything normally but yesterday i was just shooting ball with leg , like playing football 15 minutes in my garden  even without running, with my friend ,and when I came home that day I was feeling slight pain during deep breaths and faster walking again,so the injury isnt healed yet, after 2 months succh easy  activity managed to hurt me(wow), so I am thinking like have I complete muscle  rupture since everyone says grade one lasts for 1-2 weeks grade 2 lasts 1-6 weeks and grade 3( complete breakdown-rupture)  can take few months and now I am slowly starting my 3rd month(first day of 3rd month). The problem is I do not know is it muscle or tendon, thats huge. And If its muscle I dont know is it trapezius , lattisimus dorsi, or is it maybe infraspinae or is it tendon!!. Now because corona I cant go to X ray so I can 100% know whats going on and 2 months is long period  and I am still not 100% pain free, I know after I become pain free I still should not train for 2 more months and let it fully heal and recover, but can my muscle or tendon heal on its own beccause I do not know the severity of injury but it still lasts and since I have it for 2 months thats some serious injury . When I google some pictures my pain point is exactly on place where trapezius is beginning and latisimus  as well so I cant figure out which one, Its under my blade , on the middle of body(width),so under shoulder blade and then closer to spine. I wish I can email you to draw on internet pictures the exact point since I am desperate to find out whats going on. Can you somehow possibly answer me is it trapesius or latisimus  or something else or tendon, or even intercostal muscle because it perfectly describes sharp pain during deep breath and during cough, sneeze , but pull ups cant cause it so... Now and already last 2 weeks I am pain free but as soon as I do some mini activity for 10 minutes after that I will a little bit experince a bit of pain until evening. I dont know is surgical operation or rehabilitation program necessary. ( muscle pull, tear or rupture and is it trap or lats or something else, or is it tendon and is it complete rupture or no ? I cant aswer those question no matter how much researches I do and spend time on internet. I know this is huge message :( , somehow try to help me , Corona doesnt let me go anywhere. I am writing you  from Croatia by the way... I m waiting for the chest exercises 🤟 @Isyankar 47 what ups? Looking forward to that too Ever heard of push ups? there are quite many chest workout video in his channel Super 👍🏻❤️ continue perfect series Great exercises, most of them are also really good to fix my bad posture and flared ribs so thanks! The bird dog is funny when you first doing that. Your ass aiming everywhere.🤣 Hello!\\nWhat shoes are you wearing? Realy realy like the way they look :) Maybe  New Balance Minimus 20v7 Trainer So good. Let\\'s start the workout with my weaknesses. Lol If only i had found this 10 minutes ago when i was working out Hey, I always get lower back pain on my left side when doing the side plank on my left side. Right side is no problem. Could this be due to incorrect form or could my left side be weaker? Thank you for putting this awesome workout together for us.  Since they closed the gym, I\\'ve been feeling quite anxious.  These exercises help a lot.  Love & light. Thanks Daniel this is really helpful Hi, great video! Should this workout be done in a circuit or in reps and sets method? Congrats on 1 million subs Daniel!!!! Been your supporter for 6 or so years. Keep doing what you\\'re doing Congratz on 1mil. Daniel, i\\'m here since few thousand subs!!! 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊 More at home content this is gold Hey Daniel can u do a video on improving grip strength Thank you for this video, I was looking for an actual routine to follow to strengthen my core on my rest days! You delivered : D By the way do you have a specific rest time between sets? Love your videos and your knowledge! Daniel, can you please make an informative video on unilateral training? Not on it’s benefits or progressions to build up to it, but why it’s progressions are very limited and why you favor bilateral movements more. For example, I’ve gotten to the point where I can do archer ring push-ups, archer ring dips, one arm push-ups, and archer ring rows and now I’ve moved back to the basics doing them weighted to better be able to measure strength gain. Can you please discuss why you favor bilateral training, why unilateral training has limited options for progressions, and if strength on unilateral movements is maintained/strengthened when resorting back to doing the basics weighted? 3:19 people will finally find a usage for all the toilet paper they have bought Im trying to achieve the dragon flag, will this help me if I add them to my workout? Yes this will give you the base level core to do the progressions to dragon flag Thanks for sharing the workout. What would you suggest as a replacement/progression for the last exercise? Thanks a bunch for the improvement in quality for this video compared to the last one. I\\'ll be sharing this one around for sure ✊great break down Wow! These workouts are harder than they look 😉👍🏽 Magnifique as always! Love from India bro, I found your channel today and now I am a follower 1:37 Oh I am checking you out alright As usually, top quality video! Please also expand thoughts on your nutrition. It is very difficult to achieve the physic like yours without proper diet. Best regards! 1.000.000 subscribers - congrats! Keep up the awesome work! Congrats for the million subscribers! what rest time between sets would you recommend? How often I should train abs ? Love it!!!! Guess I can\\'t do the dead bug. No toilet paper. Looking amazing guy..😀🌈🙏😁 I was working out at a local park here in Florida and a guy asked me where he could get a set of TRX straps,I told him,and he said he looked everywhere trying to purchase any free weights (including dumbbells), but said that there were none available at all. It\\'s nice to hear of people improvising. Keep moving forward ! Most excellent video, as usual! Hi Daniel.  Great workout and I\\'ll add that into my new block that I just started this week.  I\\'m just interested to know if that was your own full ROM on the bird dog or if you do have a bit more shoulder mobility?  If you have more mobility did you cut it back intentionally?  It just looked like the arm could go a little higher to create a straighter line with the spine and leg.  Interested in your opinion on best form.  Cheers champ. 🔥🌶️ I just got recommended to your channel, can\\'t wait to try out this exercise, I want to get a stronger core and flat stomach so I\\'m really excited for this, thanks! @Borjan Koprivnjak are you trolling? daniel is 10 superior to Chris in every aspect... The amount of nonsense spread by Chris is staggering exercisesJust visit chris heria channel and thats all he is the best for abs e Which is more scarce: 1:TP or 2:weights? whatsstandard TP for sure Great training!! What are the rest intervals between sets?  How many times per week should we use this specific workout? @Dimitris Antoniadis alright thanks @owen Lim honestly whatever you prefer dude. You could do every exercise with short rest in between (30 sec) than repeat for let\\'s say 3 rounds an rest 1-2 minutes between the rounds. Otherwise, you could do 3 sets of an exercise and then move to another while resting 45 secs to 1 minute between every set. It depends on what you feel your body responds better to or which one you simply prefer. @Dimitris Antoniadis How long should the rest between each set be? Do i do 3 sets of plank before moving to another exercise or I do 1 set of each exercise before doing another set? Rest time should be based on what your body tells you, but since this is an abs hypertrophy workout I\\'d say 0:45 to 1:30 minute depending on your level. You should do it 2-3 times a week for maximum results and make sure to rest at least 48 hours between each session. Daniel can you do a video where you cover ALL the Ab exercises YOU SHOULD NOT DO? @fitnessFAQs daniel can you plz do a video about cervical  spine exercises Sir can you make a video on cool down and how to improve muscle soreness How do you correct muscle imbalancies, especially back muscles? Could you make a video about on this topic? can you pls manke a video on how to strenghenth the elbow pls Awesome! ✌🏼😎👍🏼 Every other day or everyday for this workout ? Are barbers still open?\\nHow did you get a haircut? :) @chris toey uhmmm...nope they re not...they\\'re not supposed to be anyways...in Italy they re not open...

Plz tell me in simple english I am waiting your reply Boys: Watches entire video\\n\\nGirls: 5:03 👍🏽 TheNorman That front lever plank is something else, never felt my lower \\nabs like that! It is because you have to squeeze them in their longest position. The harder you push down the greater the stretch on ur upper quad tendon. Squeeze the ass together evenly and push the hips forward and down it is amazing. toilet paper everywhere except in the market... 😅 do you recommend side rises instead of side plank? Toilet-Paper-Joke. :D why? :( what do you think of weighted abs training in the gym. Like weighted flexion, and weighted leg raises and reverse crunches? Do you think that is needed? who else tried to get fit during the PANDEMIC AND JUST GAVE UP.\\nAND then u saw this vid and GOT BACK YOUR MOTIVATION.\\n100000 THANKS TO THIS MAN Close to 1 million brooooo Dumbbells are more common and available than toilet paper these days.🤣 Does this work the obliques aswell?

That point is for the experts (that I am not). At our level what we need to do, I told you, I follow it strictly & almost my whole city (Hyderabad). There was lot of travel by air here & they spread it. Now thousands of migrant workers (from their homes a thousand kilometers away) who need to earn for their needs & now without work are the reason. They set out traveling on foot(as all means of transport got banned). They are the hot-spot wherever they are. Mostly the government & some charitable organisations feed them whenever they see them. The picture here is that.

Just talk to his manager Michael Moore sucks to suck but I am a pineapple From my limited experience, living in N Nigeria, I see some validity in your theory. Nigeria is so rich in resources, including oil, gas, agriculture and minerals. But, there are really 2 Nigerias. First, there is the north, which is arid, Muslim and home to several tribes, but mostly the Hausa and Fulani. The south is more lush, humid, partially coastal, Christian and dominated by Igbos and Yorubas. They have a general distrust of each other, which stems from the Biafra civil war. From my understanding, the boarders were decided by the British. @boy Afrika and answer the question. Is it okay for me to class non white people as not british, if you can class white people as not african? Your silence on the subject is deafening @boy Afrika yes you norbert. The romans, saxons, vikings, french, did it to the english and everyone else they invaded and colonized. It happens to everybody. Get over it. Why didn\\'t your ancestors fight us off if they didn\\'t want to be colonized? @Daniel Ball did non British people in murder people and took over the land? Same goes for Australia and the so called United states @Connor Broderick the whole of  africa has gone to shit since we handed it back to the natives. Everything they touch turns to shit @Frankondor every nation has had slaves, and been slaves. The slaves we took from africa were sold to us by africans, and the arabs were doing it hundreds of years before us. But why dont you complain about them? Could it be that you have an agenda against the white man. Jealous of the white man\\'s success i am guessing. Your problem is racism towards the white man. Theres a reason that africa is 50% muslim - because arabs conquered you too. But you dont mind that as they aren\\'t white. Stop feeling sorry for yourselves, and get a grip. Romans, saxons, vikings, the french. Just 4 off the top of my head that conquered and enslaved the british - yet it never held us back, and we aren\\'t still crying about it and asking them for reparations either. Perhaps your ancestors should have fought harder if they didnt want to be conquered and wanted to make their own borders You missed two key geographical characteristics of Africa that impacted the peoples there.  The lack of navigable rivers deep into the heartland, and the lack of deepwater sea ports.  Cheers, Russ Also no natural harbors. Cold environments may help create gratification deferment in the population but subsaharan africa is tropical. @John Brodrick same with you too. I have no point in having a conversation with you. Just waiting my time. @Mario None Lol. It\\'s obvious there\\'s no point in having a conversation with you. @John Brodrick that is wheat, not rice. @Mario None African Rice (Oryza glaberrima) has been domesticated in Africa for over 3,000 years. Get YOUR facts straight before telling others to get theirs right. I though i would find more \"triggered\" comments here but i\\'m actually surprised at the level of intelligent debate going on in the comments. And for that, i will give it a \"Like\". Very interesting video. Help I\\'m A Rock IQ has nothing to do with ethnicity, just circumstances. If the circumstances are right a black kid will do better than a white kid that doesn’t have the same circumstances Help I\\'m A Rock it is a great Excuse. It’s even backed up. Civilization land that flourish have better geography simple. Learn new things every day Translation: the video makes excuses for black people, so I like it. @Petrus 906 you mean the undisputed facts about IQ?  That science? Hitori Bocchi the video attracts the “better” (however you judge goodness of a comment by) comments. If the comments suit you, the video should, in theory, suit you. If the comments contain angry people debating the video, the in theory, probably isn’t the best explainer of whatever subject. I think its an okay system to judge videos on, but watch the video and just see if it suits you is probably the better way Also, a lot of Africa is landlocked, and the rivers are not very good for transporting goods. Also, Africa is bloody huge. @jaecee - Well it depends on what you mean by superior.  Different races do some things better than those of other races.   Even intra-racially.  West Africans are superior at short distance sprinting versus others, East Africans are superior at long distance marathons over others!  You pick various things you value, and that will determine which one is the superior race for you, but as for actually who is superior no matter who is looking at the situation, I don\\'t think science has made any decision on it because that doesn\\'t exist. @Stonemansteve II  europeans had geographical advantages that asia and especially africa had. it was way easier for europeans to learn, collaborate, and share ideas then africans. its like this: put 5 guys in a room to come up with an idea vs 2 guys, whose gonna come up with a good one first? the 5 guys. they also had the convenience of the various rivers and other routes in which they interacted with each other. africa, not so much. it has very little to do with \"skin coloring\" and more to do with topography, geography, and climate. while I agree that europe has had some of the greatest minds and cultural products, it is not a superior race. racial superiority does not exist. @Noname yep @Michael McCabe Land was also ideal for raising horses. The levels of corruption in African governments is amazing Africa and corruption??? TRUMP hold my beer..... @Giovanni Acuto \"mixture of Greeks and Arabs in the South\" you\\'re so wrong about that. @Giovanni Acuto Right, it is strength for Jeff Bezos for example @Q Anon To me, diversity is neutral. How you use it decides whether it can be a strength or a weakness @Giovanni Acuto Diversity is not a strength* I\\'m African and I\\'ve had this belief since 2005 when I visited Europe. I thought it was just me. It\\'s common sense to deduce when you study the climate and location of the continents Blac O Cloc yeah I know that but who suffered it MORE yup black people. Sure every FUCKING race suffered slavery but did they for fucking 400 years @Anime battles battle Royale Get over it. Africans aren\\'t the only ones who suffered slavery. Go study your history. Even the people who colonized you were once victims too. Don\\'t  blame race for human nature. @Anime battles battle Royale like every other afro-invention, that shit is debunked. Help I\\'m A Rock I’m not trying to play the victim card, but I’ll have too. YOU are acting live we weren’t deprived of our human rights force to work under white people and were segregated, this infact already caused many damages. Not allowed to learn how to read because the whites feared we would be smarter than them. Honestly it’s like you can’t understand that “circumstances” make us who we are @Anime battles battle Royale so you\\'re saying black people as a whole prosper in places like the United States?  They aren\\'t poor and lacking?\\n\\nthat\\'s news to me. The frozen winter put cultures in the Northern Hemisphere into a project management cycle of continuous improvement. @dernwine Except squirrels do that by instinct, not IQ.  Put them somewhere else and they won\\'t be able to think of a solution.  They will just keep looking for acorns.  Beavers aren\\'t master engineers either.  They just pile sticks on the sound of running water.  They will pile sticks on a speaker playing the sound of running water. Up to about ten thousand years ago, the Sahara was a lushed tropical forest. Scientists are still trying to piece together a climate and ecological model for that period. Once we have enough data to support a climate model, we\\'ll be able to conceive some plausible scenarios for the rise of the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.\\nIt seems that the more we discover about the pyramid building era, the less ground we have to explain them. I wonder how humanity would react to the conclusion that the birth of human civilisation has to be extraterrestrial in origin. but much of africa is arid desert with drought seasons where it gets worse, if anything they advanced less because less rescourses valuable metals and gems arent useful if oyu dont have the rescources to progress to that point. where as in the north yes there was the winter but was other wise quite abundant in things like wood and game. wich helps. Also the cold just kind of pushed the far north to raid due to poor farming also milk genetics so we could use cows better who could eat grass and stuff.\\nBut also like a large part of western civ is just borrowed from the romans conquering north Europe as before they were a more tribal based society before hand and rome introuce a lot of new ideas in addition to genociding and enslaving the north europeans @Chad Vader Not true Greeks and Romans are a counter example to that. The cold only pushed people to raid just like the Vikings did Confort breads weakness while hardship hardens people.\\nIf you evolve in a place where everytihng is there for you to take all year round the only thing you need to worry about is competition with other humans, hence you evolve agresion.\\nIf you evolve in a place where foreign people are rare and you are most likely to die to nature you evolve cooperation and planning to fight the elements.

Best regards, I\\'m going to enjoy the rest of your clip. Good work Jargons can suck my dick. This isn\\'t science, his usage fits the colloquial English definition of theory. \"I hope I didn\\'t step on too many toes\"... Sad when someone feels like they feel will be persecuted for expressing an opinion using only facts. Jared Diamond made the same argument in \"Guns, Germs and Steel.\" This theory is right. If african geography were different(lets say), then great civilizations would develop there\\nAnd, thinking about this, this happened in the Americas too. We see, the inca empire develop in the same climate(andes mountain), the same goes to the aztecs(mexican highlands). In other places in this continent, the climate were more diverse, and so was the tribes. Makes sense, doesnt it? They didn\\'t have access to Vibranium. Anime battles battle Royale slavery was a long time ago.  Besides that, it doesn’t explain why EVERY black community is failing, regardless of slavery or not, regardless of Jim Crow or not, regardless of colonialism or not. \\n\\nMy hypothesis is so much easier to explain, don’t you think? Help I\\'m A Rock Ofc people don’t. We cause our own inferiority complexes. I mean imagine if you were enslave lmaoo do you think people would value you. And no black people (today) aren’t a huge victim everyone has their problems(even white people) Anime battles battle Royale by the way I hope you don’t support black lives matter or any of the many many organizations or figure heads like Oprah and Lebron who shove it down everyone’s throat that black people are oppressed. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t be oppressed and successful  at the same time. Anime battles battle Royale so there is a worldwide conspiracy to keep them down for no reason at all eh?  That’s your conclusion?  People just hate the color black? Help I\\'m A Rock not really also. Since trauma from whatever “slavery” they felt could probably make them not perform well in society. Secondly bias. Literal ya black “might” not get a job not because he’s incompetent but because he BLACK. But technically that’s not society, just companies that are racist. I guess companies are also part of society. All I’m saying is that black people are “oppressed”(lightly) but not like the past Atlas Pro: \"correlation does equal causation.\"\\n\\n\\nScientists: \"Uhmm....nah, G.\" @AWESOMEBMBHCoCMESTR Plunder here\\'s an experiment for ya....Africans have moved all over the world into different \"climates\" and still continue to remain poor.  No matter where you go in the world, their communities are poor.\\nSo now we know it\\'s not the climate. @AWESOMEBMBHCoCMESTR Plunder  In the social and historical sciences we have to rely on the universe to provide the \"experiments\", so it\\'s less precise, but with enough examples you can still make some rigorous claims. The weakness of this theory actually lies in the counter- example. We\\'ve got 3 or 4 examples of vertical zones, but only one horizontal. The only way to prove causation is with an experiment. So, please do conduct an experiment concerning entire continents and thousands of years of human development. I have the feeling most \"scientists\" are also unaware of the difference. Or it\\'s probably the stupid mainstream media which presents everything in such a distorted way 3:03 laughs in 23 Indian languages Yeah whats up with that? Its got me wondering if the whole of india was lumped together because of the geographical barrier of the mountains Every thing was peaceful until the different climate zone attacked. 5:24 REALLY?? \"Europeans were FORCED\" so that\\'s what you have to say about colonizing Africa? k.... I mean... Weren\\'t they? It doesn\\'t justify colonialism of course, but it\\'s a fact that Europe needed more resoruces to fuel their industrialization. OMG really, i always thought about some of those aspects being the reason for the problems of the African Continent (beyond the colonialism). Obviously the theory is way more complete than my thoughts, but that\\'s cool. I want to life there actually, I have been thinking of moving there @Roze Wolken why would you wanna settle there ...why? If anyone wants to go to Africa i recommend you to go to Ethiopia its so beautiful btw im from Hungary @Charles Black i hope that\\'s a joke lol I\\'m sure there is a mud hut just waiting for you. The concept of geography determining a country\\'s advancement or stagnation is covered very deeply in \\'Guns, Germs and Steel\\', by Jarrod Diamond.\\n\\n The reason Africa has been held back, is indeed because of geography. They had virtually no plants nor animals that were capable of domestication, thus there was never an abundance or oversupply of food to allow them to sit around and solve social problems. They remained tribal and therefore did not advance.\\n\\n South America was similar although there was some degree of advancement there and some very large cities were built.\\n But none of them could compete with what was available in the Fertile Crescent and that\\'s why civilisations started there. \\n It was also in the Fertile Crescent where the single most important invention that helped the advancement of civilisation was made.\\nWRITING.\\n Writing was invented in Sumer where the Sumerians lived in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\\n\\nThe idea that Africa failed because it was taller than its width is ridiculous.\\n Australia is much wider than it is tall and there was no civilisation there. The reason being the same as Africa, no animals or crops able to be domesticated to supply an over abundance of food. @Ken Lyneham I think Shepper meant that they couldn\\'t build higher civilizations like the Roman Empire. Water is a common factor if you look at all the world\\'s greatest civilizations i.e. Egypt, China, Rome, etc. because it gives you access to agricultural benefits, navigation, exploration, and many more things @shepper \\nYou obviously know little about Australian Aborigines.\\nThere were about 300+ different languages and many of them traded with the other.\\n Northern Aborigines traded with and married different ethnic groups from the Indonesian islands.\\n Some Aboriginal groups built stone houses, probably before your equally old ancestors.\\n Other groups practiced aquaculture.\\n Some synonyms of \\'civilization;\\nculture · customs · mores · way of life · attainments · achievements · society · nation · people · community,\\n all of which Australian Aborigines had. Australia was separated by sea from the rest of the Eurasian continent, basically from the arrival of aboriginals to European colonization the humans in Australia have 0 contact with the rest of Humanity\\n\\nNo trade = No civilization One of my favorite books! I have wondered about this my whole life and you just summerised it in one short video. I have no idea how you researched this, but man what a good job. Thank you Seems like a-frican nightmare 👹 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Lmao Hey dad you can’t back from the store! *BA DUM TISH!* Having lived in Africa (from East to South Africa) for 31 years, I found your expose very interesting. However I would look also at the Bantu (iron workers from Nigeria/Camerun area) migrations of the years 1000 AD and the second one around 1500 AD; these may make your views even more interesting. Geography teacher: As you can clearly see on the map which is a Mercator projection of the Earth that Eurasia, a continent which on the north is very close to the North Pole, is wider than it is tall; and Africa, a continent that has the Equator piercing through it on this Mercator projection map, is clearly taller than it\\'s wide.\\n\\nMe: Imma head out just explain nothing xD One word when I went in to the video:\\nSAHARA Patrick Star: Why don\\'t we take Africa and push it somewhere else? they did.  The USA.\\nSpoiler: it didn\\'t work out. Read \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\". @Use Bitchute i remember reading in my history book about how corn improved, almost saved sub saharan africa. @Felipe Carvalho Let\\'s see whether it would be possible to link to competitor:\\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/video/qvaxPH3ftUQ/\\n[hope it works] @Felipe CarvalhoTLDR key arguments:\\n1) Wheat has inferior crop yields to potato/corn or rice\\n2) Zebras were actually tameable when in XIXth century colonisers bothered to try, no good reason to think that wild horses were any nicer.\\n3) Claim that all domesticated animals were specially friendly is contradicted by historical records describing auroch as the total opposite of that.\\n4) Claim that limiting factor for animal domestication was their availability is contradicted by Russians recently domesticating foxes.\\n5) Actual studies concerning spread of corn in Americas contradict claims that there was any real issue with moving plant on north-south axis.\\n\\nActual video got self-censored. As posts to other video platforms get often shadowbanned, I suggest to google for “jared diamond alt hype”. Watching it was quite surreal as the author is rather rude and politically radical, but nevertheless when filter out the arguments are logical and mainstream science. If you are unable to stand that person, just follow his links to the original studies.\\n\\nPlease post later your opinion, I’m curious. @Use Bitchute please could you say further about those criticisms, or maybe provide some link to them? Would love to read it. I used to treat it very seriously. Later, when I was watching a rebuttal I was even embarrassed that I actually knew that wheat was inferior to potato/corn or rice, which according to theory should have doomed Europeans. 4:46 from north africa lol Sounds like a plausible theory. I also find it very interesting. Thank you 🙏🏾 sooo much for this vid bro if only my ancestors could’ve united😔 they would have saved our resources, our history, and their lives 😒 but nahhh Interesting observation. Some other reasons: The lack of fast growing straight trees that can be used to build ships with. The lack of a cold sterilizing winter that kills off many disease carrying insects. @Clement Osei Tano https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf      This is just science.  Sorry if it upsets you but you\\'ll get over it. @George East Yours were debunked before you were even born!! Uneducated, white supremacist BS. LMAO 🤣 @Admire Kashiri Thank you. These fake historians on here are hilarious! @HaiLsKuNkY LMAO at that dumb ish😁😁😁😁 @ChickenStealer ,Yeah, Europeans, so cooperative, with their 100 year wars, monarchies with peasantry into perpetuity, royals marrying their cousins, and closer relatives, no spices in their food, toilets, or running water indoors...I find your comments ignorant and racist. I find the information here interesting, yet I think colonization rather than geography had an overwhelmingly greater role in the doom of Africa. Consider the Inca empire in South America for example. How did they manage to transform a territory so tall and so variated in climate terms, with only 2% (yes 2, not 20%) of its land adaptable for agriculture? Without taking into consideration that they didn\\'t have the wheel, iron technology and no horses or transport animals. So human policies rather then geography should be rated as the most important factor in my perspective. That is to say, colonization is not the onlybarrier in political terms and that geography is not at all irrelevant, but still I would put policies > geography. Very useful information in this video though! 👍 uneducated european/american: omg i love african culture 😻🐘🇿🇦 it\\'s my favourite country 💓💆🏻 you know how cady heron speaks african, can you speak african too???? 🤯😮\\n4:26 : aRE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT- TIL living my whole life in Georgia, didn\\'t realizing I was living in desert 2:57, Indonesian farmer and it\\'s village @Devarain S iya,  itu stock footage dari orang jawa Mirip sawah deket rumah gua itu indo??? Historians:  Empires are limited to their own climate zones.\\n\\nBritain:  Hold my tea. the only reason they colonized others is due to their technology gap @Warriors Rule You have to believe that Britain is the main reason for Africa\\'s Poverty Spain had the first empire on which the sun never set. Brits stole that phrase. See the video \"Why England is Inferior to Spain!\" 😂 Eclipse Now also, Roman culture was pretty much forced on the empire Thomas Sowell says something similar in Economic Facts and Fallacies in his chapter on Third World Facts and Fallacies (starting on p.208 - excerpt available on Amazon.)\\nHe claims that barriers to transportation limited trade and the exchange of ideas. They also lacked farm animals like horses. This left Africa poorer and, as you say, with smaller language groups  and governments.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Economic-Facts-Fallacies-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465022030/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Y8TNQWIY6WFP&dchild=1&keywords=economic+facts+and+fallacies+by+thomas+sowell&qid=1600036973&sprefix=economic+f%2Caps%2C628&sr=8-1 I enjoyed this. Made sense, though just hypothetical. Thanks This is by far the most impressive informative channel I\\'ve come across. Great questions with in-depth knowledge on the subjects you put out. I always do further research on what I learn from this channel and that just goes to show how good this channel is. Great content bro keep it coming ❤🤙🏽 wow. such interesting things i\\'ve never thought about before :o There is a book called: \" the accidental super power \". It says most of the success of United states is due to its geographic location and river systems.  Similar to the theory in here.  It\\'s a good read.... @Mark Taylor I am born in America and the truth is America is more dependent on other countries then the other way around. China is right behind us with a more united workforce and culture. They are also building relationships with other resource rich nations in Africa. All America knows in Imperialism and propaganda. When Gaddafi saw America for what it is, he became the biggest threat and he was assassinated. Just like Thomas Sankara was a threat to former colonial powers. It has always been about economic warfare. The issue is the places with the most resources are less educated. With more education, America would be at their mercy 🤣. Also all civilizations will have their end. @kobra no one likes the US, but denying they\\'re a super power is kinda silly. Don\\'t they spend like half a trillion dollars on their military every year? their economy based on oil from a global economy that drives on burning oil? if you wan to see the US tank, simply invent a substitute for oil that is as efficient. Destroyed economy. obsolete oil, the US wouldnt be able to transition fast enough away from oil when its entire national debt is based on it. then we\\'d see world war 3. But the people in the us are mostly Europeans, the natives there didn\\'t really have a lot of success before they came. @kobra you know there is more to being a superpower than just money, such as military and influence @kobra China, India, Brasil and Nigeria aren\\'t superpowers Geographical isolation of many parts of Africa, doomed the communities living there. Geography, of course. Colonization, a curse! Great video and with knowledge but you missed this one: you wrote thst Ethiopia stayed united throughout colonization but Ethiopia was never colonized! Greece was colonized while  Ethiopia was occupied by Italy for a short.time during which Africans were fighting and beating Italian aviation without even having similar weapons. Also, Ethiopia had an ancient empire called the Abyssinian empire. While they developed a strong identity by being landlocked and even went to colonize South Arabia, lack of access to the sea limited Ethiopia\\'s progress and thus why they occupied Eritrea and may try to invade others in the future. \\n\\nOverall, it is such a gread video you put together. Thanks for using real facts as this is refreshing and different than lazy racist views we usually get when explaining why Africa lags behind. \\n\\n\\nAn African geographer. But eritrea was once a part of ethiopia before the ottomans invaded it ,they r considered the same people but diffrent country\\'s @Antoine Shelby what about the Mediterrannean climate? It is the best climate today ans had been since Antiquity! Look at where European civilizations were born. Greece ans Rome! Both so close to Africa. what about north africans that managed to develop even they have mediteranean climate in the north and hot climate in the south Very well stated point, I agree Y’all I’m good in Africa until y’know goes away. so the new empire of Antarctica shall soon rule the world? Winter is coming 😂 @khalid salah 😂😂😂lol penitent2401 😂 @Rep. of Antarctica I didn\\'t know penguins could type. That scares me a little. So All of earth will be crushed by the Polar Regions Peoples SINCE They Are All Connected By  A Common Climate...I Guess? I’ll have to give this theory a lot of thought.🤔 My ancestors and nationality is on the very east coast of Africa. We\\'ve always been able to use the spice route trade from the top of the Red Sea to the bottom to our advantage. \\n\\n  Those chaps on the opposite side of the continent of us. West Africa. They have not had the same ability as we have had.\\n\\n  West Africa and East Africa alike have the Sahara desert above us making it nearly impossible to trek to the top. The primary difference with EAST Africa where I come from and WEST Africa where the blacks of America come from is neighbors.\\n\\n  In East Africa even though we\\'re cut off from the world by the Sahara desert the same as West Africa. The key differnce is, all we have separating us from the next continent and people over is the Red Sea. \\n\\n  That\\'s roughly 20 miles from the African east coast tip to the next continent over in Asia where the nations Yemen and Saudi Arabia lie.\\n\\n  Every people, kingdom and power could not have been without the incorporation of its neighbors. West Africa and literally all of Africa central Africa and below has been disabled from doing that because of Geography. \\n\\n  The Congo is what really made it impossible for the Africans below the Congo to migrate out. The Congo and everything in it might as well be a continent all its own. #FACTS.\\n   \\n  Africa is the best continent in human existence in terms of life sustainment and existing. The geography for half of its (West and south of central Africa) inhabitants is the worst thing to happen to any of the continents ever though. \\n\\n  It\\'s pure logic and history that proves my theory right. My area of Africa only ended up the way it did because we were not isolated by desert, water and distance as West and southern Africa was and is.\\n\\n  I\\'m really happy this video exists. I\\'ve known this about Africa since I was a kid. I grew up in America but American history taught me things about my color (black people) that I knew didn\\'t happen to my culture. That\\'s because I\\'m from Eritrea/Ethiopia. The geography and the history we\\'ve had with people of the other continents would not allow such an atrocity as the Atlantic slave trade to happen.\\n\\n  And I\\'m proud to say I\\'m very close to becoming an American high school geography teacher. Knowing what I know, being of the ancestory I am. Being a teacher is my best tool to be able to educate and improve the mindset of the young black child in America.\\n\\n   Black doesnt mean slavery. Black history doesn\\'t mean shackles, Jim Crow, civil rights ect. There\\'s so much more. I\\'m a living breathing example of that. And the best gift I think I can give the world is properly educating and enlightening our future generations 🌍🌎🌏 joke\\'s on you, coach P, i\\'ve already watched this video 3:50 you forget Carthage for real ? :D !! Africa: Domed because it was vertical\\n\\n\\nSouth America: Am I a joke to you? South America is not doing great too @媚如許 North America was settle when technology made it posable to have a nation in different climates. For example the railroads and telegraphs. if look at usa it  has quite bit of different climates but almost tore it self apart form it. the nations form base on who colonized what. It why you got 3 big nations that cover most of continent. @Antrix Godz Kind of Both. Hispanic culture of Iberia is pretty dominant in all of Latin America. Native American people make up   small minorities in their own land except for Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. All of this nations are the foots of or on top of Andean mountains. Mert Deniz Tatlı is way the both America’s had it just as bad as the other. 38million people in North America can claim significant amounts of ancestry from precolumbian populations, while its 32 million in South America.  Yes, most tend to be in the Andes for South America. Most tend to be in Mexico and Guatemala for North America. South America had it worse than Africa. Native populations of South America is almost entirely wiped out except for Andean regions wich is more or less a continious alpine climate area. This professor of yours wouldn\\'t happen to be Jarred Diamond would he? Apart from the Aztec and Inca empires, the same could be said for the Americas- read Jared Diamonds’ “Guns, Germs and Steel” where he goes into this in detail. In theory yes.\\nLatin America is without a doubt more complicated though for a few reasons. \\n1)Latin America was colonized for 300 years from the 1500s until the 19th century. It was a different colonial era and MUCH longer than Africa\\'s or Asia\\'s. Not to mention that it involved actual settlement by European colonists, something that besides South Africa, Algeria and pockets of Southeast Asia, didn\\'t occur much in Asia or Africa. This means that the social, cultural, economic and overall impact of colonization is MUCH DEEPER in Latin America because it was COLONIZED for 300 years, while Africa was just basically RULED AND EXPLOITED for 100. \\n2) Colonization created a complex, multiracial social hierarchy that does not exist in modern-day Africa or Asia (barring a few exceptions like South Africa). The people themselves were transformed by migration, slavery, native assimilation and immigration later on. \\n3)The countries that happened to colonize Latin America, Spain and Portugal, have a unique history within Europe, and they themselves failed to industrialize at the same time that France, Germany, the UK, the Benelux, Northern Italy and Scandinavia were. So while Britain could hope to bring its industrial and trade concepts to North America and Australia...\\n4) Latin America\\'s colonizers exported their unequal oligarchy, semi-feudal labor systems, corrupt and totalitarian political traditions, and religious extremism to their American colonies. \\n\\n\\nFinally, the Latin American reality is extremely complex because it is not exactly a continuation of the Spanish empire, while it isn\\'t quite a continuation of its Indigenous civilizations. Identity is necessary for a people to move forward and strive to become better. And this is something that is still being questioned everywhere from Mexico down to Argentina How IMPERIALISM doomed Africa. ( and the rest of the world ) I want to explain IMO why Africa as a whole (with the possible exception of various North African societies, including Egypt) never advanced the same as the Eurasian societies. \\n- Isolated from the Silk Route. With the exception of Egypt and to a lesser extent, the East African societies such as Somalia, much of Africa was far from the silk route, and the silk route was the main reason why much of Eurasia was able to further develop technologically, socially and even unite than African societies. The spread of ideas and various goods via help Eurasian civilizations progress.\\n- Geography and Climate. Pretty much how the video explains it, but I wanted to further elaborate. Much of Africa is either hot and dry (with all the heatwaves and droughts) or hot and humid (with all the diseases). It is extremely difficult to even advanced or develop civilization in these type of climates. Egypt is an exception, but this is only due to the fact that one, Egypt developed near a river valley and was influenced by West Asian agriculture. There were other African civilizations other than Egypt, but they all came as a result of influences from later advanced societies (especially Muslim).\\n\\n\\nHonestly, the only parts of Africa that were able to develop at the same pace as Eurasia are Egypt and North Africa, but really, this is mostly due to the fact that these places were in contact with Eurasia (especially the Levant in Egypt\\'s case) where they engaged in trade with other advanced societies.  \\n\\n\\nI also wanted to address the slavery issue (not to cause a firestorm or anything). As horrible a practice slavery is, people have to stop acting as if Europeans first started the enslavement of Africans. Europeans were not the first ones to enslave Africans. Africans have been practicing slavery since the beginning of time (in fact, slavery has existed in literally every society, not just Africa), and the first Eurasians to exploit this were the Arabs and later the Turks. And it was other Africans who were selling their own people to the European colonists. I find it hypocritical how people demonize Europeans (in particular the British and French) for enslavement of Africans, but ignore Arab Muslim and Turkish Muslim enslavement of Africans (or even just throw the idea of Muslims enslaving Africans under a bus), or ignore the fact that it was practiced in the African continent since the beginning of time. Even Iberians (Spaniards and Portuguese) don\\'t get as pressed as the British and French when it comes to talking about African enslavement. I once read that Africa is also limited by rivers that are not practical for commercial shipping and thick jungles that limit trading on border regions. Africa was right in the middle of all the trade stfu Africa is the best location on earth @5674 82 most of the western coast is cliffs. That\\'s why many countries chose to sail around it. @Jesse Hodgson Mother Nature had her ways and means but we are so smart there\\'s no reason humanity shouldn\\'t terraform Earth.  I\\'m certain we won\\'t make any more mistakes that Mother Nature and Lady Luck have made.   So far we have been lacking in an overarching rational pollicy;  sadly we have been terraforming using trash and cutting down trees to make French provintial furniture or grow GMO monocrops.  I\\'m not a greenie but there needs to be a policy to investigate our responsibility to magnify the beauty of Earth rather than compel a static solution of Earth changes. @Altiere Xhina:allow us to introduce ourself. Kizz not if rivers are not navigable, no natural harbors, deserts, impenetrable jungle, and beachheads that a re sheer cliffs. Sociology has nothing to do with that. انا اتكلام في كل علم في كل علم في سلام في كل افريكة我说一鈤太平peacepaixмирpaz It\\'s part of Jared Diamond\\'s thesis in Guns, Germs, and Steel 1:07 inaccurate map I just happened o be reading \"Guns Germs & Steel\" when I came across this video. It\\'s definitely not the whole picture, but overall I think this is a great video. Imagine being Africa\\n\\n\\n_This comment was made by Eurasia gang_ @Srokasodo sounded more like a historical reference lol MethnoState Mel Lol it’s a 1984 reference @Srokasodo \\n>war\\n>more like enslaved lol @Morgai Fly Wrong. Europe and Asia are different continents. Europe, Africa, Asia, North and South America, Antarctica and Australia are continents. @Smug Anime Girl No. watching this for school during covid 19 outbreak Dave foxy same Very interesting theory. This definitely had an effect on them Great video. I have often thought about our history with relation to our geography. Your arguments make good sense. This was brought up by Jared Diamond in \\'Guns, Germs, and Steel\\'.  Good video though This theory is called geographical determinism. It was described in detail in the 1997 book \"Guns, germs and steel\" by Jared Diamond. Another theory suggesting Europeans benefited from being close to the Middle East, but not in it ----- basically, every way imaginable to not say white Europeans were just superior to everybody else at one time, (because that would be so racist) and benefited from their own mental abilities, rather than those that other cultures benefited from at other times.  (You could say Arabs or Asians were superior to everyone else at certain times and that\\'s fine, but you can\\'t say whites were, and if they were, THERE MUST BE a reason for it, probably because they were near some other people who WEREN\\'T white!!!) Also it\\'s not a theory, its reality. @MethnoState Mel ok bruh. Whatever u wanna believe to make urself feel better about white advancement... its in the books. But you know, self deception is a bitch... @I- I for one no they didn\\'t pay taxes to France two France left them a governing system infrastructure and much more. in that time Germany has been bombed into oblivion and occupied by the allies japan has been nuked twice also occupied by the allies south Korea fought a bloody civil war whats Haiti\\'s excuse muh had to pay money to France but it didn\\'t even happen though. @Zimmit\\'s FunHouse Adventure ummm sure? good job, my friend. thank you for your efforts. I’m glad Africa is finally taking off. They are starting to develop really well. Kwo yeah, I know. I hate when people say : “africa(in general) is backward” it infuriates me Anime battles battle Royale Africa is a continent, made up of many countries, with many governments. Help I\\'m A Rock yeah true. Honestly Africa just needs a stable government and also needs to become secular. Religion really causes hindrance in society lewis1544 but that’s still improvement, and in a long term perspective it’s eventually going to get better @Chris Malan Geez, Nsibidi, Adinkra, Meroitic are all indigenous sub saharan african scripts, and MANY East and West africans used the wheel prior to european contact\\n\\nyou sound stupid spewing that eurocentric bullshit about africa not developing anything I also agree on this matter. I was feeling the same about why Europe thrived so well? It\\'s a very interesting idea with evidence that backs it up. But Damn! It\\'s just so hard to believe. \\nMaybe if we just look at it as pretty significant contribution to the Africa of today. Dear Internet, \\nFinally some ORIGINAL content and some things you can learn in digestible 5-7 minute videos.\\nWe need to support a channel like this with subscriptions. (Just saying....and no, i dont know content creator). Too bad its mostly wrong though. Its basically misinformation. I guess i just gave that effect on people lol mbear1 lol thanks @Gaming With Jake 😂😂😂 You\\'re cracking me up Somtimes all 3 Well I know one reason why there is lack of development......... I have a solution to this. Bt it needs international cooperation and a space to present 2000 pages blue print. 🙁 A large part is due to japan and europe being rebuilt after WW2 by the US.  If the US had never rebuilt japan and europe then they would be 3rd world countries @Makker Don LOL read a history book you idiot @None of your Business just because you belong to the herd doesnt make your view of the matter valid :P @Makker Don a differing opinion does not equal a valid one.  There is no need to counter you because REALITY counters your idiocy @None of your Business i have dont worry. just because I have a different opinion to you doesnt mean I dont read. but if that is your only counter argument then so be it <3 :P @Makker Don read a history book Most of Africa\\'s problems stem from tribalism. If it was divided among ethnic lines it would look like the HRE on steroids. This has been the case since before European colonisation and the way current African nation states were born and drawn up with arbitrary borders just perpetuates this. Socio-economic exploitation by foreign interests plays it\\'s hand in it as well, but Africa\\'s main enemy is almost always itself, civil wars and corruption. Actually, this theory should be expanded by the fact that most of Africa has basically no climate variations throughout the year, so the tribes there weren\\'t forced to develop technology to maintain a certain diet all year round. \\nSo for example, in the Congo Rainforest, fruit grow without any stop for winter, autumn or spring. It\\'s eternal summer there. \\nUnlike Europe or China, which had some harsh winters that forced those civilisations to develop technology for storing crops harvested in the summer Egypt, the Assyrian Empire, The Persian Empire, And Carthage had no winters and they did quite well for themselves. This \"Good climate makes you lazy\" shit needs to die off... @Altieres Del-Sent great answer @skellagyook Wow! Impressive African history knowledge. Made it better by referencing and quoting academic sources. And even with non academic ones like Wikipedia it\\'s much better than anyone who\\'s not quoting anything (I realise that some references on wiki articles are academic so one can go to the source and verify wiki as false or not)\\n\\nReally motivated and inspired to study more African history. Mad respect for you!!! Altieres Del-Sent I’m African and I believe that that argument had a very good structure and knowledgeable evidence. The words you used indicates bias and I would suggest that you first try to formulate an argument of your own with some good evidence and reply with that. Also, it is undeniable that Africa has a problem and European settlers undeniably did some damage that still affects Africa to this day. Therefore, knowing this could be a possible outcome it could help us as humans to be less hateful to each other in the coming years and just jump these types of obstacles to reach a better point in humanity. @Jack again with the stupid IQ argument. That bullshit rhetoric has been debunked ages ago! And then about when the entire Sahara was lush green for tens of thousands of years \\nAnd the  savannah ,will turn again with rivers and lakes \\nIt\\'s was just a slight tilt of the earth which is due again \\nand that will be coming again ?\\nAnd what will you be saying then .? This is brilliant info! Good eye opener! never even crossed my mind, good theory It\\'s not a theory it\\'s a hypothesis, but otherwise really interesting. Good video. I would only add no navigable rivers, fewer farm animals, more dangerous animals and nature in general, nomadic life style due to climate. None of these encourage organised states formation. Omg open this on ur phone put it in landscape and turn your phone to the left Africa is just vertical Australia 2:02 southern tip @Mebrahtu Ghirmay True. Now I see.\\nThanks I think he meant \\'the same as we found in the northern tip earlier.\\' Because he mentioned it earlier bro 1:41 the first time in my life I hear that Iran and Central Asian countries are deserts, I think you do not know what a desert is...\\nIf you use google earth or look at images from the web or go to these countries you will find it that most of central Asia and Iran are not desert countries. Interesting theory.  Climate would seem to be contributing factor, but I think the relatively slow development of Africa has more to do with the lack of navigable waterways than climate diversity.  Ancient civilizations needed water for efficient transportation of people, goods, and (most importantly) ideas.  Europe is 1/3 the size of Africa, and its entire eastern side is land locked.  Africa is 3x the size of Europe and is completely surrounded by water.  And yet, Europe has more coastline than Africa because of it\\'s relatively jagged outline.  There are many, many natural harbors along Europe\\'s coast, and relatively few along Africa\\'s coast.  The continental shelf along Africa\\'s entire west coast is relatively shallow, so large ships can not approach it.  People and goods have to be transferred to smaller boats to approach land, whereas Europe\\'s harbors can accommodate docking for direct transfer of both.  Europe also has many more navigable rivers in its interior.  It\\'s not a surprise that the only navigable river in Africa (the Nile) happens to be the only place that ancient civilization flourished on the continent. @Marcus Tullius Cicero - Wasn\\'t the Ghana Empire in the Niger River basin?  If so, that would support my point that navigable water was essential to the development of ancient civilization. @Ebro Big boy - Agreed.  And those facts support my central point. @Object Oriented - Agreed.  But I\\'m not sure whether you\\'re supporting or refuting my initial point. @finao o Theres also the axumite empire, nubia and the nok culture. Well Niger River had a lot of civilization like the Mali Songhai and Ghana empires. The Congo river had empires like the Kongo and the Nile river had kush Nubia and Egypt That\\'s a fascinating and potentially useful theory, and one I haven\\'t heard before! Thanks for presenting it. How to do it in americas way?\\nAns.: Exploit the resources...kill its people...oppress its rights...make a movie about it to show how sorry you are...blame the geography for the disaster. That’s a great insight actually. As myself being a north African, i can affirm the validity of this theory. here for example in southern Algeria alone, we witness various incidents of ethnic nature which ARE  very much driven by climactic and regional conflicts. Holocaust happened, American/French revolution happened, WWI/II happened, Balkan wars happened, Bloody Sunday happened The success of the Silk Road as mode for the exchange of people, goods, technology and ideas is a clear example of the benefits of a long horizontal geography. @CNN is Fake News seeing your comment and read your username..... Ironic. @Fern Henley no the advancing desert is because the climate change Europe become fertile people start to migrated north This is complete lunacy... Are you saying that if a horizontal line of gentle, rolling hills existed there, everyone would choose the harsh deserts where water is scarce? Would they prefer to cross mountains, rather than walk across grassy plains? Complete idiocy... of course they would take the easiest path. They\\'re trading spices and silks for money, not for the scenery. @mustafa saral Wrong. Mohammed never ceased being a professional slaver - likewise the so-called \"rightly guided\" caliphs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZxH4QYLRQY @CNN is Fake News lel wutt This makes more sense than what I heard in the past. There\\'s something called ecology i.e adaptation to physical surroundings. So no matter the geography, humans can adapt. Maybe what we learn from the African geography is \"you should not invade your neighbors and stay within your comfort zone\".\\nSorry but I don\\'t see a unified Europe, though they share the same climate they have at least 17 languages, divided into 25 countries with even microcountries. Some countries share the same language but they are still distinct countries.\\nIf you want to compare adjust your scale for a better comparison : divided as we see, how would western Europe look if it was the size of Africa? Yes. So this whole video is terrible now... fucking sike, still a great video. The US and Europe have wide variations in terrain and climate....live in Arizona then move to Vermont, live in Southern Greece then move to Finland. ',\n",

I only have one... :( No I need to stop watching these vids, the more I watch the more I realize my island is hot garbage I\\'m jealous and don\\'t want to put in the work lol @StrawberryGirlKairi Right? I feel like that every time I watch a first 5-star island tour. When I watch these kind of videos I (almost) feel bad this is so true T_T Same. And it just feeds my addiction to get things just right. Look away. We gotta look away! lol i dont know why but when i look at other people’s islands i feel like they have a much bigger space to work with. like my island feels like an ant compared to them @Orion Cornelius there\\'s too many downsides of teraforming it all flat for me like I have a staircase up to my museum plot of land and also a cool higher plot of land for a performance area surrounded by a stream of water connecting to a waterfall behind my house... Just looks nicer imo. But I also hate city builds, much more interested in a rural setting or something more moody and less \"LOOK AT ME I\\'M HERE AND I EXIST\" feeling. @daladorous yup. Right?!? @daladorous yeah like honestly I prefer islands with better terraforming over a lot of stuff Jorge Ortega yeah I recommend starting at the entrance then work at the plaza,neighborhood etc. My goodness, I so want to live there Ok like everyone knows this island probably makes you feel really bad at Animal Crossing.\\n\\nBut you should always just be proud of what you’ve done. Because you did it, no one else. I NEED THIS HAHA I\\'m currently proud that I pathed my whole lower level All For One&One For All man it’s just animal crossing 💀 it’s not that deep Soccer Boy You don’t need to time travel. You can make a lot of bells just by selling fruit that are non native, and then slowly cataloging all the items. Nookazon is a game changer. All For One&One For All - Yikes. Cynical much. If this is your outlook on life then what’s the point to anything? Before watching this: Yeah my island is fine af.\\xa0\\nAfter watching this: What did Isabelle smoke when she gave me 5 stars? 🤣🤣🤣 I feel like you should be in a discord call with the people who own the islands so they can give you a tour and tell you things about it For real! @tobi your a savage, classy......(continue it) i was just looking at my notifications and i have 2.4k likes????? crazy Omg yessss!!!!!!!!! I need the D E T A I L S I don’t like how he just runs off. They put some much time into the island, he should let them give him an actual tour. Meanwhile my island looks like a giant garage sale with random shit everywhere cuz I\\'m out of storage NasserFeed mine too Congratulations to you, i literally am convinced that it\\'s impossible to fill up my storage so I\\'m just giving up on getting that nook miles achievement lmao. I\\'ve tried but bro how tf do you fill 1,200 spaces of storage. literally same and im a hoarder and dont wanna sell any of it lmao Nasser Feed you cant try Puting it into the storage in the house or maybe you can put it in the very corner of the island that you don’t use Before this video: \"Actually I love my island, it\\'s really coming together,\"\\nAfter this video: \"Ok, plan change, I need to redo EVERYthing\" ive come to terms with these islands are meant to be a representation of you and what you like. I stopped trying to make these crazy islands and just make what I like. Yo this was exactly my reaction, but trust it really really inspired me. Right after this I redid my whole island and now have a five star and I actually feel good about my island now lol DasPikachu me looking at my trash ass island I was so proud of 😭 I just got 5-star today, I spent hours making really big paths and chairs and everything. I see this already knowing my housing isn’t great, then after watching more now I see that most of my island is wasted space, poorly optimized, or is inaccessible. I have a huge lake area up some stairs and there isn’t enough room for furniture around that... Heck my housing has an incline that isn’t even really needed. I may eventually time travel cuz of this ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ Me: *goes to Isabelle*\\n\\nIsabelle: “Your villagers are saying that there is too much stuff lying around, 2 stars.”\\n\\nMe: Looks at my crafting corner that is lined up with every single one of my crafting supplies YUP!!!

Thanks both of you XD I’ll go do that Just put them in your house storage and have a crafting table, I find it easier  to go to my house dump all my stuff, take what I need etc It kinda bothers me that she’s trying to lead him around but he just won’t follow her! He goes on his own! I feel like she probably had an order she wanted to show things but he just kept going his own way he asked tho and shes just following hell yeah i find it quite disrespectful I think he always asks the people first if they want to lead him or let him explore himself 1 week into quarantine: what is the person called who seats you in a restaurant? a receptionist? is that it? This island is so cute! I don\\'t think I could ever build anything like this. You need to give yourself more credit. I love these islands, but after a while all the \"zen\" and \"japanese\" gets repetitive. They all start to look the exact same This seems like 500 hours of work to me lol, I\\'ve got almost 100 hours and basically nothing to show for it Literally same hahaha. same, i have 152 hours of work and i still even havent had the kk concert The whole wedding area is beyond amazing if my wedding doesn‘t look half as good as this one I will riot Lmaaaaooooo @Jaime Wissner Not necessarily....man made waterfalls are not as loud as natural ones...unless the builder gets massive pumps. A lot of water has to be moved to create that kind of sound. And the design can be altered so the water cascades down instead of falling. Besides you wouldn\\'t want the water to fall anyways because it would splash to much. But think of the sound from those waterfalls. It would kill the audio from the videos @RadenWA Actually that could be created....costly but I could...or another engineer/contractor can build it. * Watches a five-star island *\\n\\n\\n* Sees why his island is only three-stars. * My island is 5 stars and looks like a garbage dump compared to this. I wish one day we’ll be able to cook in AC. I mean, fishing, foraging, catching bugs, all relaxing activities. Is it just me who finds cooking enjoyable and relaxing? Campfire grilling, oven cooking, pan frying fishes, blending fruits for juice. No need for hunger or stamina system. Just cooking for fun. @Cookies & Cream PETA was complaining? Because of fishing in Animal Crossing? Don\\'t tell them about Red Dead Redemption 2... But seriously, the more they act on stupid things like that, the less I take them seriously. Prussian Eagle Oh yeah, good idea. Now I can feed my chicken some nuggets and my cow a burger. Also PETA was complaining about catching fish and donating them to blathers, they would go nuts if you could cook them. @Prussian Eagle LOL then you can have fat villagers xDDDD Yeah I wanna make like a McDonald’s or something in my island. It feels more urban. Plus with cooking I actually feel like I can escape from life and live on another world. It feels more realistic ya know what I mean? The only thing that makes me feel good about this video is knowing I have never time traveled... And that\\'s why my island doesn\\'t look this good. (Lol my island will never look this good) Tbh if my wedding gets canceled to hell because of The Rona™ I might as well just get married in Animal Crossing instead Gitgud Corporation that’s so sad ;( @Gitgud Corporation Oh no im sorry. :(\\nYeah it sucks, did you have postpone it? and move the venue and vendors around? thats exactly what happened to me lol. My wedding was supposed to be today, in Seychelles lol Free idea for others to use: Start new accounts and turn their houses into additional shops. (Bookstores, restaurants, etc. etc.) The fake character can be the one that “runs” it. ...!\\n\\nCYD! YOU BETTER MOVE OUT Excuse my ignorance but how do you move additional people villagers into the town?? c i v i l i a n #1 I would love to see that satanic church actually genius CaronDriel tell this to new leaf players 🤩🤩🤩 It amazes me how people do this i cant even imagine doing this 😲 Chimp easy with an island generator and a hacked nintendo switch TagBack: All the little things to have that look like there\\'s people here is just so...\\n\\nMe: Creepy \\n\\nTagBack: Cool!\\n\\nMe: Cool! this is the best island I\\'ve seen on youtube. so creative and beautiful without being over cluttered. also nice change of pace to see some different designs compared to the norm I see. I really need to buy animal crossing lol. oh and a switch. I need to stop watching these to save my self esteem  but I can’t Five star islands are lit but one star islands are where it\\'s at because you know all they be doin is fishing like me lol Matthew De Matos yeah! People say they take pride in not time travelling and shit like ?? Same game different styles, it’s not an accomplishment not to time travel and it’s not a bad thing either I FEEL SEEN AND VISIBLE LMFAOOOO lmao yeah, I can relate to that ! Username?? And that’s totally cool! Time travellers aren’t going around shitting on people who don’t time travel, it’s the other way around. Imagine having your wedding there and the pastor just shouting in a microphone so everybody can actually hear him. Waterfalls are kinda loud xD SO WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY! She: having a wonderful island\\nMe: wishing to have that island Am I the only person who still loves the simplicity of the older games, like Wild World? 😅 I just find this way too much @Gitgud Corporation Or just make your Island very simple. That\\'s what I\\'m doing, I want it to be more natural and spaced out. @ella with all the different colors of furniture its harder than ever to get the items you want to decorate with i think the worst example of it is the outdoor design items they give you where you redeem nook miles theyre basically locked into whatever variation you got when you created your island for example the vending machine and streetlight they can both come in a handful of colors - i personally dont get why you cant customize all items diy style that have various versions i feel like barely any furniture is manually customizable, i fill up my inventory with furniture items then attempt to customize something just to set myself up for disappointment every time Carla B. • you can still play the game without trading though; it just makes it easier to obtain things like furniture to decorate your island with, art and fossils! i like new horizons because you can play however you want; whether it would be designing paths, finding the best clothes, playing the game vanilla without trading or time travel, or making an amazing 5-star island with designated areas and lots to see. that’s the fun of the game~ AliciaGaldon you are not alone. My daughter is into the trading and discord servers and things and I have no idea what’s going on. I miss having a game where you buy it and it has all you need to play it. No need to trade or do anything extra. There\\'s a lot of islands that try to replicate that natural look. Because sometimes islands get too cluttered (specially with those fake paths that I personally hate) One of my favorite islands I seen!!! Gives me inspiration!!!! Not a time traveler so it’s going to take awhile but that’s kind of fun for me. HAPPY ANIMAL CROSSING EVERYONE!!! If the rumours are true about Brewster and other shops coming soon...Imagine having an island fully decorated then realising where to put the new shops and stuff lol there’s supposedly gonna be farming as well .-. rip all of the crazy terraformed islands @SuperAvocado islands are never completed haha there will always be something to improve, the game doesn\\'t end Well, those people are playing the way you\\'re not supposed to by time travelling anyway. So it\\'s their own fault for rushing the game.\\nI don\\'t know what they do once they complete their island like that. They restart the game I guess? Carma for lookin too gud Ruby Violet I’m hoping we can buy extra islands around our island lol... there’s so much water space 😩 Imagine how many bells this person put into this. This island looks alright, but seems way too cluttered to me. Like she focused more on aesthetic than things being actually functional. Example is all the chairs you can\\'t sit in and the fact there\\'s no mountain top river so how do you get those specific fish? She’s technically done the game so she does not need it to be to functional The best thing in animal crossing is fishing so if you can’t fish I’m out I love the way these islands look as a visitor and appreciate the hard work behind them, but I agree. I personally wouldn\\'t want mine to be as cluttered, it makes me feel claustrophobic and overwhelmed somehow. Alright?? It was beautiful @CaptainX weeds, I don\\'t think so 9:27 \"We\\'ve got some more stalls here with yeeting areas...\"\\n\\nCan\\'t have an island without those. Check out Austin John Plays’ island  he played the game fully raw without time travelling and has a 5 star island and its actually amazing I’m going to have three sections to my island, I have figured an idea where the area you enter the island will be where the shops and other buildings will be.\\nThe second section is a suburban area, you enter through a bridge and then that’s where my and residents houses will be.\\nThen the last section will be a garden. You can enter the garden from the suburbs and the town. \\n\\nI’m almost sure my idea will change but those are the plans for the future. 🙂 I love the fact she\\'s done all this without using custom designs :D I think it actually makes it more impressive! AngelConfetti oh shit I didn’t even notice that. Amazing! How could anyone dislike this. This island is absolutely INSANE! But in a good way! Imagine trying to get THAT many iron nuggets 😫 how do y’all have that much time 🤯 It\\'s kind easy if you hoard tons of iron nuggets in the beginning. 160 hrs already and mine not look like this 😔 * edit I know have 200 hrs and it still the same lmao * @Leah Uzumaki You are manipulating the game mechanics and use it to an advantage with isn\\'t intended by the developers as the normal way to play. Even Nintendo tried to prevent timeshifting. So, it\\'s basically cheating. But since it\\'s more or less a singleplayer game and a game where you can use any mechanics for your own creativity and way to play, it actually doesn\\'t really matter. I cheated myself by timeshifting several times, too. But that\\'s my way to get the game flow and progress how I desire. Time traveling is Not cheating, some of y\\'all never played animal crossings and it shows Where did she get all the ressources and bells to build all this in such a short time? I play every day and I am not even close to this amount of island detail. She also has tons of stuff that costs lots of Nook Miles. @Triple D I never said I time traveled. I don\\'t. @Bukowski Family ur playing the game wrong. I\\'m not saying you shouldn\\'t but nintendo never made the game so you can skip ahead and get more so quickly. However it\\'s not cheating bc this is one of those games that you can just do whatever you want This island made me feel so bad about the trash I\\'ve been working so hard on.... I need to stop watching these videos because I AM NOT starting from scratch. \"about to get married, very scary\" hahahahahahahaha! currently crying cuz im realizing how much freaking work my island needs :( How do people get suchgood island in about 3 weeks?!\\nThis looks so good even from the map at the start Since it was out at the very beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of people had nothing to do so they played the game non stop. Kind of like what i did. you never know how much you actually invest into the game in 2-3 weeks without TT’ing. Easy DaRon makes sense he had it one day before release @ya_boi_h_innit The updated shop comes after 29 or 30 days. So rather he had the game before release or he timeshifted. Release isn\\'t 29 days ago. Sara Rice thats actually not true DanTDM doent time skip and he has it She definitely time travelled, she has a fully upgraded nooks cranny which you can\\'t have yet without time jumping. Bruhh...after seeing this island it makes me want to re do my whole island and its a five star place 😂😂😂😂😂😂 So pretty, I’m getting a lot of garden inspo from that wedding area and bee keeper area I lost it at “post wedding eating area” Meanwhile you got me over here waiting for switches to get back in stock😐 I\\'m so happy to see an island that isn\\'t dependent on cherry blossom trees/ pastel colors. As much as I love those aesthetics, this is one of the most creatively designed and appealing islands I\\'ve seen! Kudos to the creator! My favorite island you’ve toured so far! The amount of detail put into this is amazing. Really enjoyed it!😍💖 There’s this and then theres my island This reminds me of my roleplaying days in Habbo or Those fake habbo hotels xD Me seeing this amazing 5 star island : *omg I need to get on acnh right now and do this!!*\\n\\nAlso me: *wait this involves tons of money and also not being a noob* Her home is so beautiful! Yo I think they be calling restaurant receptionists “hosts” You are right, it is \"receptionist.\" Whenever Tag enters the room he says “ohhh” THIS\\n\\nTHIS IS TOP TIER\\n\\nBEST ISLAND IVE SEEN SO FAR HANDS DOWN I really like this one but since pretty much everyone will be going for a city like style i can only recommend you his haunted isle video. The nature style and use of terraforming is just amazing She’s got a lot of items already! I’d love that Japanese stone lantern and indoor wall plants *enters a new room in the house*\\n\\n“Oooooooh” He said what I was thinking \"I wish I could be this creative.\" Sums it all up for me. Oh my god, this was incredible. Why does my island feel so small? I need to learn how to maximize it like her. Wow this is incredible. I can’t imagine the hours put into this. :o very gorgeous Me: frantically taking screenshots to get island inspo The reception area blew me away! The details and how everything compliments each other kudos to those creators! The camping area and points of recreation made me feel like I was actually there in that island, it warmed my heart 😍😩 \"post-wedding eating area\" sir, you mean the RECEPTION lmao I love your videos, just teasing never thought my own island could make me depressed until watching these 5 star island videos wow this is definitely one of the most beautiful islands i\\'ve seen so far \"it\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen a telephone pole too\"\\nMe: has 3 utility poles out :\\') This gives me so much inspiration!! This is amazing!! I feel equally inspired and discouraged lol. Amazing Island, so much detail and thought in everything I\\'m just gonna stop watching these videos. All they do is make me realize how lame my island is. Plot twist: Those are DLC\\'s from eshop. I’m a fan of his little “ouhh”s every time he enters a new room My towns nearing completion id love to show when its done, i feel its very “full” I love the creativity on this island, I can tell how much effort went into this! \\n\\nThat being said, am I the only one who prefers islands with less clutter than this? There\\'s just so much stuff everywhere. My ialand is only 4 stars currently, and my main focus has been flowers/trees with some decor here and there. Hey I was wondering how you become a member. She’s trying to lead him around, he’s being kinda rude and running around where he wants and bumping into her and stuff. Also. I think the island is too crowded i love that she has Stale Cupcakes by KK playing everywhere!!! my favorite song by him. beautiful. I only watch these videos for his, \"ohhhhwoooh!\" \\'s . . . “Cool! Fantastic! Wonderful! Genius! Well done! Nice! Very nice! Adorable! What?! So cool! Oh my goodness! So good! Magnificent! Ooh! Perfect! So nice! Phenomenal! Jaw-dropping! Spectacular! So amazing! 10/10! Very chill! Really really nice! Beautiful! Absolutely insane!”\\n\\nThis man does not need a thesaurus. HOW DO YOU GET DIFFERENT FRUITS I ONLY HAVE PEACHES AND COCONUTS AND IM DYING HELP ME PLS you trade with other people and occasionally can get other fruit in the mail Amazing! I want to live here! Lol\\nSo at this point in the game I\\'m guessing you don\\'t actually use your island for any resources? Seems like doing \\'daily\\' activities would be hard. This island is beautiful! I love how every one is unique even if you get similar inspiration. I love my island too but I definitely wouldn\\'t get this guy to come over... I find the way he runs everywhere and pushes you about is kinda rude it would stress me out. seawein I agree she’s trying to lead him around and he just goes wherever he wants. It’s quite rude. Thanks for making me feel like a damn hobo May lol Am I the only one who’s super excited for the horror themed islands? I feel like they’ll be suuuuuper cool in ACNH! @Leah Rose Thank you for the nostalgia trip ;) Leah Rose I really hope so because I feel like they can make an actual scary town now I wonder if the Aika village creator is making another one, that would be cool. I’m currently working on a sort of horror themed island. It’s supposed to be a nice atmosphere with a sort of feeling something is wrong.\\n\\nSo I’m other words, people are working on them so you’ll probably be seeing them soon. :) Yes! The horror islands are always my favorite lmao I don’t even have this much furniture lmao 🥺 Why does her island look way bigger than mine though D: I have been editing my island like crazy and I ran out of space ㅠㅠㅠ ANyone else notice the Pulp Fiction reference in her diner?? <3 In love with this island! I\\'m saving up for this game and i\\'m getting super pumped up! It\\'s my first animal crossing, do yall have any tips that I can learn? Just when i think my island looks great, i realize i need thousands of more items Concuzzion Gloving what a humbling experience for us lol! I was so excited to have a park and now I see this I made a cafe in my house New Leaf, and this has given me the idea to create a better one outside!\\n\\n\\nINSPIRATIONAL ISLAND HOLY CRAP! People: Yeah, I dont time travel..\\n\\nTheir Island: i just watch these, get sad and move on lol. but i still love them!!! Me 90 hours into my island: Hey I made a path I found online to go from my house to the shop! >-> I\\'m finally putting things together and my 8th villager is going to show up so I can tear my island apart. Yes!  Finally someone using weeds as part of the decorations! Me playing animal crossing: Wow my island is really coming together ☺️\\n\\nMe after watching this video: Are you kidding me Same I like am just about halfway to getting my residential area looking how I want.. Isabelle: you don\\'t have enough flowers, 2 star rating.\\n\\nMy island:  5:12 ',\n",
       " 'Today I am finally feeling proud for having the strength to leave a Narcissistic abusive relationshiT. I\\'ve been sad confused exhausted but after seeing this movie it gave me a huge pat on my back💪💪💪These abusive behaviors have a horrible ripple effect. I\\'m safe. Good for you Lola. How are you doing now, one year after this post? I hope that you have found yourself gain, and that you have learned how strong and unbreakable you are! So happy for u @Lola Pear Very proud of you Lola! God has given you the strength you need to move forward in life by truly loving yourself more and first! God Bless you! @VIRTUOUS,THERESA Guiton you\\'ll get there dont worry... The new feelings of happiness, calm and safety that take over the horrible feelings that you are feeling now will be your reward... Blessings to you my friend None of the new Lifetime movies can compare to these older tv movies from the 70’s - 90’s. Good stories, directors, and actors. I.perfer the 1940s movies black and white no one comes close to that acting @Carrie nunya imbecile you what 6vyears old?🖕👎🏼🤪😱🤯🤫😝😜😎🤔🤨🤬😠😠😡🤡🧐😡 @Carrie nunya yor an immature asswipe stfu gtfu!!! @Shannon Littlefield jesus rhisnt a f lifetime movie! @jenny misteqq his name was terry. Why Lifetime can\\'t make quality movies like this anymore?  The majority they make now are down right awful. Because they try to adhere to today\\'s society which sucks because today\\'s society is boring and to sexual SMH 😠 This isn\\'t a lifetime movie. @Becki Green Yes I enjoyed it @kamales pari Try Pure flix good movies!!! I watched a movie on there and it was about a little boy that eas lost I can\\'t remember the name but it is a true story. @Eva Lindstrom 😇 Bring back the old LMN movies! They should have a channel that plays allll the classic movies 😍😍😍 Yup She Says Im 16, Been Watching Lmn Since I Was 4 With My Mom & G-ma, But Started Watching The Old Ones At 8. They Dont Make Em Like The Old Movies Anymore... The New Ones Are Trash ! @Summer Capps You are more than welcome. @Pennie P thank you I\\'m doing that now @Summer Capps \\n\\nOh! \\nCheck out \\nCOMPRISEING POSITIONS \\nSusan Sarandon and Raul Julia A very raw, honest and emotional movie for the 80\\'s. The actors did an amazing job. RIP River Phoenix. The old lady was getting on my nerves 😂 😑 River Phoenix......what a sad situation.....so much talent just destroyed. @ícҽís թհօҽղíx 0. xzx7xcxd7czx77x7x7z7 ZZ c7zxszxzscfzxzududududduududd7ceudd7udd7d77dudd77d7dud7c7d7f7d7dx7d7d7dz7d7x7xd7x7zd7zxs7d7d7d7x7d77uxu7duxuduxuuxcuxu7x7c7c7xz7x7z6 The grandmas annoying asf i don\\'t blame the daughter.. yes❤️ rip river Never take a man back that disappears for weeks,self respect. Troy Wright no the kids were clueless as he was their dad and could do no wrong. And yeah he’ll be off once another pretty young thing takes his eye again. He just took advantage of his wife’s weak position. A strong independent woman would have told him to get lost and stay lost! Avery Pack tbh I think he took advantage of her as she was in a weak position and needed help. But hopefully he kept paying the bills especially for the nursing home !! I don\\'t mind forgiveness, but the husband never admitted he did wrong, and the kids never seemed to realise that their dad messed up. @rzum81 that\\'s bad if she needs him more? Right? He could do it again and shows she needs him more than he needs her. Wow River Phoenix would be turning 50 soon. Crying shame, a real talent and so young Teresa Linton YES sad one less drug addict junkie Guess what he died a day after my 7th birthday it\\'s so hard to believe it\\'s been over 20 years sad. @Teresa Linton died from heroin overdose @DarlingNikki2 wow I never realized they were brothers and both are talented thanx for the info I remembered river as young Indiana Jones River Phoenix was just a boy here. He was so beautiful, like his brother, Joaquin. These old movies were the best. I used to love Tuesday Weld, it’s good to see her again. How did he die ? The grandma walking in the rain hurt my soul. Alzheimer\\'s patients do that, taking off at night no matter how cold or how late. Yep my mom has Alzheimer’s and she’s 67...she’s stuck mentally at age 15 @Stephanie Alexander omg that is so sad, I\\'m so sorry. 😔 Jane Doe My grandmother disappeared and walked from our house all the way to her home with my grandpa in EAST NEW YOK ...heartbreaking My sweet Mother in law did the same thing. She went out in 20 degree weather with just a very thin night gown, it scared me to death. We did find her and she was so cold. @Linda Thrall I know I am a care giver for someone who is in a early stage of  dementia The Quarantine blues got me watching old movies and pacing my floors LOL I do that anyway lol lol I can hardly watch the news LMN once you have grew up watching the old LMN it’s hard set and actually watch these new episodes! The acting back then we’re so superb and the writers actually cared about good and interesting material. @Aspen Robinson actually a lot of actors are in hallmark movies now This was cbs I\\'m still trying to find this one particular movie, I think it was called \\'\\'stranger in my attic\\'\\' or something like that, it was about this guy who lived next door to a pretty blonde, and at first he was quite helpful as she asked him to come over and fix this and that, but then he was just hanging around a little too much and she started to become uncomfortable about him, one day she came home from work to find him coming down out of the garage attic, she wanted to know what he was doing up there and he told her he was repairing a bad antenna or some type of faulty wiring, she never requested for him to do this and started getting suspicious about him, eventually she ended up putting her foot down and wanted him out of her life altogether,  but what the guy was really doing was affixing a special video system with cams so that he can watch her showering, and other private matters, she eventually discovers this and has him arrested, I\\'m not exactly sure what the title of the movie was but maybe you might know it.      come back. @Easton Field So are  you are saying we got so use to abusive spousal movies that they are nothing original anymore .  Lol.  Sad , but true . It\\'s called GREED !   Years ago actors would play in the lifetime movies, today you only get no name actors because known actors will not touch a TV movie .  You see a lot of the same actors on LTM as well now . I completely understand the mother\\'s frustration and anger but damn, her poor children didn\\'t deserve to always be shouted at When I was a kid my mom was a single mom and would fly off the handle like this...I used to think I’ll never treat my kids like that. Now as a mom as two teenage boys I get it really life it’s harder than I ever imagined it would be True. However I don\\'t think if you ever shout at your kids then you are automatically a bad mother. I\\'m only a few minutes into this but that woman is supposed to be 67?  I figured 80 - wow.....my mom is 66 and still beautiful. @Jamie Miller No, back in the 80s, 60 year old women looked and dressed more conservatively compared to 60 year old women today. Think of it this way, today\\'s 60 year old grew up in the 60s and 70s where back there they were children of the 30s and 40s She looks older because she either has dementia or Alzheimer’s...my mom has Alzheimer’s and aged 15 years in 18 months it’s horrible It’s the hair style. It looks to be from the olden days. A lot of women don’t change their hair style after a certain age and it dates them. The 80\\'s 60 year old women acted dressed like old women compared to today. Consider Tuesday is a little older than that new. She doesn\\'t look like a dowdy old Granny today. It’s the stereotypical grandma trope. My mom is in her early 70s and doesn’t dress like a old granny. Whenever I see River at this age, I always think of \"Stand By Me\", one of the best movies about friendship ever.  Another one gone too soon.  What might have been . . . . . . . . .. Crying with Gordie. The train scene too Alzheimer\\'s is a terrible disease River Phoenix was in I Love You To Death....Great Movie check it out Yes one.of the best movies I\\'ve matched My favorite is Running on Empty,with Judd Hirsh. Smoke detectors would’ve solved a lot of their problems. @L Rowe a lot of families do this shit too. Not smoking in the frist place would have solved the issue. @Amy Noel Most sleep through anything. Extinguishing it is a start. Especially smoking if you know when you\\'re ready to sleep...is a start. My grandparents did this too. She shuda chewed instead😝 The handsome River Phoenix RIP He was just so beautiful The movie..I Love You To Death he was Great in Gwen Moye yesssss And Geraldine Fitzgerald RIP I thought I recognised him. RIP River Phoenix and Geraldine Fitzgerald CeeCee Williams The Nubian Angel yessss Hard times living with my dad he was a rapist and My Mom knew it My Mom still forced us children to live with my dad the law didn\\'t do anything about it and protected my Dad our justice system is not justice for us children @Delephine firingstoney I sincerely hope they have been punished, people like that should be tortured to death. I’m sorry. That’s disgusting when so called mothers don’t protect their children. Also don’t let anyone invalidate your feelings just because she gave birth to you or he’s your father. My mother has allowed terrible things as well. Mauricio Vasquez  so sorry for what you had to go thru. Mauricio Vasquez gosh, just before the end I got it... thank goodness. I hate when it has to be spelled out for me.  I’m no spring chick 🐣 I truly wish there were more Charlottes out there that have that grasp and healthy brain at her age...it’s not typical. @Delephine firingstoney omg I am soooo sorry ,hope those monsters that hurt you and your lil bro BURN IN HELL.God hates child abusers ,they are demons in the flesh ugh I miss both of my parents dearly Latoya my mom has Alzheimer’s she’s only 67...I feel like she’s gone but not. Me too 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾daddy 1999 🥺 mommy 2015 🥺 grandma 2001 grandpa 2010 🥺🥺🥺 Latoya Ford Me too 👌👆❤ Me too In a childs name with valerie  Burtenelli is my favorite old lmn movie. These writers now a days suck the old lifetime movies are so much better. River Phoenix was so cute He was! That would drive me nuts if someone kept smoking in bed I would probably loose my mind good movie thank you 👍 I agree 2 words for Grandma-SHADY PINES.... Lol lol ok!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 LMAO jenny misteqq that sure is her! Lol 😂😂😂 River was an angel  who died  too soon annd tragically . ..I miss  him  still. What an actor  he would have  become.... @Teresa Linton yes they are brothers where have been?🤪🤯😱🤗😚😎😅😄🤣😂 GOOD LOOKING BOY. VERY GOOD ACTOR @Teresa Linton yes @Nyasia Fagan is joaquin his brother? ShyGurl but also Joaquin too :( Grandma couldn\\'t hear the TV on blast,  but could hear her daughter whispering on the phone from down the hall.  Come on grandma Mmhhmm grandma playing those games That\\'s selective hearing! The grandmother is the one causing her daughter alot of problems in her life, she is a liar, she smokes, then goes to her granddaughter trying to brainwash  her into telling her that she loves her and to please help her by going to her mother and tell her not to put her I\\'m the senior home! So glad the granddaughter stood up for herself and told her no I can\\'t!!  Her daughter was trying her best to help her every way possible and was concerned about her health, don\\'t let the old folks fool ya!! If you never lived with a narcissistic parent/grandmother/husband etc.. you have no idea the hell they put us through!! I have a narcissistic mother and all they leave behind is destruction in the family.  I don\\'t feel sorry for the grandmother she knew what the heck she was doing, causing her daughter sleep deprivation and exhausting her non stop!! Narcissist are very evil! Glad I\\'m no contact!! @Jamie Miller I understand, everyone\\'s story is different, and I\\'m glad you are going to therapy, God bless you. Glenda Ruiz thank you for your kind words I’ve been in therapy and my mom has Alzheimer’s now so is very different in a lot of ways @Jamie Miller Hi I\\'m sorry you also have a narcissistic mother, I know how painful it is and the harm they cause, I hope you went no contact and are doing better, blessings to you. 🙏🌹 Yep my mom was a narcissist Glenda Ruiz u disgrace ! 😡 New lifetime movies equals fake lifetime movies too much technology now and poor actor\\'s all around... When she\\'s not patting down the mother for cigarettes 🤔 she\\'s patting down the son for weed 🤔never a dull moment 😏 @Shank Adams ...you better had preach shank! FACTS!!!!! TO BAD SHE DIDNT PAT DOWN HER MAN A FEW TIMES A WEEK,MAYBE HE WOULDNT HAVE CHEATED😂 I really love older movies they are with nice actors they speak lovely old fashioned...even if i was born late 80\\'s i wish i wasat least teenager in this era much better then today Corona have me watching all these 80’s flicks 😜😜😜 The mom says “$6,000! That’s all you have left after borrowing against your insurance!” \\n\\nAnd then at 37:07 the grandma responds “Oh well I’m sorry about that! Maybe I can arrange to die at $5,999.”\\n\\nLMAO! \\n\\n$300 for one homemade dinner is like $600 in today’s money. That’s insane. This makes sense. One homemade dinner is not $300. That\\'s like a whole shopping trip. @Russell H exactly! Russell H okay yea but if u buy lots of groceries it could cost 300 @Nyasia Fagan one dinner isn\\'t 300!!! Jon M. no it’s not grocery is expensive The grandmother is a toxic narcissist, gaslighting, with dementia on top of it all, toxic.  The daughter didn’t fall from the tree  🙈a mess...most people out here in the world should never have kids 😂 thanks for the reminder Lifetime! This NOT a lifetime movie! Especially if it\\'s a family without Christ Stay away from males too ! I\\'m in love with a person who has passed on. How is this possible? Miss you River.  :( I feel the same about elvis. The actress that plays the grandma also played in the golden girls, Sofia\\'s friend who tried to kill herself. @Jamie Miller yup! XeniasWorld yep\\nShe was going to st olif to visit her dead daughter @RomanySoup yup! And she shaded the heck out of Saint Olaf 😅 @XeniasWorld You\\'re right! She plays an old woman Rose encounters in a bus station who has escaped her nursing home to visit her daughter\\'s grave. @XeniasWorld Yeah, she was the one in the train station off to visit her daughter\\'s grave. She better than me cus ol girl would’ve been in a nursing home. My mom is in a nursing home she has Alzheimer’s and almost burned down my house not\\nTo mention the smoking two packs a day...I tried but i was a horrible care giver Right !! 😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Woman you mean and not girl I wouldn’t want to deal with a mother like that living with me What a good movie..Touched my heart in many ways..I like the old lady and life is hard when men decide they are done with the family they helped create and walk out...What kind of man buys a 2 seater car when he has a wife and 2 kids?!! Lol..only a pathetic worthless one! Somer King Agreed Hana the writer He was a single man who was giving you an obvious indication by buying the 2 seater that you and your child were not a long term part of his life.  He was just too chicken s**t to break up with you, so you had to do the dumping, but by buying that car he was pretty much dumping you without uttering a single word. \\' I really really really 😍  this    old    movie       I    have   not   seen it in   years   thank   you  4   posting   it    god bless you always @Good One 😊👍🏻 Thanks buddy. @Hana the writer Good call Hana! Sneaky little old lady 😉\\nHer and her smokies.... Jon M what would constitute a big deal burning the whole city down lol Grandma had taste though when it came to cooking..gotta give her credit for that! Lol 🌞🙂 Jon M. She burnt her house down with the smokies. It\\'s not a huge deal like this bitch on wheels of a \"mother\" thinks it is. Smoking can be dangerous. Especially when elderly have dementia and forget That Boring Guy I stopped when I found my stepdad dead from heart failure he smokes two packs a day never smoked Yes so true I\\'m a smoker myself, but if the doctor says \"stop\", it\\'s wise to do so. I\\'m thinking of quitting anyway. Michelle Bergeron TRUE ENOUGH POINT WELL STATED River phoenix was in this... Awww One of the first movies to deal with elder parent abuse. @Teresa Linton true my mom is almost 70 and has no grey hair my grandma is elderly she\\'s 94 @Marieh No, they (her friends) knew she was showing signs of dementia and more than likely didn\\'t believe her. After all she just burned her own house down. And she herself abused her children in the exact same way. Then denies it! So I think it\\'s ironic that she\\'s not believed. I\\'m not saying abuse is ever ok, but don\\'t feel more sympathetic towards the geriatric woman than the younger woman. She started the nasty cycle herself. @Linguine Past there is absolutely no excuse for what her daughter did to her. The daughter abused her children and her mother. The fact she was abused as a child is a piss poor excuse for her behavior. The worst thing to happen was what her friends did after she told them. If they were good friends to her they would have made sure she went home with them. @Tara Collins hi.\\nI totally agree with you.\\nThe \\'Elderly\\' are so often seen as the \\'VICTIM\\' , when in most cases, they are the \"ORIGINAL VICTIMISERS &/OR PERPETRATORS OF PHYSICAL/EMOTIONAL VIOLENCE\". THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE. OLD PEOPLE ARE MONSTERS. The grandma is a terrible person. Wow I remember the  Trapper keeper. I always read some comments before eventually wasting my time so here´s mine; agood film, surprising and interesting, exiting and absolutely worth seeing. All she had to do was go sit outside on the porch and smoke... duh I know damn Smarie923 That’s rt But that takes too much effort (sarcasm) She was selfish and stubborn. So glad my mom isn\\'t like her. I know! I could smoke inside, but I don\\'t want all my stuff to stink. It\\'s not difficult to open a damn door! I have empathy for the Mother as well she also needs help but people seem to forget that part I\\'m not making excuses for her and don\\'t like what she was doing to her Mother at all but you have to start at the root of the problem too The Grandmother was also in the wrong I growing my mother was bipolar but high functioning she passed it on to me she would get out hand crazy rants and rages my father never put her in check. Everything was my fault . I refused to give her grandchild my bloodline will die with me I will not pass this to another generation. The commenters here don’t acknowledge that grandmother is narcissist 37:14\\n\"Perhaps I can manage to die after I\\'ve spent $5,999.00\"\\nLmmfao A young river Phoenix. Such a gorgeous human. A sad waste xx Nothing is a waste, lessons can always be learned from others mistakes. I\\'m glad you told us because I thought he looked familiar but didn\\'t know it was River. god rest hes soul god bless him The grandmother was extremely narcissistic. Now I did enjoy the ending, but unfortunately, true narcissists usually do not come around like she did at the end of the movie, and are usually too incorrigible to ever trust or have any kind of relationship with (and no, it didn\\'t give the daughter the right to abuse the mother. It\\'s just that the eldest certainly has the responsibility of breaking the cycle of abuse since they were the adult first!) The long-lost brother they keep talking about, David, was smart to cut ties with his abuser. Unfortunately, instead of replacing his abuser with positive people in his life, it sounds like he ruined it with alcohol instead. Complete Narcissist. And you\\'re right they don\\'t change. Yes thank you, I was looking for a comment that mentioned the old lady being a narcissist. She most definitely was, she was so annoying. That boy dancing! Brilliant! Yessss...I was dancing along with him! I\\'m glad I grew up when I did. The crap on TV and LMN Is horrendous! It\\'s going to get worse in time. Yes 1986 my birth year 😍😘 Raquel Edwards same October 30 This movie was made in 1986 and it\\'s now 2019--33 years later. The \"grandma\" in this movie is playing a woman of 67 yet she looks like today\\'s woman of 87! Look at that hair and her clothes. I\\'m 66, and there\\'s no one I know, at my age, who is anywhere close to moving into \"assisted living\" at 67 or has a granny appearance anything like that---not even close. Women of 67 didn\\'t even look like that in 1986. That gray hair and her hairstyle, not to mention that dress, is more than I can take. How times have changed. And who keeps doilys on a piano? We sing Dirty Diana while MJ grabs his crotch. My mom is 67 and moved into a assisted living home she has Alzheimer’s She\\'s really 73 at this point. This is such a great movie,thanks for uploading,Rest in Peace River...You are missed 🙏 Man what is all the hate with old people you know when they get that age they have put up with so much in their life and in their mind isn\\'t right that\\'s not their fault it\\'s called dementia have some compassion... jeeze @Tewdy Quew you stupid punk that\\'s part of the disease! Filia lucis or its alzeimers. Filia lucis or its alzeimers. I hope I die young. I\\'m already ill and a burden and I\\'m still in my 20s. The Flowers don’t you mean the ‘end’ of life? She can move in with me and cook like that and I\\'ll treat her like a queen for it. As long as she doesn\\'t burn my house down I mean LOL. Duck! Hell yes. People like \"Grandma,\" are the most dangerous! Be careful. Very careful! Both adults needed space and distance from each other. This is such an abusive relationship, no one is healing with them in such close space, getting mad at each other. Yes agree I took a break from my mother and it\\'s done wonders for our relationship. Man I love the old-school lifetime movies I can binge watch them all day but I won\\'t LOL Mom needs to go to a nursing home and get counseling as well as the other family members.  Healing can only start when the deep seeded issues are dealt with on a consistent basis.  So much brokeness from one generation to another. But most people never change no matter what esp not narcissists, sociopaths, physcopaths etc @Teresa Linton understood .....but a nursing home may have been a better resolution than two mentally unhealthy women living together. not everyone wants to go in a nursing home.  wait until your time comes.  I took care of my mom until she was 95. \\'deep seated\\' but same meaning I that River Phoenix.? Yes I loved this movie it was so nice honest and real you can say that again they don\\'t make movies like that anymore Who the heck beats their mother?!?! My childhood was horrible and I tried moving my mom in and I could feel myself getting so angry this was a great portrayal of the passing down of hurt and violence. i identified with this in many ways that i wasn\\'t expecting. my only wish is that my situation turned out in the end the way it did for the mother and the daughter (myself). thanks for the upload :-) Oh no she’s gonna smoke and something is gonna happen That woman is so grumpy no wonder her husband left\\n\\nShe need to find peace inside\\n\\nAnd stop making her family miserable\\n\\nThere is a saying misery love company. Brooke Hill I know right! Lol @lemontea128 LMAO right Shank Adams I guess your mama’s boy. You get your facts elsewhere @lemontea128 b\\'s dont put out your man guna get it else where,FACTS😝 She\\'s horribly grumpy and sour. Ugh. This was a real good movie. Thank you for posting. Great Movie ! And beautiful River Phoenix.. May he rest in Peace .. never forgotten ! The spastic music really scared the grandmother. I agree the music was dreadful! @Becki Green it\\'s an outdated, definitely not acceptable,  word.  It was used to define any and all disabilities in a derogatory tone.  \\nQuite possibly,  the British used it (I\\'m British and I have sad memories of that word.  Yes, I\\'m disabled too!).  \\n\\nMy apologies tho, I\\'ve personalised that term and I\\'m sure Katie didn\\'t have a clue about it\\'s \"history\". Chrissy Moss Calling music “spastic” is insulting and cruel to whom?\\nThe music? @Katie Manglagli I agree with you regarding the volume of the music,  but to call it \"spastic\" is insulting and cruel. @Honey Dip 😂😂😂😂 I think it was punk rock music lol Not that was actually music! I really love the old-school low slung ranch style of that house. @Sonia Rena ... They sure do! me too! Those homes have good bones! I could weep. In the 80\\'s and the decades before, elderly people dressed with dignity. They recognized a special occasion for what it is. I shudder to think about the women my age (40\\'s) who stuff themselves into yoga pants or wear nasty sweatpants in public, and the middle-aged men who dress like overgrown toddlers in shorts and Crocs. God only knows what they\\'ll wear in their golden years. @Mel M Everyone judges people. Maybe not online, but certainly in their minds and fairly likely among their friends. A virtue-signaler is someone who posts this trite if-no-one-spoke-a-single-unkind-word-then-the-world-would-be-all-sunshine-and-rainbows stuff in the hope of receiving \\'Likes\\' on his or her comment and looking virtuous. Kind of like someone uploading dozens of photographs at a charity event when good deeds aren\\'t really supposed to be bragged about (though virtue-signalers are the ones who do it consciously). Look, if no one ever spoke up and we continually ignored the plummeting of dress standards in the name of feminism or fat-positivity or worshiping the God of Comfort above consideration for the special occasion and its hosts and its ambiance, then NO occasion would be special anymore, not even a wedding or job interview. It\\'s not just me. A lot of people are disgusted when they\\'ve saved money for a special night out, only to find the ambiance ruined by slovenly women  wearing skin-tight yoga pants that make MOST people\\'s legs look like stuffed sausages and their butts look like overstuffed peaches (or grown men wearing shorts and ragged sneakers or sagging their pants). A nice linen sundress or khakis are just as comfortable in hot weather, and a pair of nice pants from Ross is cheaper and more classy than wearing gym-appropriate athleisure-wear to dinner out or a plane flight. Just face it. Standards keep slipping, and in this litigious age very few privately owned establishments have the courage to uphold such standards with a dress code. I\\'m not suggesting getting all dolled up for a late-night run to the supermarket, but I believe it\\'s tacky and inconsiderate to others to wear jeans and T-shirts to a Broadway show or a celebration at Maestro. The elderly used to dress appropriately despite the aches that come with age, and even Americans with little income still maintained their \\'Sunday best\\' and looked nicer at church than your average Californian now does when boarding a plane or attending a theater production. pennypay1 wtf does that even mean? You are lame AF . Quit judging people No one likes a virtue-signaler, Mel M. Shut up lol Maybe if we stopped judging others, there would be much less hate in this world. Why do u care if someone “stuffs” themselves into yoga pants!!? Very rude Thanks.. Am having a relaxed Sunday here in Iceland. Binge watching Lifetime Movies.. Love it!! Check out the movie LIFTED 👍. You\\'ll watch it again and again Tuesday Weld, so very pretty and talented! Hell she looked good in Falling Down with Michael Douglas...nice and thick! Woohoo!!!! Avery Pack thanks. She was so pretty. @warialdasue Yes, she is. Still looks good, too. Is she still alive? One married to Dudley Moore tuesday weld is pretty Very and she\\'s aged well. Sad that beautiful inground  pool in not being taken care of and covered . @DRBsGaGa 2909 Pardon my English. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have commented at all. @Hana the writer ? Hana the writer  Wtf are you droning on about? The way she was talking about her and she expected her to not get upset and leave? Bettie Blakey but it\\'s the truth though many people can\\'t handle the truth !! Shows how we repressing things in our hearts never help...until we take them out and let them go...and start new afresh She said they used to boil water add some salt and pepper and that was dinner😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭 foh ain\\'t no way in hell lol My grandpa used to save grease and dip bread in it and eat it growing up in his family. Truly tragic That\\'s just tragic! I lived on onion soup for a while. \\nGot me through my early 20\\'s and saved enough to pay rent for a box room. \\nFrom what I hear in the UK things got far worse recently with families going to food banks and sleeping in terrible conditions. \\nMay you all be blessed and spared the harshness of not having anything IKR!!!😂😂😂 Queen Virgo Queenvirgo 😂🤣🤣🤣 OMG Who cares how old the two actresses really are? It\\'s river\\'s birthday :( he would\\'ve been 50 Ever notice how interactions with the elderly and with one\\'s teenaged kids are identical? \"Tell me what you did with the rest of the cigarettes!\" \\n     \"I told you, I DON\\'T HAVE ANY CIGARETTES!\" Lol 😂😂😂 @********** 😁 Ain\\'t that the truth......Lol @********** 😂😂🤣🤣🤣 ...Once an adult, twice a child.☺️ Gail Yarbrough 😃🇦🇺 Abuse towards the elderly is, sadly, very real in the family home AND in a rising number of care/nursing homes.   In most cases the outcome isn\\'t  as positive as shown in this film.\\nCaring for elderly relatives ought to be seen as \"privilege and a pleasure\". \\n\\nP.S.  :  The lady speaker (who introduced Charlotte) and Charlotte herself,  had beautiful skins.  Their faces were, quite possibly,  flawless! @Krystal Russell I agree with you 100%.  xx @Chrissy Moss It\\'s sad whenever people are forced or kicked out of their own homes as my family was just to have access to medical treatment and proper care and understand neglect is never anything to mess with regardless of any situation it occurs in. @Krystal Russell that\\'s so very sad 😭, but I believe it happens all to often. Elder abuse is illegal but not many understand how to take it into account. My parents abused their parents and their kids especially blaming everyone but theirselves. Very good acting all round. Especially Grandma 😀 lazyman 24/7 I thought I recognised her from somewhere else lol 😂 thank you @lazyman 24/7 Yeah, part 2. isn\\'t she the grandma on poltergiest This was a really good movie worth watching! 👍 indeed. My birthday is day before River Phoenix\\'s death October 30 I just turned 7 years old at the  time I still think about him he\\'d be 50 almost if he was still alive Rip. Grandma need to go, now she\\'s willing to risk killing her family from falling a sleep over and over again with a lit cigarette!  Burned up her own home now almost her daughter home. Kennedy Friendly people do this regardless and that\\'s why safety is difficult my family showed me how dangerous things are. Nostalgic. Love 80s dramas... I\\'ve clocked alot of movies lately and this was a pleasant surprise. River and I were about the same age when Stand by me came out. I had a crush on him. There\\'s a place in my heart ❤️ and a River runs thru it.💖 This version cut out her punching her mother. Good I didn’t want to see it anyway Oh, so that explains it. I was wondering how the grandma ended up with a black eye even though the kids stopped their mom before she hit her. Now I understand. Thanks. Omg really I had a mean ass gran mama. When she got old old she became sweet. It took all my life for her to accept me. She passed at 83. I miss her so much\\n\\nWho is still watching in 2020? tuesday weld was so pretty Enjoying it so far, the grandmother makes me laugh 🤣 Cracking up...😅😅😅😅 Thank you for uploading this gem, they don\\'t make movies like these anymore. Geraldine Fitzgerald & Tuesday Weld WOW! This has made my day 🎥 💎 Isn\\'t that the Grandmother from Poltergeist 2? Yes. I love River sm I don’t know why she’s worried about the grandma spending money on food, she should be happy to be eating “DUCK” and it’s not her money anyway so shut up , she’s an elderly woman now let her live in peace for Christ sake Unfortunately if someone does have or show signs of dementia they should have someone at least help them with their money. Daughter will have to support Grandma when the money runs out .... she’d like to see her mother spending money smartly ..... been there.... Remember dear Granny was abusive to her daughter and son to the point that her son washed his hands of her HIS Footprints OnWater look here, who doesn’t know that already? We all know it, but the daughter didn’t have to react that way, someone doing you a favor by cooking for your monster child and crazy family, show some respect!!! Have compassion considering that the mother is getting ill... “OH COME ON” @Georgia Peach ..irrelevant..she was taken into the daughter\\'s home and has become a dependent in every way including financial...it was stated clearly the combined finances was needed to support her the grandmother didn\\'t have much money left to contribute after she burned down the house because of her selfish irresponsible and dangerous behavior ..the property had been financed to the hilt because of the grandmother\\'s  poor decisions..the daughter was in fact well within her rights to admonish the old woman and be proactive in scrutinizing her financial decisions... Why does the mother act so insensitive towards her daughters guitar? I remember when my brother stepped on my favorite toy and no one cared. Such a same River Phoenix died so young, he was very talented even at a young age. Miss him 💙 Technology...ever changing. State of the art 📺😄 Who would give a thumbs-down to this movie? I cannot stop crying. I loved it! Quite funny 😄 that her memory of abusing her daughter & son as children only came back the min. she overheard she was getting put in a nursing home. 🤔 This is why you don’t abuse your kids ',\n",

The Lie that we are told through racist people like YOURSELF and the media is we are not beautiful, smart and pretty enough which is a lie. We still manage to rise above all that. We are breaking records in Entrepreneurship and earning college degrees. Do to patriarchy some men might be intimidated and want a door mat. Don’t hate us because we’re great. Also, Black women are very picky daters in real life not on tv. We aren’t just gonna grab a man just to have one. We also get approached by a lot of races. Even when I was on the diverse dating sites my inbox was FULL of non Black men. Don’t believe the HYPE. I hope you don’t have any biracial Black daughters with this mentality sheesh. Arthur Johnston What planet are you living on? Everything feminine and beautiful about us is imitated by ALL races and even gay men.

Is it a foreign concept for Black men to stick around and marry the black women they impregnate? On average many White men and other races marry the women they impregnate because they have a sense of pride about family and actually try to be around for their children. Wish I could say the same for the average Black man. But then 70% of them were abandoned by their daddies too so why expect any different from them. But if the woman the Black man impregnates is NOT black he marry that wan with the quickness. @InfoZone Not a foreign concept for black women at all.

We saw how nasty and evil we could be, because of the hurt we both felt. We were close for 3-4 years before we dated, but both of us being very generous and kind gracious people who always were abused and done very dirty by almost everyone in our lives hurt us to the point that we took it out on each other. \\n\\nNow we are strong and doing well together very much in love and harmonic, we don\\'t do things to hurt each other and we work so well together and it\\'s all genuine love. We trust each other and support one another which was a huge issue for us. I never thought it could be fixed after all the failures but love really is more powerful. \\n\\nDon’t repay evil for evil. Don’t retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with a blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and he will grant you his blessing.\\n1Peter3:9 My partner and I went through so much torment and hatred towards each other for over a year straight it was extremely toxic, we were suicidal and doing things to drive the other crazy because we were driven to a loss of hope in humanity so often.

Végre van zenei élménye is a szövegének, ami alapvetően nem rossz. De az autotune meg a csávó mormogása már kibaszott unalmas volt.

Pun intended XD Yes. Well, the Wings of Fire Icewing community is pretty chill. Ohp, if you understand that, no pun intended- me, because that \\'windows community\\' which i\\'m in is full of 11 year old kid just arguing for nothing its boring but here i can have some rest Someone should make an animated series about this raccoon. I am making a comic based of a racoon with similar design to this one Have you watched a single episode of Regular Show?! yeeeEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSSSS Not too sure about that. Chillhop Racoon is like a concept that exists better in our imaginations as something that can chill and mix with our subconscious than something tangible with plots and dialogue. Yes we must...

We would miss you. \\r\\n2. It\\'s not worth the regret. Either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. \\r\\n3. It does get better. Believe it or not, it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. \\r\\n4. There\\'s so much you would miss out on doing. \\r\\n5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. \\r\\n6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. \\r\\n7. You ARE worth it. Don\\'t let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. \\r\\n8. You are amazing. \\r\\n9. A time will come, once you\\'ve battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won\\'t regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. \\r\\n10. What about all the things you\\'ve always wanted to do? What about the things you\\'ve planned, but never got around to doing? You can\\'t do them when you\\'re dead. \\r\\n11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that\\'s still a reason to stay alive. \\r\\n12. You won\\'t be able to listen to music if you die. \\r\\n13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You\\'ll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about. \\r\\n14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me. \\r\\n15.

Let\\'s be honest, we\\'re all confused on why everyone is saying \"let\\'s be honest\" Copied comment!!! How unoriginal. Listen to 16:48 Let\\'s be honest, this comment is stolen I really _need_ that cup which has kept the drink hot for an hour straight. speaking facs I\\'m with you Ember Scott We have Ember cups - they’re brilliant! ☕️ There\\'s actually a fancy, expensive cup called \"Ember\" I\\'ve seen sold at Starbucks stores which can regulate your drink to an exact degree...pretty cool. now that i have read your comment and l looked closer it looks \\nlike its steaming If the artist who drew the raccoon made posters of the different raccoon scenes I would honestly buy all of them and hang them up because he brings me and everybody comfort and gives us all serotonin ✨🦝 Imagine if the raccoon realizes that he/she (idk the gender ;-;) is being recorded and starts screaming autistically. Listening to this as I perfect my college admissions essays\\n\\nWish me luck you lovely chill hoppers I read that as chill poppers, thank you for making me grin during online classes! Luck🦝 @Sully CONGRATS! I got into my first choice of universities!!\\n\\nThank you so much for the support guys!!\\n\\n💙💙💙💙 GOOD LUCK!!! Let\\'s be honest, we all wanna be at the same level of comfort as the raccoon. that raccoon has gone better places and relaxes than any person whose listened to these musics :( True, very true. Uuk UT hi toggling nub numb 🤤😗⚘🤤🤤🤗👩\\u200d🏭 Na dude take a book lay down in bed and read make some tea to go with it and just vibe to this sound see now you\\'re at a good place our time to relax will come. At least I hope so <3 Deaddddd, but That\\'s sooo true yo \"Let\\'s be honest\"  -2020 This type of music is going to start being my first resort when I start feeling a panic/anxiety attack coming. i\\'m so glad i discovered these lofi music video and chill beats before the end of school. they really help me in stressful moments and make me dream about my future, when i will have a diploma and travel the world with a carefree soul.\\n\\n\\nnow it\\'s may, in a month i will have final exams, in this month i have to study hard but it\\'s just a final effort. i can do it even if i\\'m a very lazy and procastination girl lmao. the schoold enden in march due to this corona virus pandemic. we didn\\'t do the last school trip, we didn\\'t celebrate the 100 days to befor the exams (in italy, 100 days before the exams you celebrate with your classmates and have a big party, and we didn\\'t hear the last bell of our last day of school... those would have been the moments that would end your adolescence. btw it doesn\\'t matter, now that i\\'m at home i don\\'t feel so much stress and i can relax and planning the study better. \\n\\n\\n\\ni lived these high school years quite well and have supportive classmates, who helped me a lot. btw i also passed very stressful moments when those damn professors gave us a lot of study but now the bad is passed. in a month i won\\'t be anymore a student, i can\\'t wait for the summer and for not study anymore (especially math, i mean i hate math) but i think maybe in the future, i will miss this moments. i already do that sometimes. expect 4 the study school years are the best! omg it’s passed 1 month since i wrote this comment and now i can finally say i gratuaded! 😍\\nschool is over and now i will finally have my gap year School work at home hasn\\'t been easy, but this playlist has made it easier. Thank you, a lot :) Hang in there! We\\'re all in this together. :) I love that raccoon. He\\'s like a buddy. When I see him, I smile, I feel good. I love where he hangs out, how cozy he seems to often be, the little touches of his life. I\\'ll bet he\\'d be fun to hang with or date. Maybe by watching these, it puts a few coins in his pocket or better. Maybe it\\'s only enough for fare on the metro or the bus or to occasionally go to the coffee shop, but I\\'m glad I can do that much for the guy. *love* Same too Buddy Yeah I need a Raccoon like that in my Life. are you a furry because i am I feel you. Lonely boy hours. this guy actually talked about dating a raccoon have a beautiful day everyone ❤️ aww thx Let\\'s be honest, you\\'re dealing with too much anxiety right now.\\n\\nTake some deep breaths and meditate for the time being Have you got over smoking yet? I saw one of your comments in a vid and you were trying to stop it. btw Gum works too. its actully depression Thank you.  I needed this <3 Listening to this makes me sad - I only rlly used to play lofi when doing homework at this one cafe i live close to and it closed down bc of the pandemic. drinking coffee at home while doing work isn\\'t exactly the same. Studying makes time look endless, but when you actually study time goes like a mf I have a history test tomorrow wish me luck😔!! How did it go Shout out to you if you\\'re in the process of quitting smoking tobacco/vaping nicotine.

We would miss you. \\r\\n2. It\\'s not worth the regret. Either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. \\r\\n3. It does get better. Believe it or not, it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. \\r\\n4. There\\'s so much you would miss out on doing. \\r\\n5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there. \\r\\n6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. \\r\\n7. You ARE worth it. Don\\'t let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. \\r\\n8. You are amazing. \\r\\n9. A time will come, once you\\'ve battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won\\'t regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better. \\r\\n10. What about all the things you\\'ve always wanted to do? What about the things you\\'ve planned, but never got around to doing? You can\\'t do them when you\\'re dead. \\r\\n11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that\\'s still a reason to stay alive. \\r\\n12. You won\\'t be able to listen to music if you die. \\r\\n13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You\\'ll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about. \\r\\n14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me. \\r\\n15.

I want you to know something. You are loved. I know some people might make you feel like that\\'s not true but it is. And it\\'s ok to feel worthless sometimes. But that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s true. You are here for a reason. Now, you might not know what that reason is yet. Most people don\\'t know until they\\'re old. And that\\'s ok. It\\'s ok to feel lost. It\\'s normal. But remember. Being lost doesn\\'t mean you\\'ve failed. It just means you took a new path. You aren\\'t lost. You\\'re forging a new way through life. Be bold, be brave, be kind, be strong. You are important and it\\'s ok to feel. Sad, happy, angry. Whatever. It\\'s ok to feel. And in the immortal words of J.R.R Tolkein \"I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.\" Have a good day, little explorer. I hope you find what you\\'re looking for Thank you, Maya. melhor q eu já vi Last day of sophmore year!!! Yyayy\\nCheers to everyone and I hope this school year went well. May it be even better next year<3 Let’s be honest everyone is saying Let’s be honest😁 I have online school in 42 minutes so I\\'m spending that time here:) anyone got a link to background image? I wanna use it as my wallpaper Take a screenshot. Crop it. And use it as a wallpaper no sry,but i would like it too I\\'m not a student... unless you count life lol but I love the vibe and the little world you create! For someone with anxiety your channel is medicine for the soul. Ty 💜 Y\\'all realize that ain\\'t no ornery Racoon, ¿right? Word. U know what funny I\\'m just now reading ur comment\\nAnd I agree my name Ty as well and I suffer from depression and a little anxiety they say everything mild but I feel free when I listein to this the man I wish I was that raccoon just chilling and nothing to do life great all a dream but in reality I wish u and me can hang on and keep moving forward Yes!! I agree. I wish i\\'d thought to look up this type of music or station several years ago when i was going through some stressful and anxious times. I didn\\'t realize that the music i was listening to, while good music that i really like, was just too sad and dramatic for my state of mind at the time, and it just exacerbated my stress and anxiety. Low fi, chill music would have changed my whole state of mind and helped me to feel more calm and centered, and thus make better decisions, rather than doing impulsive things i now regret years later. Now i know that if i\\'m feeling anxious or stressed, i need to make sure i\\'m eating a healthy diet, getting cardio exercise, the right vitamins, practicing mindfulness and some daily meditation, but also pay attention to what i\\'m listening to, and see if what\\'s coming through my headphones is aiding in anxiety or depression or alleviating it. I legit just found out Chillhop doesn\\'t have merch. Update; nvm I just found out they do lol Here because Dermot Kennedy posted it in a story <3 the art in this vid is amazing\\ntake the truth yall i love all of jeremy\\'s illustrations just as much as these mixes. something about the music and the artwork just makes me happy. much love chillhop -p i spent 12 minutes reading the comments... oh right, the book! I haven\\'t slept in two days because of school and I just keep listening to lo-fi Hope everything is okay. Hang in there, and try as best you can to get your schedule back on track! I’m actually reading to this, but I use it to study too 📖 I’m thinking, is the raccoon just chilling to read while waiting for red panda? this character is so cute. i study happily while i\\'m listening to this <3 vibes, hope your doing well where ever you are now my friend @spongebobmx I\\'ve always thought the cute lil raccoon was a male, but maybe I\\'m wrong \\u200b@akira dwias QQ is he a she or a he? Cuz I sometimes refer it as a he when it may be a she .... \\nI named him Chato the Racoon, and it is studying philosophy, but it is also fascinated by coding and nature. ich auch :3 c m a m o I had to stop studying to appreciate that sax 🎷💕 17:30 Heyy you know it\\'s on Chillhop\\'s playlist on SoundCloud and the name of the playlist is \"Self Reflection-Less.People\" with a dude lying in the grass and the song is \"what will you do?\" , I think it\\'s the first song <3 <3 <3 <3 The raccoon is sleeping I’m so happy this exists,I have finished my homework because of this It\\'s only me who can\\'t concentrate even after listening this music.....lol my concentration powers and memory is so poor😢😧😧😧😧 gotta finish a five page essay in five hours Let\\'s be honest here, we\\'re all here for the raccoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n...and the awesome beats we all are listening to this while doing online school. :( ',\n",

Tru tru *s franco kasspari erre This is why somehow YouTube is sometimes better than school. hey my hero ,bear in mind you are helping students who are in Somalia where there is no functional government and also cant get a great teachers like you but  when I see people like you helping me and my classmates without money that really  reminds us that we still have great heroes giving us a bright future .thank you my hero @Natural man look I will help you understand . China when they decided to have one child policy had a population of 970 million ( 520 million away from indian population) and during that time India had a population of 450 million . India did not enforce major birth reduction laws . But china did. Now if we were to go with your logic and assume that they didn\\'t enforce their one child policy. Then china should be around 500 million people ahead of India . But that is not the case china is currently tied with India and estimates indicate india will soon overtake China\\'s population. @Aman Shankar \\nclearly not! then how and why their population continued to grow?\\nhum @Aman Shankar \\noh now you are saying China faces economic difficulties?\\nwell, why is that?\\nthey didn\\'t stop producing babies.  they kept growing in population now there are one and half billion of them. Are you saying that is bad?\\nwell why?\\ni thought you said population growth  is a good thing? so why is it bad now?\\nso you are lost!  you have no clue! you just proved me right without knowing. @Natural man what do you mean \"more and more\" china was highly effective with their policy. Forcefully aborting pregnancies and sterilizing women. @Aman Shankar \\nno you have no clue.\\nclearly the government forcing the people didn\\'t work because people didn\\'t want to bring only one child, they wanted to bring more and more.\\nBecause of people like you that are against one child policy. Who is cramming last minute for a test? @zahra \"exam\" -- you know you\\'re about to be thrown into the forge when it\\'s called this. This is me I have until next Tuesday for my exam and I have been doing these zoom classes without much effort so time to catch up 😁😁 @eg nogg Last minute because I procrastinated so badly that I am using the last few minutes of school to watch as much as I can. how is that last minute the video is three hours long Dr Bhagwat Dandotiya k. Z \\nWajing of universal knowledge ok. Going to start watching all 252 videos in this playlist for my chem class. Will let you know when I am done. :) Have you finished? @kines slop Funny how this Tony joined YT 1 month ago @Tony Nguyen funny how his account was made 1 month ago @animesh pandayou can find all of organic chemistry video playlists here https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOrganicChemistryTutor/playlists @Tony Nguyen oh my man is back I am a chem teacher and am relying on your videos during covid-19.  Your site is the only one I have found to explain the material the way I do with the same depth of content and accurate.  Thanks you for helping me and my students make this transition to online distance learning smooth and mostly painless.  \\n\\n\\nIn addition, since I have found you to be such an excellent instructor (and parents and kids clash at times), I have you \"teach\" my 8 year old (2nd grade) multiplying and dividing fractions.  I then act as his tutor to explain concepts (such as negative numbers) that you introduce and clear up his confusion.  I find it works out so much better this way, because when I am both teacher and tutor to him his frustration level rises rapidly when he does not grasp a concept immediately. He deserves so many more likes by far. @That one dude he needs to feed his children as well That one dude a whole lot lol @That one dude tf how is that relevent Do you realize how many ads are in this video Astotrack Plays\\n True story This is the kind of stuff that got me through school most of last year. This channel is way better at explaining than teachers I had great teachers in since grade school. If you asked questions of them they had answers.  It was that the curriculum they had to cover ran them short on time. \\nI’m just here brushing up to help my daughter when she receives the new periodic table I ordered for her. ;-) Bruh, most teachers shouldn\\'t even be in a position to teach... This guy tho.... He knows how to teach... fizz peters so true! This guy is pretty good. He doesn’t miss a single detail. There is nothing this channel doesn\\'t have, I studied for AP Calculus, AP Physics C Mech and Electronics and now for my university chem placement test with this channel and I have no idea how to thank you for this! You are literally saving lives with your videos! I can\\'t be more greatful for anything than your videos. Thank you so so so  much You teach me in 3 hours what my teacher taught me in 1 year Learning this chemistry lifestyle so I can have a clue to what my 10 year old son who wants to be a Chemist is talking about...\\n@keithdevore that\\'s cute aww Learning this chemistry lifestyle because I was too lazy to back in the day. Aww♥️ Aww you\\'re a good parent. I hope your sons dream comes true. When I took Chemistry in college, the teacher started talking about atomic shells.  There is no Physics here. Joseph Nicholas sir I don’t understand?? I fell asleep listening to Spotify and I wake up to being an hour and 2 minutes into this. Wtf Consider yourself blessed Daniel Labinjo lmao Learning chem in your sleep lol Thank you very much sir, you have been improving our knowledge by uploading these videos... by sharing your knowledge with us. @The Organic Chemistry Tutor sir I am a 18 years little student of chemistry. I belongs to a lower middle class family. I creat a new chanel for earn some money for continuing my study. Can u help me plz by some good advice. Then I and my mother take dua for u near allah You\\'re very welcome I fell asleep with my YouTube playing and woke up to see I’m 2:03:52 minutes into this. I woke up reciting elements ah ah ah ah ah ah Yeyy I finished this video in 1 day..\\nTHANK YOU😘\\n\\n\\nWish me luck guys for upcoming gr.12 exams and college entrance exams!! GODBLESS 💕 You don\\'t know how many times you save my life especially that I missed most classes in chemistry  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ much love and appreciate for your GREAT work 😍 fell asleep, let autoplay run, woke up an hour and and a half into this. enjoy the ad revenue dude 😳 You\\'re giving us this more important knowledge without any fee  in a way that our teacher\\'s can\\'t,  what is your secret ? U DESERVE A STANDING OVATION FOR TEACHING STUDENTS IN SUCH A NICE WAY. The chemical element below Iodine is \"Astatine\" At -- it shouldn\\'t be confused with Arsenic As with is a poisonous compound sharing a room sucks I\\'m trying to learn and my sister is watching Rupaul\\'s Drag Race next to me on the loudest volume Oh, put on headphones then. Same here, actually. If you were my room mate you wouldn\\'t even know I\\'m there Why didn\\'t I know about you at the beginning of the semester?!?! Just Viewer on the Internet * In the internet , no one cares about grammar .. @Grargle Jobber shut up low IQ white homeless man @John Negron lmao @Hannah H >whomst\\nlmao why do idiots believe that covering up their stupidity with grammar they don\\'t even understand will fool anybody but people dumber than them lmao What an amazing video. Can you create subtitle that includes in this video, sometimes I don\\'t know the word or academic vocabulary about chemistry that sometimes hard to understand? Thanks a lot. Why don\\'t you just turn closed caption on? I am studying for my exam and I found this wonderful lecture!!! He is amazing!!! Thank you!!! Narrator: \"Pause the video if you need to.\"\\nMe: \"No need. It\\'s GONE.\" Fell asleep listening to music now and I’m 2 hours into this video. Nice. 2:25:13 it\\'s rather m=n/M (g=mol/(mol/g))\\nBesides that I\\'d like to thank you, I needed to refresh my memory bcz I didn\\'t have chemistry for a year and I\\'m supposed to be on a second year college level now 🙄 But I forgot everything 😅 I just want to take the time and appreciate how your background is black and not white🤗. It’s so much nicer for the eyes Oh Man ! This is awesome ! I should have started my MCAT prep with this video ! Thanks for your time to do such a detailed video, I appreciate the effort ! Nice work Sir 👍...\\n\\nI like the concept of \"typical exam\" question scenario  been applied as you go the topics 👌\\n\\nThis is a good 3 hour refresher which all students should look at. I am so thankful that youd taught us to solve math and science,  thank you so much for helping us hope that you may post more videos..it really helps me to do more calculus ang chemistry,  your a hero😊😊 God Bless Okay, maybe it\\'s the tiredness... but at 58:05 I started singing  \"Isn\\'t it Ionic... Don\\'tcha think? ... it\\'s like Ra-a-ain.....\"\\n\\nI should sleep : / 1 semester of material in 3 hours thx saved my grade @Beatriz Samano It\\'s a big topic take it in parts Thank you I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question. I am very confused with this subject but refuse to give up. So I’ll watch this video in its entirety and take notes and write down any questions so I can further research. Thank you again. @Beatriz Samano if u are confused just keep on looking for videos or websites. or you can ask friends @Beatriz Samano yes this video helped me a lot. i got a high grade in my chemistry class because i chose to watch this video. i did have previous understanding in chemistry but this video helped me further reinforce my understanding anonymous person Did this video truly help anyone out there get a better understanding of chemistry? I mean enough understanding to keep moving forward with the class and pass it? I’m seriously so freaking confused in mine 😫😫 I have lost a year\\'s worth of chemistry and I\\'m sad. Hope this video helps me. I love your videos, you show the relationship- the chemistry! may the universe bless you with your kindness man... I owe you big time....I watch your tutorials and it helped me a lot like a lot haha..I just wish I\\'ve known this channel sooner tho haha...thanks for sharing your knowledge man really appreciate it...#respect THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME!!!!!!! YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT HELP TO EVERYONE!! BLESS YOUR SOUL!!!!!! Thank you for this video. I\\'m going to university in the fall and I watched this entire video to prepare for my chemistry placement test. I passed! thank youu :) Crazy how I’m like the 1% learning this out of pure interest and hobby Me too! Same here Lmao me too!! Too many advertisements to study!!!! THANKYOU SO MUCH😭😭😭😭 UR CHANNEL NEEDS TO BE SEEN! I just got home from my intro to chem class and was very disappointed and want to drop the class now. I can tell I\\'m going to have a hard time dealing with my chem professors lectures. Not to mention she has an Indian accent. I have nothing against Indians but I need to be able to follow my professors lectures and not be bored to death. Oh no the heavy Indian accent, I feel your pain. As hard as I try, can barely get pass by it. Well hang in there, because in the meantime you can have the organic chemistry tutor be your professor :) please do a video on \"The relationship btw Equilibrium Constants (Kc, Kp, Kx, Kn)\" I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my hypothalamus! I learn every day with your videos accompanied with reading my textbooks. NMAT (or MCAT) is on October 21 and I\\'m so glad I found this channel 🙌 At 1:50:28 I literally wrote on my notes \"Flouride\" and then he suddenly said \"u comes before the o\" as if correcting me oh my god you better be getting paid good for this BECAUSE THERE ARE 45 ADS 🤯🤯 Haha yeah exactly, I couldn\\'t help but feel baffled when I opened the vid and saw the yellow dotted line... Natasha Swann, hello! Hit me up for ad free movies and dinners in Austin Tx I thought this video said 3 minutes and I was like \\nHOW MANY MID ROLE ADS ARE THERE!? started watching breaking bad.\\n\\n\\nwatching this for scientific purposes. Gent put a million ad\\'s in this video. 🤣🤣 Love your stuff, really helped me! Played this while I slept\\n\\n\\nI didn’t learn anything...... I just skip ended the video and all ads disappear 😂😂😂😂 You really helped me in alot of subjects physics math and this year im having chemistry tysm😌 What a great review of the chemistry I kind of learned years ago but it is easier with this guy explaining it! i laughed so hard when the thought of him forgeting to hit record poped in my head Thank you Mr. ( I don\\'t know your name) but really thanks , not only for this video but for every single video in each subject. I relived elementary math, Jr Hs science, HS Chemistry, and Jr. College Chemistry.  WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWO THE MR BEAST ADS Me here after watching dr.stone and in the same time want to prepare myself to master degree \\nThank you so much 💛 hello there fellow weeb :3 5 Minutes in and have covered like 4 days of learning. One thing about online video content is that you can pause and play since someone like me likes to write down everything and this person does an excellent job of explaining so I have things to write down. Already at 2 and one-half page notes so far. The future of education @thefilthygamer lol I hope not with 45 ads You are so wonderful. Your presentation is very helpful 🙏 Going back to college this year after 4 years of being out of school. need to learn Chemistry, never took it in high school (not very smart nor did I have the same career path in mind) Thank you so much for doing this. Every one here is counting there blessings to this guy and I just wanted to understand the show doctor stone I am thinking about taking a chemistry course. you are welcome also to watch AP chemistry course to learn chemistry Oh and the book is the fifth edition by Peter Atkins The Organic Chemistry Tutor , do you know if chemical prin the quest for insight is good for someone who took chem in ha but forgot most of it, fyi I\\'m taking this mit online class and why I got this book, I\\'m getting ahead to take gen chem in the fall The Organic Chemistry Tutor I will Study ahead of time. going to watch every single video, ill let u guys know when iam done Any update? How far did you go im 12 years old i dont know what he is sayiny ots vry hard please tell me \"One meter is about a hundred centimeters\" ahahaha. I\\'n not hating, this guy definitely helped me out but that was pretty funny. 😂😂😂😂 Did this video truly help anyone out there get a better understanding of chemistry? I mean enough understanding to keep moving forward with the class and pass it? I’m seriously so freaking confused in mine 😫😫 Honestly I don’t understand anything said here, I’m not even close to this grade level yet, but it is incredibly interesting. IKR XD ive been with this guy since the 11th grade. now im in uni and forgot everything for my chem 201 class. coming back here for review cuz hes the only one i can depend on. Who actually watched the 200 something videos? Asking for a friend :) What would I do without you :( thank you so much I hate chemistry but I think is not chemistry is actually my instructor that don\\'t teach us anything just want exams to be done period. I am gonna try to finish this whole playlist for my chem class. Will update you Oh, good luck! Very helpful, I’m taking chemistry in September Hey, organic chemistry tutor! I think you should start selling merch. I would totally buy some, as you have helped me so much in my math and chem classes. Keep it up! My professor doesn’t know how to teach like he does😪 I wish he was my professor 👨\\u200d🏫 wow!. 3 hours full of chemistry essentials. thank you for sharing this.. I know you have helped a lot of students having hard time with studying the basics. Here for review because u actually need this later in life when u forget Im here cause im failling chem.i need all the help i can get Hope you succeed because I don\\'t want anyone to fail like i did. Just picked a random video to comment and tell you this - Thank you!\\nWith your videos around I feel safe and pretty confident. Every time I search for a certain topic and find one of your videos, I know for sure that with little motivation and discipline I\\'ll eventually grasp it extremelly well!\\nI am pretty sure that almost every person who got here and reading this thinks the same as well\\n\\n\\nWe are greatful for your work!!!!! I pSt pit watching something and this was something I watched in my sleep. Wish my Chemistry teacher was so concise and clear. Damn, this dude is a legend.  Great content! l could not comment on your fraction videos...so l had to show love here!!! thank u so much! u keep it simple!!🙌🙌🙌🙌❤❤❤ I am sorry! It\\'s me again.\\nDo you also have some videos about the topics \"Technical Chemistry\" and \"Physical Chemistry\" and Quantum Mechanics? So like the first ones on the left have a few extra in electrons while the right side elements kind of want a few or just spectate fine too eh Ever since I have transfer in  WIS it has really been   a  challenge  for me especially in science  class but with  the help  of the internet and  you tube  it made learning more fun  than i have ever imagined. Wow.  An ad every four minutes.  I\\'m getting a repetitive stress injury from skipping them all. I can\\'t thank you enough!  I\\'m deathly close to my exams with little to no idea where to even begin with chemistry but this is so helpful! Ha I was like this is going to be boring. I’ll watch 5 minutes. I watched the whole thing.😳😳 Thank You for all your help, sincerely sincerely! you deserve all the success in the world and hope your work is appreciated around the world. Just keeping a bookmark here:\\n27:36 I am 3 years old, how i find myself here...i dont understand....wao thanks for this great knowledge.... Now i can kill my teacher with questions I getting the hang of it now. Mr. Luis will think I was cheating on the quiz i just turned in~ Wish I had found this video last year :’( Thank you from Jamaica 🇯🇲 ',\n",
       " 'can we just apreciate, how damn ORGANISED her scraps are?? Mine are just chaos in a box 😅😅 I know mine are just thrown everywhere Mine are in a huge pile beside my couch because honestly there is no other space for it Recently got my scraps sorted.\\n\\n1)Scraps for stuffing. Pieces much to small or projects so ugly they get buried in here. Be sure to cut up project failures so you don\\'t try to resurrect them. Make pin cushions, ironing ham, old-fashioned dolls, and whatever. \\n\\n2) Scraps gifted to me. So I don\\'t forget who to thank when project completed successfully. It makes me feel good when someone is beaming with pride while showing off something made with materials I gave them. And vice versa.\\n\\n3) Small scraps for small projects or small patches or appliqué.\\n\\n4) Strips and straps. This includes elastic or cording cut wrong size for the project. Fabric long but only wide enough for trim. \\n\\n5) Big scraps. Too big to throw away. Size is useful for mix and match up projects. And making small things like small drawstring bags. Can Never have enough boxes or bags for sewing stuff.\\n\\n6) Give away. It\\'s never too early to start gathering up a fabric bundle for someone that sews for birthdays, Christmas, and etc. Or you can donate to a charity that makes quilts from fabric donations. Or you can make small quilts to donate to a local animal shelter. I was thinking that also Mine are in a box or a bag or just all over mixed up I imagine scrap fabric to look very different from whole neat squares and stuff sedmihra You could Just sew a bunch of scraps together to make a bigger piece and then use that to make cool and unique stuff @The History Rescuer when I make a new project I started cutting my scraps into whatever regular shape I could-- squares or rectangles-- so they\\'re ready to be used later. ashhhlgh Woah! Didn\\'t know that was possible!! @RocAce exactly I know! My scrap fabrics are the pieces she cuts off This quilt idea reminded of a friend whose Mom made clothes for her all the years she was growing up and saved pieces from each outfit in her cedar chest.  When my friend was expecting her first child, her Mom got out the scraps and pieced a crib quilt for the new baby.  It was exciting to see when she unwrapped the quilt and remembered so many of the pieces, the Easter dress, the dress for Grandma\\'s birthday party etc.  What a wonderful trip down memory lane  that was for both of them.  Just an idea for some of your young dress makers out there. Oh wow that’s so lovely! What a great idea 😍 I can\\'t sew but i\\'m here for aesthetics. Anyone else with me? 😅 No I hate aEsThEtIc its stupid @Paige Baizei have  no idea how to see straight. I kinda know how to sew but I’m horrible I can sew 🧵 but I am also here for esthetics. You can learn I\\'m currently stuck at home during the quarantine in Italy. I had scheduled my first sewing lesson next Saturday but it got canceled since every non essential activity is being shut down, so I\\'m kinda sad and looking for cute sewing projects to do with what I currently have. I already made a couple of comfy sweaters. I will try some of these as well! How long have you been quarantined....are you going stir crazy Her Serena! I recently taught myself how to sew using classes on MyBluPrint.com! I recommend it! Ciao! I\\'m also from Italy and I\\'m getting into sewing during this quarantine. I find these videos really helpful! Serena I’m not an expert but I’ve been making some dresses lately.  When I first started I made aprons and placemats. 25 years later I’m still using them.  I’ve reclaimed an apron that I made as gift to my sister over 20 years ago. I’m so sorry to hear that Serena, hopefully they will reschedule your lesson when all this craziness is over! Lovely to hear you’re using the time to make yourself some nice things. Stay safe! Xx Use this time stamps:\\n\\n1. Mis-matched napkins 0:47\\n2. Contrasting pockets 1:44\\n3. \\'BE NICE\\' wall art 3:15\\n4. Scrunchies 5:55\\n5. Hexagon quilt 7:32\\n6. Fabric bundles 9:43 This is also in the description at the top lol Watching you sewing made me realise how poor my sewing skills are.... watching you ironing makes me realise how poor my ironing skills are.... 😳😅\\nYeahhhhhh !!! I’d better start playing tennis.. please don’t ever make any video where you play tennis please \\nThanks\\nI love the scrunches by the way \\nYou’re great 👍🏼 Hahaha trust me, this is all I’m good at 😂😂 *when you just collect/harvest fabrics from old clothing*\\n\"h-how can i have usable scraps??\" ik with clothing I really have to use every last inch 😭 I love the contrasting pockets! 😄🧡 The ideas for a hexagon \"memory quilt\" from your project scraps is wonderfully sentimental. Xoxox\\nThe gift of fabric is a lovely idea too. Steph Krunic. The best ways to get good hexagons is to use a paper base so they are the same uniform shape. But that\\'s hand sewing and so so painful. But just look at \\'English Paper Piecing\\' if you need instructions. Thank you 🧡 The last one is literally just \"Don\\'t want your scraps? Make them someone else\\'s problem!\"\\nNo hate, though. This video is adorable. I think it works best when you have a lot of leftover fabric from a big project, say, a dress. So you already have a dress of this pattern, and a napkin, and some quilt pieces, and a doll\\'s outfit, and you STILL have some scraps left. And this is when they should go to a new home :D\\nHappens to me all the time, thankfully I have a couple of friends in the doll collecting community who gladly accept my scraps and exchange theirs. Otherwise I\\'d have all my apartment covered in blue velvet after this particular cosplay dress. M Chang honestly I’d be happy to receive such aesthetic fabrics aha Your scrap fabric collection is so aesthetic! I look at my pile and it feels so lackluster. I\\'m still super excited to try the scrunchie and quilting with what I do have though! Gonna try a denim scrunchie..i love scunchies😊 It’s probably because I’m always drawn to the same colour palette when I’m fabric shopping 🙄😂 Have fun using your scraps! This ladies’ way of “scraps” is making-a-dress scrap. Love the pocket project. Looking at a dress right now and thinking hmmmm🤔. And definitely have to make the scrunchies!\\n\\nThanks Janelle! Yay have fun making these projects for yourself 😄💕 in nz we are in quarantine for about 1 month so I’m trying to find thing to do and I am definitely going to try all these things ☺️ I think Aus will be in the same situation soon enough... Have fun sewing some nice things for yourself during this crazy time! Sending love xx please don\\'t gift your scraps to \"a sewing friend\", I\\'m drowning!! 😂 I wish I had such beautiful scraps... <3 Me to my scraps aren\\'t pretty Thank you so much that you instead of just give the measurements in inches also Such good ideas now that people have to stay in! I would like to see a tutorial on how to make some clothes 😻like from scratch There are heaps up on my channel already, and I’m always working on more 😍 This video is so well-made! You right don’t feel like shopping like fabric at the moment . Online isn’t the same I brought what I really needed but it was just a solid colour to finish a project . I love the quilt idea!!! 🤗🤗🤗 your videos are always brilliant! So many projects to start during this crazy time! Thank you janelle!!☺️ Thanks so much! Glad you like them 😄💕 Can we just talk about how cute that outfit is 😅 In other news, I didn\\'t have vlisofix conveniently lying around my house, but spray-on adhesive worked a charm! Good to know 😄 I love it so much that you tell us the centimeter AND inches ! As a German we only use centimeters. I always have to Google what inch length is in cm. I don\\'t know  but this makes me so happy! Thank you 🌼🌼 All of my scrap fabric look so bad next to each other, yet yours match 😂 Haha I had a lot to choose from! That helps!! 🙈 I\\' m a sewing begginer and I love those ideas! Love the pocket idea. Easiest to do scrunchies I\\'ve found so far. Thanks for sharing your creativity. I have wanted to learn to sew scrunchies great info You’re welcome! Glad you’ve found these videos helpful 😄 I love your contrasting pockets!  I have a couple of garments that could do with pockets so will give this a try.  Thank you!\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m so happy to see someone use pins the way I do.  So many You Tube clips drive me crazy when I see pins inserted along a stitching line instead of adjacent to it so you can just keep sewing :-) I seen my husband\\'s own original safari suit. He looks so handsome esp5eith his thick long white socks and coke bottle glasses😍 Me: can\\'t sew to save my life\\nAlso me: ah yes great projects to do Perfect been staying in because of the coronavirus so I will be sewing a lot! Good idea so stay inside and sew 😊 I’ve been sewing pjs bottoms and dresses and a quilt You absolutely do not need an over locking machine to do any sewing by the way. This this this! I used to be so put off because I didn\\'t have an overlocker. Look into Bernadette Banner to find out some historical sewing including how to sew easy and strong seams with no machine at all! this is so soothing :,,,,) thank you for your lovely videos! You’re welcome! 🧡😊 I fell in love with the floral print so sad I cannot get a hold of it in the US 😭😅 Nancy Garcia Interesting because I love buying fabric in Virginia when I am USA, fabric in France, buttons and crochet cottons in Spain/ Portugal. Nancy Garcia you can, there are very pretty floral fabrics in America you just have to look for it Hopefully you can find something similar instead! 🧡 Girl, you read my mind. I\\'m starting a quilt today! Thank you ;) Aww lovely! Have fun making it 😍 The \\'be nice\\' wall art is me before I go out the house telling myself not to be rude to people Love these ideas. I am going to make the mixed matched napkins - brilliant 😊 Yay have fun making them 😍 I love these! are there any sewing projects you recommend that don’t require a sewing machine? Thanks! Just as the sewing garden said, these can all be done by hand sewing too 😊 Joy Lee You could make those cute cloth napkins by cutting the large squares either with pinking shears, if you have them, and letting them fray over time. Or, you could pull out several threads from each side of the napkin so that there is a real frayed edge. It will hold up fine through many washings. You just have to make sure you are using all cotton or all linen if you are pulling out threads because those come out easier than if you’re using a man made fabric that has polyester, nylon, rayon, etc. in it. Also, those scrunchies (and really all the projects) can be done by hand sewing them. They may take a bit longer, but they will work great! Love the concept and projects of this video! Please do morw like this😍 Thank you! 😊🧡 Love the contrasting pockets! Thank you! 💕 Love the color scheme of these scraps! very satisfying. and great ideas! thanks. Love these ideas! I have a stack of scrap fabric I can put to use now :) your channel is awesome, keep up the great content ♥️ Thanks so much 🧡 Great ideas to help keep our crafty hands busy while we have to kinda stay home etc!  I have a hexie little ruler guy ,you\\'ve inspired me to pull him out and give him a go . Always fun to watch as always Janell . Stay healthy 😊 Thanks Amanda! Those hexagon rulers are such a good idea. Hope you start making a lovely quilt of your own 🧡 Such a great bunch of ideas, I can’t wait to try these out! Thanks Janelle 😌 You’re welcome 😄🧡 I love the colours! I can\\'t wait to add contrasting pockets to a project when I get good enough to make clothes :) Really appreciate you saying both centimeter and inch measurements!🥰 I always make scrunchies with my scraps so it’s nice to see something new to try Oh the contrasting pockets! I think I have some shorts to tear apart and put pockets in them! Yay do it 😍 Thank you so much for the pockets !! It will save me a lot of time. You’re welcome 🧡 What fun projects and perfect way to use up fabric scraps.  Hope you, your husband,  family and friends stay safe and healthy. Thanks lovely! You too 😘 Lovely projects! I never would have thought of the cute pockets. I love your channel. Keep these sweet videos coming!! Thank you! 💕 And masks for hospitals! :) That’s an amazing idea!! Wow! Thank you for this! 😍 You’re welcome 🧡 I like your quilt you are doing there am i your friend lol sorry i missed this video love it i am doing the 2 1/2 inch squares into a 4 patch then sashing and a corner stone from Newfoundland Canada Happy Easter dear lady Sunday Apr. 12 Nice to see you Janelle. Hope you stay well. Thanks for sharing this scrappy project video 🌸🌿 Great ideas Janelle! I think im going to combine 2 and make a scrap quilt/wall hanging out of all my future makes!! ❤ That’s a beautiful idea 😍 Thanks love xx Definitely will be trying these out! Where do you get your fabric? Such pretty designs I love them!! Most of them are either from the op-shop or Spotlight 😊 Love your aesthetic and amazing video ❤️ Thank you so much 🧡 I\\'m a beginner sewer and I\\'m so grateful for your videos! Thanks for sharing these little projects, will have them saved if I have to self isolate! Or even if I don\\'t, they\\'d be an ideal way to spend an afternoon! Hope you are keeping safe, well, and healthy x So true! Have fun making them 😊💕 These are all really unique scrap busters, thank you! Thanks! You’re welcome 🧡 I love the quilt idea and I\\'m so excited to start that project. Thank you for sharing such great ideas. You’re so welcome! Have fun making your quilt 🧡 About to go sew pockets on everything I own... Scraps oh my goodness piles n piles of those  lol lol ty for sharring (smiles) You could also put a whole rubber band in it then sow it up instead of making one. It’s the same steps essentially. Cut fold sew band sew\\nYour just making it a loop. Putting the band on, and finishing. I think you should definitely use this time to make more videos 😘 this is so great! thanks for the ideas You’re welcome 🧡 No time like this to destash! Thanks for the inspiration! You’re welcome 😊 Hi there — Love this video and the creative ideas! I was curious to what sewing machine you are using? Thanks so much! I have a Brother NS30 😊 that method of doing pockets is,,, so much easier than what i\\'ve been doing???? i love these ideas! i mostly buy fabric from used art supply stores, so I do a lot of small scrap projects :) Yay glad you found the video helpful 😄 So cool! Particularly love the last one. It\\'s like \"Still not sure what to do with your scraps? Make them someone else\\'s problem!!\" in the most positive and helpful way :) Love this! So much compact content Thank you 🧡 What lovely ideas I just shared my first sewing project on my channel so I don’t have much scrap fabric yet but I love the idea of using these bits instead of letting them go to waste xx Totally! I can never throw fabric out. I know I’ll use it eventually 😄 I make my scrunching different but I will definitely try this method! Loved all the ideas. I\\'ll try making them😊 queen these are so cute...thank u! You’re welcome! 😄🧡 I\\'m new using a sewing machine,  just started making face masks, loved your video!!!! I have a technical question: my top thread keeps cutting from the needle very often, what am I doing wrong? What kind of sewing machine do you have? It looks very nice, thanx Thanks so much! I have the Brother NS30 😊 Loved all these ideas 😍 great video lovely x Thank you 😘 Thanks just today i need this motivation ! !!!!!!😉😆☺ What a nice idea ... the bundle of scraps. Love your projects. My first time here. I have been given some pretty antique linen embroidered napkins but I feel like I’ll never use them for that purpose. (I just got married and we’re remodeling our house so we don’t have too much use for that type of stuff right now plus I got a ton of modern farmhouse dish rags/napkins for my wedding) I’d love to learn to sew and make a pretty flowy shirt out of the linen napkins but I don’t know if I should. I don’t want to ruin them! Really love this! 😍 Cool ideas but sometimes it\\'s shown so fast that I can hardly follow. Anyway I\\'ll try a few of this projects. :) Thanks for the feedback 😊 Thought my phone was ringing at first, well done You are such a sweetheart 💕 \\nThe projects are wonderful. Thanks! Your fabrics are so beautiful!!! How do you pick fabrics and colors to go together??? Thank you!! Your video tutorial is quite inspiring. Unfortunately, I do not have an over locker sewing machine .  Can you suggest an alternative method for the pockets to obtain a neat finish.  Appreciate you sharing your knowledge. Blessings They also sell “overlock” presser feet that fit onto your regular sewing machine. Thanks! You can use a zig-zag stitch on your sewing machine, or cut them out with a pair of pinking shears instead 😊 Nice job, thank you. I use my really tiny non usable scraps as pillow fill... What song is at the beginning of the video?  Btw, I don’t really see but your videos are fun to watch and make me want to go sew. Lol Thank you! My husband made this song for me 😊 Keep safe! You too! X Loved this video Janelle. Stay well! @Rosery Apparel thanks lovely You too! 😘 💖 Whats the paper called for the lettering? Blizer fix? JANELLE  what is the exact name of the adhesive paper? Plisafix? I wanted to know the correct spelling too but I see she did not answer you :( I make coasters out of my scrap fabric ! 🤗 I really like your scrunchie video.  I got a book on how to do it.  But your video is a lot simpler than book! :) Thank you 🧡 ',\n",
       " 'My quantum teacher was obsessed with the Stern-Gerlach experiment. There\\'s a whole chapter on it in my grad quantum book: \"A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics\" by John S Townsend. It might be worth checking out... just beware. The book doesn\\'t use SI units (very few quantum books do), so don\\'t get hung up on units for formulas.\\n\\n\"Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particle Physics\" by Eisberg & Resnick was a good suggestion in the video description. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t do a whole lot of bra-ket notation. They mostly stick to integrals to appeal to a wider audience.\\n\\nAs for my personal thoughts on spin, I don\\'t think anyone really understands why it\\'s there. I find it interesting that particles can have inherent angular momentum, but not inherent linear momentum. It makes angular momentum seem more fundamental. This kind of makes sense if you\\'ve seen the \"A Character of Physical Law\" lectures by Feynman (from 1964). In one (or the seven lectures in the series), he explains how you can get linear momentum by measuring angular momentum from really far away. If you haven\\'t seen them, you should check them out... although, they\\'re each an hour so it\\'s huge time commitment. It\\'s one of those things where you watch one lecture a day.\\xa0 When I watched them, I took notes :-) I know this comment is 5 years old, but to the commentor or anyone else looking here, could there be a type of matter that is different to matter and antimatter in the way that instead of being complete opposites in CPT asmatter and antimatter are thought to be, it is in between, a kind of neutral matter 6:52 \"electrons are not looping around\". How does she assert that as some straightforward fact? I dont have a life, so Im probably watching all of them in a day. Thanks for the suggestion. Caltech\\'s sophomore QM class studied the Stern-Gerlach experiement (and ways of combining them) instead of the double-slit. I mean they introduced the subject with the double-slit, but the detailed study was of SG. I think that is because it shows the symmetries better than the double-slit does she asked what is it, not why it is there?,,,, u took notes...........man physics seems more difficult now than before \"Not knowing things isn\\'t dumb, but pretending you do is\"\\n\\nSo true. Thanks for a great video, I\\'ll be sure to check out these questions and write a blog post. I was going to comment the very same thing. \\u200b@Bulent Basaran If you check - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing#Etymology The evidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at Apology 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also Apology 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.\\n\\nWhat Socrates actually said was - \"... ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.\\r\"\\n... I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either. [from the Henry Cary literal translation of 1897]\\n\\nSo my point is he meant that he knows what his gaps in his knowledge are. \\n\\nNow I do fully agree with you, it is not that the person is dumb rather it is the act of pretending that is dumb. If the person stops pretending, he can stop being stupid. This way of conceptualizing people allows them to grow and improve rather than internalize these tags.\\n\\nNow I do agree that it is not stupid (dumb) to not know what we don\\'t know. All of us have gaps in what we know and it is a certainty that we don\\'t know the full list of these gaps. We can\\'t know really. \\n\\nOk now coming to pretending, sure I can usually forgive them too. Lots of times they have their own reasons - they feel insecure about themselves, they don\\'t want to hear me explain it, etc \\n\\nBut the two cases you presented do not seem to be dichotomous nor a useful way of dividing it into cases. \\n\\nOften the need to hold a strong opinion on something isn\\'t something most of us are  \"aware\" of. So I can\\'t think of many real cases of 1) while 2) is very common.\\n\\nBut I do think it is stupid to want to find a strong opinion. An opinion should only be strong if you have a correspondingly large collection of evidence supporting it. Wishing or needing for your opinion to be strong is irrational. But again I do understand that humans need certainty in their life and they prefer a wrong answer to no answer. But that just means we identify our flaws and we promote good thinking. We don\\'t say it is ok to be irrational, we hold everyone to a high standard. \\n\\nIn the case of 2) we can just promote introspection, try to see when you get emotional, often it is because your core belief was challenged. It is too common for me to call those people stupid. But I think those who don\\'t fall into 2) are talented, admirable individuals.\\n\\nOk finally when we say nothing belongs to X category you are basically saying the word is useless. We define words to have meaning. So it is a fact that people have different mental capacity. We grow at different rates for sure. I am not even sure if we all have the point where we hit diminishing returns near each other. For sure people have different talents, but it is not all fair in my opinion. Some people have a lot, some people have less. There are geniuses out there, there are people with learning disabilities. I do think there are dumb people out there. Mostly we can call actions dumb and behaviours dumb and try to disassociate it from the individual, but at some point, habits form, and values become a core part of who you are. Some people are practically beyond saving in specific areas. Like I think I am dumb in fashion, I am young and so maybe I can change but it is so unlikely and I have such bad aptitude for it that I think its an accurate way to describe me. But again this is all a Truthful look at humanity.\\n\\nIf you want to teach and help people, its fine to believe no human is dumb and everyone has infinite potential etc. Lots of myths are powerful and useful when we hold them collectively. Hey Bulent Basaran I disagree @Bulent Basaran Very well said! *『I N F I N I T E   S P I N』* The advertiser\\'s / politician\\'s dream. *Dojyannnnn....* @SoA is better than TWDSpin of Indivisible Particle : Watch...\\nhttps://youtu.be/nnkvoIHztPw @Yusa thanks. I\\'m crying again. Ravioli ravioli teach me the spinoli I asked my chem mate what is spin i think he gave me the best answer: \"imagine a ball spinning except it\\'s not a ball and it\\'s not spinning\" \"Not knowing things isn\\'t dumb, but pretending you do is.\"\\nThis was one of my single favorite lines of yours so far, and so very, very true. Well, she presented the best explanation I\\'ve ever seen yet for quantum \\'spin\\': you cannot define it except operationally: \\'spin is the property of a particle that makes it do _this_ in a Stern-Gerlach apparatus\\' .\\nThis explanation satisfies a key component of our puzzlement: \"What part of quantum \\'spin\\' justifies its retention of the idea of spinning-ness?\". Well, because of her preamble on an electron going around in a circle (revolving, which is kinda-like... rotating). When the e goes around in a circle it displays a connection with magnetism. And when a non-revolving electron goes through a magnetically salient apparatus, it _still_ betrays an affinity for magnetic behavior, albeit mysteriously aberrant.\\n\\nThis tells us further that quantum spin isn\\'t simply a (dynamic) _geometric_ phenomenon, and that naïve expectation isn\\'t normally addressed by most \\'explanations\\', those latter leave us a with a subconscious unease that something has been ignored in the profusion of verbiage on \\'spinors\\', \\'intrinsic angular momentum\\', and the like.\\n\\nMy only criticism was the intervening material on quantum notation and eigenstates, which came out of a clear blue sky and over most people\\'s heads. It might have been left for a later treatment. Klingons are stupid, but they can still use this stuff to build their disruptor pistols. What If you don’t know something but think you do so you act like you do know something.  Are you still dumb? One of my favorite lines from any video lol Not knowing things is dumb.\\nPretending to know things is stupid Great video! Sugat Kokiloo 😭true Eyyy Yesssss. Great! i loved this!!! so much. the answer is relative. I love this channel too. \"It seems that we define … things by how we measure them.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of wisdom in those words. @Irish Proc well stated It ain\\'t profound @Irish Proc If you\\'re so worried about choice of frame, why not just work over your favorite principal bundle like all the rest of the modern physicists? @Irish Proc magnetic fields DO have direction. but forget about \\'lines of force\\'. the magnetic field carries force between moving (technically, spinning or rotating) charges. steady currents can only flow in closed loops. there is also force between elements of parallel currents, but that\\'s doing it wrong. ignoring the other half of the loop leads to erroneous conclusions.\\ni like the law of Biot and Savart for describing magnetic fields. for certain cases like circular loops of current or spinning electrons, the field is simple and no calculus is required. for other shapes of loops, the field at any point is given by adding the contributions of each element of current, which are vectors. the field of an element of current, at any point, is inverse-square in strength from that element, in a direction perpendicular to both the current and the radius to that point. so the field at any point is a vector sum, which is a vector. magnetic fields really carry \\'electric angular momentum\\'. same particle that carries electric field, but spinning. the spin is magnetic field. @Irish Proc you\\'re right, but terrible example. They do have a direction, fact is we made a choice about what we should call them and how we\\'re going to put an arrow on it, but as long as you\\'re consistent, if you make it go on the oposite direction of what you called + you\\'ll probably get a different result. (exceptions on even functions? things? ya know? where f(-x) = f(x) <- still wonder the relationship between even functions and even numbers) \"what is energy? What is Charge? It seams like we define this things by how we measure them\" And this is how we detect a good scientist Is like hamon but for the rebooted jojo universe with johnny and gyro. @ゴゴ Joji Joestar ゴゴ are they not animating part 6? @Eric K wait till part 7 is animated. It is already scary how anything that has to do with spirals or spinning has jojo references. Physics baby up down left right 🤪👉🏻 There really are JoJo references everywhere isn\\'t there? Wow I came here thinking this but... to see it outside my head Arigatou... Gyro @Rodan didnt you die in the election tho? @Michal Zienkiewicz Yep. Definitely that @Michal Zienkiewicz bruh HxH community everywhere... You\\'re welcome, Johnny. I think Feynman was right. If you think you understand quantum mechanics then you don\\'t understand quantum mechanics. and there are 666 likes right there But I don\\'t no what is quantum mechanics @Kurapika Kurta First let\\'s clarify: I talked about dizer, not mass. The central point is: atoms and sub-atomic particles are not little tiny balls. They are something between particles and waves. They are better undestood as \"clouds of probability\". There ia no direct abstraction in our world about this concept. The ideia is that there is a region with a greater probability where you may measure the electron. You may measure the electron outside this region, but as far as you go, small is this probability. This probability defines where the particle is. But, if you look at the math, you may find that for some cases, there is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny probability you may measure the electron far far away where it is suposed to be. Actually, indefinitely far away. Ok, on practice the probability tends to zero quickly, so it is on almost impossible to measure the absurd things I said. But matematically it not impossible. @Jzargo Winterhold I\\'m sorry but I\\'m a complete amateur but would love to understand more of this. How can an electron be bigger than the atom? From the undergraduate science textbooks I\\'ve read so far from my understanding, the mass of an atom highly depends on the mass of the nucleus as the electron\\'s mass is completely inconsequential to the mass of the atom. So I\\'m guessing the electron may be bigger but doesn\\'t necessarily mean they have more mass? Or does that also imply that the electron can have more mass than the other particles in the atom? I think that was a Niels Bohr quote, but yeah, you\\'re right. It\\'s what you\\'re gonna need to master if we\\'re gonna win this race, Johnny K 👉🏻👌🤟🏻🤓🤪👉🏻 A very good video! While it definitely helps to imagine the Stern-Gerlach experiment being performed with free electrons, doing so would unfortunately make the experiment impossible. Magnetic fields interact with charged particles through the Lorentz force, which would cause an electron to be deflected out the sides of the apparatus. The original experiment used silver atoms, which have one outer electron in an s-shell (which has no orbit angular momentum), revealing that the lone valence electron must have had an intrinsic dipole moment. Ethan Jahns spot on!!! JOJO reference is what spin is @Kur Ajing YOU FELL FOR IT YOU FOOL,I WAITING FOR YOU TO SAY FUNNY,FUNNY VALENTINE! @AA A That\\'s funny, I don\\'t recall hating on JJBA @Kur Ajing hating jojo,is a jojo reference This is annoying everything doesn\\'t have to be a JoJo reference, the quantum spin has nothing to do with the golden ratio. JoJo reference Starts recording a video named \"What is spin\" ending up in \\n\\n\"Honestly I don\\'t know\"\\n\"The question is more important than the answer\"\\n\"Life is not as simple as you figured in your childhood\"\\n\"Not knowing is the true knowledge\" Gyro zeppeli was here The particles might just be fidgetspinning. :) Looking at it, the fidget spinner actually somewhat approximates an sp2 Orbital, doesn\\'t it? The infinitely small spin makes me think of curl. It’s literally the spin of an infinitesimal point, and is what determines magnetic fields per Maxwell’s equations. How accurate is this thought? Maybe spin is rotation on the time axis rather than a spatial one. Blimey! At last a vid on particle-spin that I could actually follow! YAAAAY!!! \"It seems that we define … things by how we measure them.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of wisdom in those words. Kyrlics exactly Lol How do we measure them if we have no definition? We already have a definition, just unconsciously. Once measured it\\'s become a conscious thing and we can consciously define it.\\n\\nOr at least, we are aware of what we will measure, than we measure it and than we define it. 7:37 \"Feeling like we understand something stops us from asking what it is.\"  Perfectly put. how does spinning work on a one dimensional axis? Beginning of the video: I\\'ll tell u what is spin.\\n\\n\\nEnd of the video: no I can\\'t do that! 1:48 - 2:48 linear algebra FTW Left is up right is down and always the opposite that’s all I can do 🤫 Lesson 3, Johnny! Repeat \"There\\'s no way that I can do this!\" five times. I thought spin was what politicians and the media do for a living 😂😂 Sorry man....but without a description of how the machine works, this doesn\\'t work AT all.\\nThe machine could very easily be inducing the electrons to spin on an oriented axis with the machine. They aren\\'t magnets...they are waves....and it\\'s really easy to induce something with so little energy/mass to move. The act of taking the measurement at this scale definitely taints it.\\nie. You throw a heavy magnet in the machine, INERTIA will resist the tendency to do this, therefore your distribution isn\\'t purely in regards to magnetic alignments, it\\'s also due to inertial mass.\\nAn electron is soooo almost massless........that the inertia doesn\\'t matter, and it will align to an external stimulus with VERY little influence. If you can do it with radio waves you can definitely do it with ANY external fields.\\nSo....that kinda sucks, because that explains the polar nature of this experiment versus the distribution...like I said...we NEED to know how the apparatus works. This makes sense, which is great. The best part for a layman like me was this: 7:35 (which was also great because it voiced how I feel about every science textbook \"this is how it is, now stop asking about it\") where you plainly say \"spin is what makes a particle like a magnet\". If someone had said that to me a long time ago, I feel like I would have understood sooner. It would have made more sense to me if they called it \"bearing\" like on a compass. Calling it a verb like \"spin\" would be like calling energy \"shock\" or \"burn\". How can metal move without moving it 🤫🤓🤟🏻🧲🔀♾ \"Bearing\" is such a better word for it. @Looking Glass Universe Thanks! I\\'m glad that resonated with you too. When I was making this video I\\'d spent weeks and weeks going \\'what is spin? But what *is* spin?\" and it was only when I realised this that I could be less frustrated about it. \\n\\nI like your analogy of calling energy \"shock\" or \"burn\", that\\'s a good way to put it! Can you make a video about the planks constant? do you spin or you have a boyfriend? :D Spin - to (cause to) turn around and around, especially fast. There, I solved physics. You\\'re welcome. I thought I was the only one who doesn\\'t understand quantum physics in class. But there are soooo many people who don\\'t understand in here. \"Lesson 1, Johnny.\" All the questions I could easily answer without google:\\n\\n2. I think a great example for this is gravity, Newton describes gravity as the gravitational constant times mass1 times mass2 over the distance between them squared. This is, of course, a mathematical equation that describes how gravity works, but not really why gravity is like that. Nobody knew what deeper mechanism was at play until Einstein came around with his theory of relativity. Now we understand that gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime. This is only one example among many of course but this is a recurring theme in science. If past results are indicate of anything, I would think that the same thing will happen for the examples you presented.\\n\\n5. I know lost of physicists describe bosons and fermions as having different measures of spin but honestly I learned them as fermions make up matter (and antimatter) while bosons mediate forces.\\n\\n11. What’s wrong with saying that an electron is infinitely small is that electrons have mass, and something with mass crunched into an infinitely small space is the definition of the singularity of a black hole. And, as we all know, the basic atomic particles are not proton, neutron, and black hole. The next part of this question, I do not know of any specific experiments though there almost certainly was one. Finally, protons CANNOT be infinitely small because they are composed of  quarks. How can something infinitely small be comprised of things that are smaller than infinitely small? Paradoxical. I see - said the the blind man. I could hurt you without a slap Yano babe ♾🔀🤟🏻 To the deaf woman k a k y o i n Stevie Wonder Said that Who picked up his hammer and saw. ;) My answer to question 2:\\n\\n*Yes* - but at some point (after enough perturbations) the concepts of \"deeper\" and \"simpler\" would have actually switched meanings.\\n\\nIn other words, if we ask questions that require measuring observations in fractions of yoctometers, the answers will start to emerge from the activity of phenomena measured in multiples of yottameters. Ah, I read a little bit about this in A Brief History of Time.  I still need to finish the book but I\\'ll come back later with knowledge \"Smaaahllah\\' foah\\'ce\" I love the physics Boston Tooaah\\'k :-) I\\'m in love with the presentation. According to me e can expressed as a complex function where variables change by many factors some from itself some from others.that gives them different magnetic properties.and all I saidjust came in my mind after watching this video When thinking about the spin of a particle i\\'m rather visualizing it as spinning \"inwards\" or \"outwards\" in the sense that it still denotes a binary state of the particle, but with more emphasis on the kinetic interaction between that particle and an external event without having to refer to an external system of direction. man i could really go for some dominos pizza after this video The mathemathics of quantum mechanics should be in high scool. Im sorry, i couldn’t help it...\\n\\n7:28 Correct punctuation/spelling is not “it’s”. It’s “its” This is great! I\\'ve been struggling to understand spin for a while now and this made it so clear! Thank you! um waow, you have the loveliest voice :> You\\'re such an amazing teacher.. I am entangled with your channel till an infinite amount of time.. :-o Wow at last someone has the courage to honestly explain that we don\\'t understand spin instead of saying we wouldn\\'t understand. Thanks.. TROUBLE with the ELECTRON  SPIN:\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqyi9oX9olA We only know it\\'s what gives particles force carrying properties and charge and basically what determines if a particle is a boson or a fermion. We also know that there are other forces beyond electromagnetism and they are also related to spins and bosons and they are pretty much analogous to electromagnetism however different bosons interact with different particles in different ways. One example is the strong nuclear force, it\\'s boson is the gluon not the photon and the gluons interact with quarks not electrons or positrons.. And it\\'s a much stronger force than electromagnetism... And also the strong force does not have polarity (positive/negative, North/South) like electromagnetism, the strong force is always attractive and glues even two protons together even though they have the same charge and are constantly repelling eachother via the electromagnetic force. So basically if the gluon and the photon had a fight the gluon would beat the hell out of the photon, the gluon is just much stronger you see... But basically the force of magnets have the Photons as it\\'s force carrier we have no idea how this force carrying process happens but we know that magnetism is based on Photons, the same thing as light. And we know that gluons are something similar to light (because they are also Massless Bosons) but with some bizarre differences. But in my opinion the most bizarre bosons are the Z and W bosons because they have a lot of mass and they are something \"ghost-like\" like how light is, how can it have mass if it\\'s not a Hadron? Could it be that it has interaction with Higgs? That would mean that the Z and W bosons are almost like the lost link between fermions and bosons, the lost link between electron and photon, because they have plenty of similarities with both and if I\\'m not mistaken the W boson quickly decays to an electron and a neutrino meaning that the electron is somehow part of it\\'s composition and the neutrino can make it into a boson somehow... It\\'s really bizarre! At the moment I don\\'t understand the weak force at all, for me it\\'s the most mysterious of the nuclear forces, it\\'s the one I understand the least. Well at least we didn\\'t name it \"dark energy\" because God knows that word of made the headlin..... wait, we did name something dark energy?... oh crap, not again. Getting the right prediction is only one of the goals. Another is trying to make sense of fundamental reality. David R well since quantum mechanics tend to be pretty difficult to impossible to imagine so math really is the only way to go.\\nGetting the right prediction is after all the goal and being able to imagine it is only a bonus. This is one of the best science videos I\\'ve ever seen. Thank you for your work. Really thoroughly enjoyed this. Going to check out your other videos now and I\\'m excited! I love cool channels that I find by accident. I can dig on this one for a WHILE.\\n\\'Gracias. So its a “thing”. K QFT makes many of those things logical and obvious. Like how the electron in really an excitation in a field. And how ist wavefunction can actually be larger than an atom. 7:55 oh few, a definition I can remember Great overview. I’m glad you emphasized that the name “spin” is simply a label borrowed from the macro world. \"demands it exists\"?  Nope. \"demands that it exist\" the amazing and wholesome subjunctive!  \\n\\nBut your physics is superb -- particularly your very intelligent insistence that you don\\'t know stuff.\\n \\n-dlj. your voice sound like my English teacher\\'s :) 2016: we will never understand quantum mechanics \\n\\n2025: someone came up with an incredible theory that made us comprehend quantum mechanics My head is spinning after listening to this video. I am now charged. Sooooo awesome to hear this video in the voice in one of my countrymen!\\n\\nGreat video, clear and concise! Can you put 3 Stern-Gerlach machines on all 3 axes (1 x, 1 y, and 1 z) with the same open space and put electrons or silver atoms or whatever in the middle? What would happen? I don\\'t understand spin but I love your voice, that\\'s something That\\'s an *Aussie* accent. I should know. I have the same accent. 😊 true, really clear and confident tone :-) i don\\'t. she has so much vocal fry I have chips on the floor now. Corrina Clark Bloody hell you\\'ve been spouting an awful lot of nonsense! But even so, you\\'ve managed to stumble upon one truth that\\'s widely misunderstood- the moon indeed pulls at the whole earth, not just the water. It causes the globe to stretch, which cause displacement of water and leads to tides. \\nStill the rest of what you\\'re writing is utter whimsical garbage. You seem proud of your inquisitive mind yet you\\'ve managed to misunderstand and muddle up such a monumental amount of information. Also, just because you can\\'t do maths does not detract it from being the universal language of reality. The fact that \"simple equations\" have predicted bizarre states of matter that can barely be understood (and therefore initially rejected by the physicist), and then these things subsequently get discovered to be real, is mind blowing. Put down the zygotes, step away from your Jupiter theory, and do some real hard studying. + Corrina Clark \"Gravity is a weak force.\" Lol. I\\'m almost tempted to take this as a well-meant pun.\\nBut your statement got me to think that ultimately, Scientific research and reflection are all about dabbling in very narrowly defined fields: sometimes looking over the neighbour scientist\\'s field, sometimes plucking flowers from it, sometimes dumping compost in it. The arbitrary boundaries are \"non-existent\" in Nature itself, our minds only create them when attempting (and often failing) to understand.\\nStill it is fascinating to see that where Astrophysics end is where Classical Mechanics begin. And where Classical Mechanics end is where Quantum Mechanics begin. Et cetera... :) first video I watched in this channel. I\\'m very impressed. great explanation. great voice too 😂 The Spin is simply the way my head feels after watching this video and feeling traumatized by a inner bombardment of questions springing from what seemed to be an answer to what Spin is so, we had a little talk me, myself and I came to the conclusion that Spin is simply confusion XD Thanks for the video !\\n\\nPS : Also, thanks for ruining many sleep hours to come because I\\'ll be trying to sooth my curiosity on the matter =] Enjoy ! For question 2: Eventually you should end up at somewhere that just is as it is (especially if we are living in a simulation), there is as far as we now a smallest amount of length (1.616*10^-35 m, also known as the Planck length. The Planck units are supposed to be the smallest of each unit respectively. Also there are more Planck units as time, energy, temperature, the Von Klitzingconstant (for resistance) and the conduction quantum (basically the opposite of the V. Klitzingconstant and is for conduction). These are the smallest amounts for the SI units which are the basic units of all of the universe and I\\'d say it isn\\'t unlogical to say that every one of them should have a smallest amount and thus I think there should be no way to explain some/all aspects of the universe after we dove into them far enough. i think i am in love with your voice..  :) thank you for messing with the SPIN.. \"feeling like we understand something stops us from asking what it really is\" sums up the way that people believe quantum mechanics are genuinely probability-based, simply because our observations haven\\'t proven otherwise. And why we jump to believing in \"dark matter\" rather than doubting our current understanding of gravity and relativity. Quarks aren\\'t particles, they\\'re a way to explain how particles behave, and the probabilities of quantum mechanics let us perform calculations. But they\\'re just analogies. They exist for the purpose of calculation, not to give an accurate picture of reality, but so many scientists fall into the trap of assuming the first proposed model of something (so long as it works in the equations) and explaining it to students without an asterisk. This method of teaching cannot do anything for science except hinder progress toward the truth, and it encourages complacency. Why shouldn\\'t we doubt the idea that the universe is inherently probabilistic? The only answer is that many scientists and teachers have little genuine interest in science at its heart, so they like believing we understand more than we really do. Unfortunately, it is the business of teachers to create something called \\'understanding\\' in the minds of their students, which leads them to think there really is an understanding there. In fact, they merely transmit methods and ways of describing things. Of the things themselves we know nothing - not even if \\'thing\\' is really a thing (as it were). Just one word: gravity. this was an excellent video. i believe that when trying to illustrate a new concept, you should show the problem that brought about its creation. you did exactly that. I just discovered your channel. I\\'m gladly subscibing! keep doing great stuff I\\'m lucky I watched this video! if not i would have misled by any \"I know all sources\". Thanks! Its wonderful explaination,specially the line every body else forgot to says if we conder electron spinning ,the radius is calculable and  result is totally  wrong This is the first physics video, that is honest, that I\\'ve seen on YT.  Thank you for your honesty. When I was a student so fond of science, and still I am, I was so hungry for knowledge, found old style quantum mechanics books so dry and in a hurry to bang equation in your face without really explaining the background and the work that was done to reach to the equation. Some authors so in a hurry to publish Atoms of silver were used in Stern–Gerlach experiment due to their neutral charge. Electrons, or any charged particles, that move in magnetic field feel the Lorentz force. The non-linear path of silver atoms was another hint that spin is not assosiated with classical spinning/moving charge. Atoms of Silver, the NBA commissioner? So in short...\\n\\nWe still don\\'t really know what spin is. For sure, but if you look back at the history of science, there have been many many times that we thought we had found the most basic fundamental indivisible form matter/energy, and sometimes with good reason. So what are the chances that now, when you and I just so happen to be alive, we actually have this time? I\\'m not saying it\\'s impossible, but let\\'s just say the chances are \"quantum\". =) Well, those theories are all conjecture at this point so it doesn\\'t necessarily mean that electrons can be broken down. Whether they actually can be remains to be seen. Dan Nguyen Well some say that there are quarks inside electrons, (others say there is something else, like preons). So that means u can break electrons down. Yeah, it\\'s just a completely separate but changeable property of an electron that gives an electron a magnetic polarity independent of orientation...though we don\\'t physically know WHAT it is.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t be surprised if at some point as things get smaller, things just are what they are because you can\\'t break them down any farther to see how they work. The electron is an elementary particle, after all. We\\'re just so used to working on the macro level where we can actually break things down to see what\\'s inside. At the very least, it\\'s probably a mistake to automatically assume that spin must have a mechanical analog on the macro scale. PTNLemay \\nI understood it like the \"polarity\" of a particle, like... its spacial distribution, if it is up, or down I loved your depiction of this eerie phenomenon. I just got the hunch it (the spin \\'behaviour\\') might be the key to <how> we do not understand magnetism (rather than to how we could imagine an electron). Hope this triggers some. Intro (Quantum Mechanics/Spin) : \"I\\'ll explain why don\\'t we understand it\"😅 Thank you very much :o I\\'m writing a thesis on magnetic phenomens like superparamagnetism and I have to explain spin to college student :S. You really helped me with that video I was gonna write those blabla things in my thesis. I\\'ve just discovered this channel and it looks great :) Keep it up ! Hope u\\'ll read this message Wow, thank you so much to everyone who\\'s participated! It\\'s been really fun to read and think about your comments. It was my birthday yesterday so I was doing things yesterday and will be doing things all of today. But after that, I\\'ll finally get around to answering everyone. Could you tell the source of the size of the electron you presented in 7:17? I\\'ve found some links that say an electron could be bigger than a proton, but regarding an atom, I\\'d like to know what atom and how large exactly. @Howard Malpas Particles don\\'t have spin... it is, Spin that has particles. An electron is not a solid, therefore the term spin is meaningless , the term spin as you call depends on the charge in the cloud or electon which is a wave function, therefore by measuring it changes its property or spin as you call it. Looking Glass Universe Email DraftScience - ds@draftphysics.com for a debate? He has over 6 years of science videos... Here\\'s his response to this video... https://youtu.be/9sHErolLX_s explaining Spin. Happy 2 year ago Birthday 😀. THERE ISN\\'T EVEN ONE \"A\", N O R AN \"R\", IN THE WORD \"NO\". \\n\\nSay it! No. No. Try it. NOOAAR. This is very helpful, thank you! +Lane Votapka You invited me to ask questions. I apologize if someone\\'s already asked this, but I heard that fermion wavefunctions will be antisymmetric if they are exchanged, and bosons will be symmetric if exchanged, and whether the particles are fermions and bosons depend on the spin. Is this related to the negative in the \"it turns out\" section of this video? Why does an antisymmetric wavefunction imply that two particles cannot occupy the same energy state? Somehow I know less about what spin is than when I started despite learning a lot. Oh my god finally EUREKA! Great video. Thank you so much for clarifying what spin actually means! Now I can sleep in peace. great video. fantastic channel. I have been looking for channels like this one and found yours through physics girl. I like the homework assignment too Okay, so here\\'s my best way of getting my head around this concept: particles have angular momentum, meaning they\\'re oriented in a certain direction (call it left/right.) So if a particle did spin, it would spin in that direction. I love your presentation. It is so clear and wonderful to find someone asking for suggestions. I have thought a great deal about fundamental physics and have come to the conclusion that light is a wave disturbance of spacetime (similar to a gravitational wave) and that electrons (and protons and neutrons) are looped wave disturbances of spacetime.\\n\\nThinking of the electron as a looped wave disturbance of spacetime it is the wave variation in the time dimension which leads to electric charge. So the charge is distributed around the loop and the wave is travelling at the speed of light within the loop. This then gives the electron its magnetic properties since there is a circular movement of charge.\\n\\nhttps://www.academia.edu/5927513/The_Spacetime_Wave_Theory \\n\\nhttps://www.academia.edu/5038836/The_Unification_of_Physics\\n\\nRichard charge and energy were also my questions, i am so glade to  know some one in the physics world shares the same, looks like spin is going to be added to the list now. Thank you so much, nice videos keep up the good work What is Spin ?  I think the answer is phase shift (= shift in coordinate).\\n1.  I think the de Broglie waves of multiple particles in one quantum state are connected in series, and the each wave shift msλ at the connecting point.  (ms:spin quantum number, λ:wave length)Let us consider a case in which two electrons are in one quantum state [n,l,ml,ms=+1/2].\\nThe de Broglie wave of 1st electron shifts +λ/2 in coordinate. And the de Broglie wave of 2nd electron shifts +λ/2+λ/2 in coordinate.  Accordingly the two waves destructively interfere. \\n [the Pauli exclusion principle]\\n2.  Suppose that two electrons are moving in a single orbit, and suppose that the de Broglie wave of one electron shifts +λ/2 in coordinate and the de Broglie wave of another electron shifts -λ/2 in coordinate.\\nThe two waves have the shift of exactly one wavelength, which leads to a constructive interference of the wave, making it possible for the two particles to move in the same orbit. \\n[the 4th quantum number]\\n3. The variable of wave function Φ{φ･(r ×p)} in φ direction has angular momentum r ×p.   \\nAccordingly, the shift in coordinate msλ change the angular momentum as follows: ml(h/2π)→ ml(h/2π)+ms(h/2π).                                   \\n\\n I\\'m sorry that I\\'m not good at English. So why do moons/stars spin backwards creating an angular problem? So spin is creating a magnetic field, that\\'s something. Thank you. This is very useful. I love how you leave an open question at the end. It makes me want to discover more. 7:38 Haha this talks to me so much :D\\nYour explanations were outstanding in this video but the visual comic spin you gave it was better than ever also. I’m going to have to try again later. I find quantum stuff works best in small doses You\\'re Aussie. So am I! We\\'re the bestttttt! I really liked the video.\\nPlus, I think your attitude while explaining is just the best.\\nYou earned a subscriber. As a pretty enthusiastic lay person, I\\'ve been waiting for this video for years. Thanks for clearing up that this isn\\'t at all cleared up :) EXCELLENT EXPLANATION. I want to know what do paired electron spin and an unpaired electron spin mean ? The honesty here is amazing. But the video is so sad. I wish I could say something productive about spin, but I don\\'t understand it either. I didn\\'t realize that professional physicists don\\'t know why spin happens, even though it is the most commonly used example in QM of a binary measurement. I hope this video inspires a better understanding of spin somewhere and that I can find out about that understanding. OMG!!! those questions in the description made my head spin a lot faster than any spinning subatomic partical that iam aware of😵😵😵 i\\'m just learning ap chem here.... this is a bit beyond me T.T especially when the word eigen got added. Why does the enclave insist on the existence of particles? Center of mass? Imo, \"particles\" only exist as the result of collisions and as center of mass of the distribution of energy in the wave function. It appears matter is harmonic and akin to analyzing standing waves, resonance and dissonance all the same, not exrcuciatingly small pinpoint particles. When measuring force of particles here on earth, doesnt earth\\'s gravity effect the behavior of these particles? ',\n",

       " 'Ce défilé! Je regarde pour la douzième fois! Loic Prigent Moi Pour La Première Fois. Les filles marchent Trop Vite j\\'ai arrêté à la 06ieme Minutes. I was more impressed with the choir than some of the fashion by LV. It\\'s takes skill to appreciate true art I\\'VE SUNG FOR THAT SHOW! SO GRATEFUL TO NICOLAS GHESQUIÈRE, WOODKID, BRYCE DESSNER, MILENA CANONERO, CATHERINE SIMONPIETRI AND ALL FRIENDS FOR THE RIDE! Wow! That whole show must have required so much rehearsal! Music please thank u for the great show Looks like those background people are from gucci collection and they are next to show after this louis vuitton😁 Spot on 😄 Yes, and I was sooo looking forward to see their much more fun interesting outfits! They are mannequins Exactly Looooooooooool OMG absolutely beautiful show @Théo Goldberg beautiful Thank you Alejandro I sung for it at the Louvre museum, unforgettable! I loved the dressed up choir, the singing and the music. \\n\\nWho they are and what was that piece of music? @Dashawn Plays! Then you can delete it. Anna Juli ayo i never wrote this😭 this new to me too @Dashawn Plays! I don\\'t understand why you\\'ve written this.

Ru UK klm. ,&@Théo Goldberg cup drop GDP.. @Théo Goldbergh cry set      to @Théo Goldberg cb bio HTTPcup Fri cry cry-- For some reason I imagined Mr Bean falling on the spotlight in the middle of the show The perfect closing to Paris Fashion Week and to Fashion Month. I missed THIS Nicolas Ghesquière who made me start to love fashion! My good old Ghesquière! Amazing collection! @ Anna Juli : The main choir is Sequenza 9.3 directed by Catherine Simonpietri, plus many choristers from other choirs and a few pro singers, plus many extras who weren\\'t singing. The music is \"Long lights\" by  Woodkid and Bryce Dessner, and it was composed for the event. Real opera , stylish outfits, and organized event ... REAL ART The model in 8:31 is in the movie, Love by Gaspar Noe. I had no idea this actress also modeled Feels like I watched an opera. Sometimes it\\'s like the people in the back are the audiences and sometimes it\\'s like they\\'re performers. This is new and I like it. I feel like I\\'m watching Les Miserables! 3:31 my favorite 🔥🔥💯 The orchestras was phenomenal the ambulance Wow !!! Have to give it to the people who organized all of that... But the fashion I\\'m so sorry quiche this is something that has been done over and over... Where is the creativity and yet you charge your children\\'s hides if not their souls for this. And they knows what I mean by this....  \\nEither way it\\'s still very well done production. People who blurt out \"best show!\" Chances are they say that for every show. I wish I could collect all his collection since Callaghan to LV. ❤️ him & his works. The mountain jackets are insaaaane 😍 exactly how I would design them myself, looove Not exactly new. Definitely seen that look before. One word: \"Exquisite\" In My Opinion The Choir Sounded So Good And The Collection Was Amazing As Well As The Models As Always I Am Still A Fan Of LV Work Of Art In Fashion Forever I Will Leave At That PEACE. Only innovations are masterpieces. Ridiculous statement Why is there no expression on their faces This collection was absolutely exquisite!! Nicholas is a genius!! ❤👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Woodkid just makes my heart flutter. He is a genius when it comes to music and vision. Love him Creative and well done 👏👏👏 looks like background are hosts from the past idea 😂 4:24 shes beautiful! Louis Vuitton EVERYTHING is my favorite! Such uncomfortable silhouettes! Love the jackets though such a creative idea of all the choir dressing as different era. iconic and impressive 2:00 who is she? 🤩\\nEdit: Figured it out! Her name is Mika Schneider🌟 All the models look angry. I can\\'t tell you how many times this man has made my heart skip a fashion bear. ❤ I like the mannequins singing in the background. Total Sims 3 music being played and sang lol. Beautiful show though best show! what a masterpiece!  absolutely amazing collection and presentation, everything! !  LOVE IT! Hyped though Beautiful! God bless you all. Um dos Desfiles mais incríveis da temporada.\\nEssas peças são desejos instantâneos.\\nParabéns, belíssimo show. Amazing Nicolas 👌🏻🖤\\n\\nCONGRATULATIONS LV 👏🏻 The best. Love color blocks....\\nGenius!!! Me: wears plastic bag Wow Kris DeGirolamo at 6:23 such otherworldly androgynous beauty beyond comparison... Seems like the collection was inspired by The Wizard if Oz and Alice in Wonderland ... but in a good way \\'Back To The Future\\' YES YES YES!!!!! innovative, modern, fun, clever, with interesting details, diverse, wearable. I cant thank u enough for the beautiful art!!! ♡♡♡♡♡♡ Nicolas you rock!!!the collection is awesome!!! Watching the future fashioned Amazing 🌞🙏🏻✨ out of space كد Bess show!! 💯 Love it always good prices too! Good  work by Cyberdyne Systems.  They\\'ve come a long way since Model 101. ❤️ Love LV. this is amazin\\' 👏🏼❤👀 6:20 favorite by far Everything i love! Sooo beautifulllllllll!!!! Iconic , master piece !. A modern xv century . Bravo Nicolas !!! Marie Antonette was shook! 👀 I\\'m I the first to notice that the idea to have a chorus in the background dressed in historical costumes is not original?\\n None of the reviews seem to notice so I\\'m just going to assume this is really a fluke and copying something already done at the Metropolitan Opera over 10 years ago was an accident.\\nI literally just noticed a few hours ago when the Met made available the performance for free but the 2007 Mark Morris production of Orfeo ed Euridice (with costumes by Isacc Mizrahi) uses the chorus of that opera in quite a similar way to the one shown in this fashion show.\\n\\nIf this, however, wasn\\'t a fluke I find the fact that a show using music from a forgotten composer that lived centuries ago decided it was OK to ignore a more recent famous production as laughable as the silhouettes on parade in this show! Is this years theme ugly and unwearable clothes for fashion? I loved the music but it makes it quite stressful. The clothes and music do not match. The music is beautiful! Beautiful music 🙏🏻 Wwwwoooowwww 😶 beautiful! I saw a video earlier with cody fern who went there 😁 is it only me or no one notice the background peoples looks like 15 century or some thing It\\'s a mix of historical styles from the past 5 centuries designed by Milena Canonero In the first time I noticed the background seems like puppet. No i think it’s just you BRAVO !! Beautiful! Absolutely breathtaking. A brilliant collection and presentation. Thank you. Tremendous show and the mise en scene ..... sublime Bravo Magnificently crafted! God bless you my frs. I\\'m  livin for  the  18th & 19th century infused influences in  the  background in  this  collection.I\\'m  seeing  from  a few  of  the  fashion  houses 18th & 19th century influences\\nMoschino & Gucci Etc\\nThat  was  always  one  of  my  favorite  eras✨💖\\nHowever with  Louis Vuitton  I\\'m  really  just  A fan  of  the  bags  & accessories.\\nSpring  summer  collection  were  A definite hit for  A lot  of  the  label houses However.Fall winter 2020 not  really  impressed although  Versace & Givenchy & Balenciaga  have taking  lead role for  fall winter 2020 influence  in my opinion Is it just me or does that new design look like mf doom What’s the music starts at 6:35? i think some of the jackets look rlly cheap WOW hoping to find out what the last song is called or what the entire opera piece is called. Figured out that at the end they are repeating 1699 and 1711 since they are \"Nicolas de Grigny\\'s only surviving music is a large volume of organ works,\\xa0Premier livre d\\'orgue\\xa0(Paris, 1699; second edition 1711).\\xa0\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_de_Grigny\" @Francisco Negrin thanks! Love woodkid! specially composed music by woodkid and bryce dressner based on french 17th century composer de grigny To me sounds like phillipe glass.... Beautiful! Loved it primeiro que a coleção é maravilhosa! e depois a ideia desse coral é GENIAL! como sempre fechando com chave de ouro a temporada. 只有我觉得后面一群人的着装更好看？ เอวัง โห ตุ เต ชยมังคลัง ทีฆายุโก โห ตุ มหาราชา ชินปัญจระมัชฌัมหิ วิหะรันตังมฮีตะเล สะทาปาเรนตุมังสัพเพ สัตตา\\nโรคา ฝรั่งวินาสสันตุ บุพกรรม ทุกขัง บุพกรรม อนิจจัง อนาคตอนัตตา กำหนดรูปนามให้เป็นอนัตตี แล้วพี่จะมีความสุข สาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาธุ I wasn\\'t impressed. i didnt see the cohesion in the collection. Because there was none. Thinking maybe the leather? Amazing dresses😍 Jeff Koon\\'s stage, and losing the last hue in early Balenciaga, the globalizational Philip Roth\\'s tale in reality. 유령 분위기 Thank you so much🙏🏻 Genius genius GENIUS! why they walking like that tho French man i need house  why you made me loos my money with hamada and who made djni inside me i need  house . Talentless....when you compare this to Gucci or Dolce e Gabana, it\\'s pathetic! There\\'s unflattering, ugly clothes - cool- and just unflattering and ugly. I am not even women and I could wear many of these pieces I hear indonesian traditional music vibe at 6:40 until 8:00 what happened Those clothes are so Beautiful 音樂太吵 Just beautiful show.. always I LOOOVEEE!!!

       " 'Which video game company are you on bad terms with? @Melvin they did start the whole dlc thing.... @Quartzer cuphead sucks Activision @Mohammed Ahmed Bayonetta is much more fun @Mohammed Ahmed no it isn\\'t Can\\'t spell HATE without EA. @Rat Trap I played PES06. Is it bad? @Hunter Crindson Lmao! Yes you can change HATE to EA and forget H AND T. Can\\'t spell DEATH without EA Dhiardana Rachmadiargo are you dumb 10. EA\\n9. EA\\n8. EA\\n7. EA\\n6. EA\\n5.

EA Best company if all times who suck a** : EA Multimedia Man Activision Honorable mention: EA sports Dishonorable mention: EA *\"it\\'s in the game\"* \"EA Games, challenge everything.\"\\n\\nWhen really they will challenge your faith in humanity when you play their games. charge everything Except our ability to make NFL games.  We pay millions to make sure no on else can. Midnight Club Still Cancelled Soz More like your own money just to spend some useless DLC packs like in the Sims 4 @Emperor Arceus pokemon hold my beer Game freak hold my beer EA: _Single player games are dead_\\n\\nWho else hate this statement This makes Kratos cringe so hard EA: We\\'re Untouchable Douche-Bags!\\nMe: Allow Me To Introduce Myself, Yeet! Yeah after SimCity requires internet connection for no reason @Rayyan Karim Agree. These are all great examples of great games. @Lucca the Super Mario Gamer and sony The CEOs of Activision and EA sound like they were influenced by the mafia. @tiru liru i was taking about Disney\\'s  games not disney. @HERETIC GAMER447 What about Bethesda? @Naveen Dahiya Not really, Disney has been really terrible. They ruined Simpsons and LucasArts and made a shitty 3D Club Penguin game that\\'s worse than the original Club Penguin (great game BTW). Not to mention, they made god-awful live action movies. And even Bethesda and Konami. shareholders,same thing EA is so hated, it\\'s overqualified for this list. Seriously, why do people still give EA money? @Rapidshot I find alot(not all, but alot)\\nof those sports gamers only play those games. They only buy those games, not of any support/loyalty to EA per se, but to only support NFL, FIFA, MLB, NBA etc. \\nYou have to understand that these kind of people live, eat, breath, sleep, study sport competition like religion. This is why they have no qualms paying $60/70+ for basically is just a roster update. the world is full of crazy people @Dylan Collins jedi fallen order is the worst Star Wars game ever made lol Well, some of the best games are from a branch conpanies of EA like Viceral (Dead Space) and Bioware (Mass Effect). So we give EA a money in non direct way. @Writer B ya but if they hadn\\'t pissed off Disney we probably wouldn\\'t have gotten star wars jedi fallen order They hate yet they can\\'t stop buying their games yes because of anti capitalism. Copyright and patent is an anti competitive measure, meaning it creates monopoly, in the case of Madden they are the only people who can make an NFL game (no competition). Anti capitalism creates wealth inequality and poor product for high price @Potato Chips and 2k players Yep they are just keyboard warriors Bulldozer Studios Damn interesting story there I like to consider myself an exception. While I hate Bethesda with a burning passion, when someone offered me a copy of a pirated version of Fallout New Vegas, complete with all the DLCs, in exchance for my copy of The Sims 1 that I didn\\'t play anymore, how could I say no? After playing Fallout 1, I really wanted to dive into the 3D Fallout games, but Bethesda\\'s stupidity was holding me back from buying any of the games.\\nI hate to say it, but I\\'m one of those fans who can\\'t forgive Bethesda for all the stupid stunts they\\'ve pulled with Fallout 76, and it has me extremely hesitant to buy any of their games. I *REALLY* want to play Fallout 4, especially after playing the hell out of New Vegas, but until Bethesda gets their act together and stops being an embarrassment to the industry, I\\'m refusing to pay a cent for ANY of their games. Hell, I\\'ve told myself numerous times that if they pull ANOTHER stunt like 76 with Fallout 5, I\\'m just going to delete this copy of New Vegas I\\'m sitting on and give up on Bethesda and their games altogether. And although it\\'s a pirated copy, I got this thing for trading off The Sims 1, so I pretty much got it for free, and I\\'ve been enjoying the heck out of it. I can see why people call it the best game in the series. I really want to support these games, but thanks to Bethesda\\'s own stupidity, it\\'s just not gonna happen. :(\\nAnd as I\\'m sitting here writing this, I have in my lap an authentic, PHYSICAL copy of Fallout 1, the game that started it all, which I also played the hell out of. It really makes me sad to look at this old relic, remember how fantastic of a game it was, and then look at Fallout 76 and see the series spiraling into a fiery wreck like it has been. And yes, I know Fallout 1 was before Bethesda\\'s time, so I can\\'t get over the fact that these games were just better in general before Bethesda took it over. 2:11 that caught me off guard lmao Activision: ruined Spiderman\\n\\nInsomniac: saved Spider-Man Spider-man web of shadows is 2nd place @Saad Hasan no wonder Microsoft is in this list @O.G. Francis well PS4 users don\\'t have an open world racing game like Forza Horizon the closest they got was Driveclub to me it was a successor of Project Gotham Racing series on Xbox & Xbox 360 another one of my favourites but then Sony fucked up the studio and the game itself @one man army Batman Arkham series are way better @one man army and what are your Xbox exclusives, Halo? U just mad at the fact that the best games isn\\'t available on the Xbox One Don\\'t understand how EA has yet to be listed as a worldwide criminal organization @AJA Ryan1994 gambling for people under 18 is illegal in many countries Irving Marino 🤣 Because they’re not doing anything illegal? Ea = Team Rocket. Just need that ten year old kid to destroy them @Derrick Haggard As evil as they are, they still can\\'t hold a candle to EA in simple terms of numbers of lives ruined. Yep, EA was definitely going to be on here. XD One they sold plants Vs zombies for 2000 inr  , WTF They deserve to be on the list Tbh I thought sega would be up here Idk why they published a FPS game of PvZ EA\\nKonami\\nBethesda\\nActivision\\nBlizzard Part II:\\n\\nUbisoft is the artist of lie that separates realistic trailer into illusionary actual game.\\nEpic Games is awkward,by the way.\\nNaughty Dog is the PornHub of video games.\\nLJN is the death wizard of failure.\\nAcclaim was broke.\\n343 Industries is the Halo\\'s slaughterhouse.\\nBungie is the new Blizzard but tossed Activision.\\n\\nSega(Sonic The Hedgehog 2006),Nintendo,TecmoKoei(Dead or Alive DLC$),\\nSquareEnix,and Bandai-Namco are kinda neutral. And LJN riot games The Fatal Five Me: Where\\'s Ubisoft? You know Ubisoft has done something right seeing as how they weren’t on this list. O.G. Francis ,same. @Jared Reeves yeah they really fucked up Rare and the Xbox One launch and RROD I currently have an Xbox One X and I am havung a great time with it and Gamepass feels good I\\'m hoping that Ubisoft will save PvZ while I like BFN and PvZ 3, other people don\\'t like the graphics Watch Dogs 2 is still my favourite Ubisoft title to this day Ubisoft also fired patrice desilets the creator of sands of time and the assassins creed series. I’m gonna be completely honest, at the moment, I feel more anger towards Bethesda instead of EA @Shail Darji I have to disagree. Just look at Creation Club. It\\'s horrendous. But regardless, both EA and Bethesda suck. @tiru liru dude even if Bethesda is awful it is a good company when u compare it to cancerous EA @Italics Not to mention, every games they have made were streamlined and dumbed down. @ΛutistiЄ Agreed. @Youlo King They are also anti-consumer. Konami: Prevents Kojima from claiming his game award.\\n\\nAlso Konami: \"Why don\\'t you like us anymore?\" They say sociopaths genuinely cannot comprehend why their actions are wrong. Ikr... Take-Two Interactive \\nFor putting gambling in a E rated and Pegi 3 game @Piulin I would keep grinding if I could make easy money. On games like Azur Lane, you can grind without playing. My life isn\\'t anything special. @TwistedGaming918 just say it: PAY OR KEEP GRINDING AND NEGLECTING YOUR REAL LIFE What about trying to sue a modder for trying to make a pc port of RDR1 @Ballin Balgruuf People seem to forget spending is OPTIONAL. All they have to do is put more effort. @Mr. Manager not really The only respect I give Epic Games is for creating the Unreal Engine They also helped kill lootboxes with the free to play battle pass monetization system That moment when you realize Blizzard is Activision Blizzard, so double Activision in the list Well until recently, although Activision owned Blizzard, they were pretty much independant. However, since one of the Blizzard founders left the company - Mike Morheim - Activision seems to have extended their direct control of BE, spreading their unwanted and hated practices to infect that company as well. I could be wrong, but in my humble opinion, MM left Blizzard because he knew what was coming and wanted no part of it. Typical gamer logic: \"I hate Madden! It hasn\\'t changed in years!\" Gives it a 1-star rating.\\n\\nStill buys the next Madden. Never bought one. Never will. Same goes for Call of Duty. Brent Granger I haven’t bought a new Madden. Every copy I’ve gotten was used. The only copy I enjoy playing is Madden 07 on the GameCube. I can play that for hours, honestly Just pirate the f*cking thing then The title should’ve been ‘WHY PEOPLE HATE EA’ Watchmojo has a list for that.  It\\'s called Top 10 Worst Things EA has ever done.  Yes, the company got its own list.  Although not in a good. way. DH I have idea Top ten reasons why everyone hate EA Yup Another way Activision\\'s hated is that they fired the original team at Infinity Ward. Giraffelord0 I\\'m not gay. I’m just thankful for the likes. Giraffelord0 how \\'bout you watch what you say. thank for likes if gay Crash: Mind over Mutant was a franchise killer, but they revived it with N.Sane trilogy. @Shumunya Cho nice I don\\'t know how these companies are so hated by the customer and yet they turn up billions In revenue every year If someother company does good football game i would never ever play EA. Death Awaits \\n\\nAt least he didn’t waste his money on a trashy PS4 and played their boring walk simulators Please do not underestimate human stupidity! Ever since they destroyed the Mass Effect franchise I have stopped any and all purchases of games or products from companies under or related in any way to EA. \\nI was even asked why I cancelled a specific order. I told them why (EA) and the reply was:\"that is stupid. that is never going to hurt us. We have more than enough customers.\" So yeah! Never ever will I buy EA products or from companies related to them. I have a friend who bought an Xbox right after telling me how much he hates Xbox and now he barely plays it because other then gears and halo he plays nothing else on it I mean why do people waste there money even when they know what there in for you might as well dress up a turd and pay $400 for it like why 😂 17RedKnight how do u know those r the ppl? sum r casuals who dont care \"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?\"\\n\\n- Angry Video Game Nerd Gamefreak is laughing in darkness And\\nYOU DONE #$([€} IT UP!!!\\n\\n-Angry Joe The Sims community is also always upset with EA, but I guess our voices are never as strong. As someone who played it since the first instalment, EA got really lazy with the game and never listen to consumers input. It\\'s frustrating. You know how much a complete version of the sims 4 costs? Over 850 dollars. It’s half of a full damn paycheck to buy the whole thing. It’s 2 car payments. @Manuel Calavera Just like every other gamer out there. For if SIMs is a waste of time, so is pretending to kill people with digital weapons, racing cars you\\'ll never be able to afford, controlling a team you\\'ll never be talented enough to play on or coach, or concurring the world with armies that never that you would never possibly command in your lifetime. You can\\'t convince me that one way to blow off steam in a pretend digital world is any better or worse than another. Each and everyone is just a method of escapist entertainment. So I say more power to them all. @Faepan \\nOk. 👍 Manuel Calavera as do you apparently :) @Faepan \\n20 million?! Damn! These People REALLY need to get a life! Now you should do “Activision V EA: Which Company Is Worse?” Bethesda EA games:\\nBad in general: 4\\nPotentially good games: 5\\nRushed games: Infinity\\n\\nActivision:\\nDisappointing games: 2\\nPotentially good games: 4\\nRushed games: 5 something The New 117 🤣 what about Bethesda and Ubisoft 🤣 They\\'re both equally horrible in their own scummy ways. Only difference is EA\\'s been the Devil for YEARS; well before MTXs & live services people knew EA to be a garbage company that killed studios & treated devs like crap. But those stupid sports games keep EA effing RICH. U_U Gamefreak Blizzard started it\\'s downfall once Activision bought it and took over. @Phobos of Fear They became big a.k.a. evil.\\nI hope it won\\'t happen with CD Project Red as well. @abrahamWCE Nah, Activision & Vivendi Games (division of Vivendi, parent of Blizzard) merged into ActivisionBlizzard (with Vivendi holding a controlling share). Later Activision bought themselves out and are therefore independent from Vivendi. @Phobos of Fear I miss the days in the early 2000\\'s when COD was still good That would make sense since Prototype was an acutally decent game by Activision, so maybe Activion wasn\\'t always so bad Vivendi bought both Activision & Blizzard and spun off them later Everytime I hear \"Surprise Mechanics\", my brain physically hurts. Seriously it hurts more when you look she seriously doesn’t want to say “surprise mechanics” but she has to. Your brain\\'s giving you a surprise vibe check. Says a lot about Capcom how they would’ve easily been on a list like this a decade ago Same with ubisoft.\\nBut they both are improving. Atleast there learning from their mistakes Epic games\\nExample: fortnite acts like crap, has multiple problems,glitches,and literally has no support line tim sweeney pls fix your damn game! Dont forget UT4. They abadoned that good game @Quevo yes Epic Games is actually a good gaming company. They\\'re literally only on this list because of the fornite community. They actually listen to fans, created an unreal engine, and they give away free games every week, GTA 5 being the most prominent. @some body oh yes. If a game is not free, then it should not have them Yes and the graphics are just bad man you can\\'t run it on low end of anymore EA - Extremity Addicts\\nEA - Extremely Angry\\nEA - Expense Addicts I will never forgive EA for what they\\'ve done to Dead Space series and Visceral Games studio, not even if one day they decide to remaster all three games, greedy evil bastards..... Pvz was my first and favourite childhood game... now wtf has happened to the pvz franchise after ea bought popcap They stuffed everything Don\\'t forget C&C. Godamn mobile gamers. I feel you because am a battlefield fan and i hate how their letting there game die battlefield 1 was amazing but bf5 is shit Yeah I think WB Interactive Entertainment is alright. At least Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment included Albert Francis Simmons/Spawn in Mortal Kombat 11 as a fan service. As long as they and NetherRealm Studios don\\'t implement microtransactions and loot boxes in Injustice 3, since it\\'s bound to happen, then everything gameplay-wise will be Gucci. @Lautaro Ozan Mk 11,Shadow of war. Great games that are overshadowed by greed. @Lautaro Ozan I wholeheartedly agree! WB does really good games, just need to chill with the greedy things That “surprise mechanics” still burns me up!  Jim Sterling had every right to slam EA for making that disgustingly greedy remark! Ikr Activision is the worse when it comes to supply drops Micro transactions in EA games are fucked much worse than Activision @Your mom yes, those were good games EA is only bad for their money issues and their bad team balancing system on their games. I have to say the only good part about EA is the plants vs zombies franchise @M S ok @Pixel Fan22 I never liked Apex, tbh. Ever. Prediction before watching: EA is number 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: yep Totally called it I hate these companies!\\nMe: Still playing their games. @Dan Kuso  that\\'s because most of the games after NFS underground two was made  was trash.\\nDon\\'t you see w hat they did to NFS World? @SAGE MANE So you skipped NFS Underground 2, Most Wanted, Carbon, Hot Pursuit Remastered? @Dan Kuso  Not since Need For Speed: Underground lol @SAGE MANE Still playing EA Games? So true 😂 Epic games has one good thing:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnreal Engine\\n\\nWhich is also uses for pubg (maybe mobile because I don\\'t play pubg much) EA “SPORTS!” ITS IN THE GAME!\\n            👆replace that with 👉Dorks.  Bye bye Now, can we get a Top 10 Video Game Companies Fans Love the Most?\\n\\nEdit: I just want to say, thank you to everyone who has replied to me. I honestly didn\\'t think there were still THIS MANY loved video game companies who truly do care about making good games. I didn\\'t think there was any hope left in the AAA gaming industry anymore & I was depressed. I only thought CDProjectRED was the last & only good one left. When I wrote this comment it was originally intended sarcasm because, knowing the constant bad reputation & bad news I constantly hear all the time from so many bad companies (look no further than news reported about it from Angry Joe & The Jimquisition) I thought, \"Is it even possible anymore to create such a Top 10 list like that.\" Well now, I\\'m glad that you guys proved to me, \"Yes. Yes it is.\" @Zeephare id Software. They rock af If Naughty Dog is hated for TLO2,and CD Project is hated for crushing they employees,and Nintendo is hated for Pokemon Sword and Shield,and Rockstar is hated for GTA online so every single game company is hated they are no loved video game companies Didn\\'t CD Projekt Red become more hated in recent years for crunching the hell out of its employees?\\n\\nEDIT: Maybe I wanted this to be sarcastic, I honestly don\\'t know. Some people say that\\'s lies, some people say that\\'s true, but everyone shames and slams me for not knowing it, so I hope you can undestand if facts are a bit murky to me I mean part of the reason I think Skyrim is bad is because I just ran into so many bugs, l also played the other Elder Scrolls game first which just did the same thing but better. @M S I think of those games as duds and not enough to bring them down. Animal crossing was great and games like Doom: Eternal are coming to Switch soon. When It comes to Mario kart tour, as long as games like that stay on mobile where they belong and don\\'t come to Switch, I really don\\'t care. Anyone remember Midway? That was my favorite video game company. All of the classic Mortal Kombat games. Good times. RIP Midway. Double M 11/08 I remember them I have a feeling that Naughty Dog is going to enter this list very soon. franchis”E”     kill”A”s where\\'s Take-Two Interactive? Naughtydog is eagerly waiting to join this club. Our last hope now remain on CDPR. What about riot games Someone tell watchmojo that destiny wasnt made by activision Destiny is a halo rip off True, Bungie does Destiny but Activision was involved with earlier versions of Destiny with Bungie until Bungie said enough and severed ties with Activision. Personally, I think Microsoft learned their lesson. It seems like the Xbox Series X is meant to make up for the One\\'s flop. Xbox one is still better than PS4 because of game pass and backwards compatibility, elite controller , Xcloud, better online servers , better design , cheaper , better performance @Mono geez. Change your profile picture. Seriously, you\\'ve got Patrick Star from SpongeBob Squarepants sucking on Squidward\\'s nose. That is so wrong. @abrahamWCE Jump Force, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot and One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows are available on Xbox One. For fighting games there\\'s Killer Instinct, Street Fighter 30th Anniversary, Tekken 7 and Mortal Kombat. @TwistedGaming918 THAT country doesn\\'t buy XBOX because the majority of the developers from THAT country don\\'t develop games that the japanese are fond\\n\\nAnd by not having many games from THAT country makes a difference in the world; if one likes JRPGS, fanservice titles, visual novels, rrythm or fighting games, XBOX isn\\'t your console @zezi mark definitely I don\\'t care even exclusive.. I just want to play the best game in a best powerful console.. Nobody:\\n\\nMe seeing my crush: 7:05 Konami: The grumpy old grandpa\\nActivision: The rich/greedy uncle\\nBethesda: The washed up father\\nEA: The devil How is Bethesda a AAA Company? Epic games store still hasnt added regional pricing for canadian customers. Im not buying anything off of that storefront until I see prices in CAD @Mono I have to agree with @mono, the security measure is generally a screen that asks you to input your DOB. Any kid with a brain that wants to access something they shouldn\\'t will bypass these control measures. It is up to the parents to regulate their child\\'s activity online. The companies only obligation is to let the consumers know if there is anything harmful to younger audiences in the game so parents can make the educated decision of should I or should I not let me child use this product @Mono The same applies to YouTube. It\\'s how they got sued by COPPA. Jack Ripple every publisher lets anyone play their games. That’s on the parents. The more hilarious is that Epic Games let children plays Fortnite. Need For Speed is still a good game! Even Battlefield, and Burnout! I’m glad Ubisoft didn’t make the list. Sure they’ve had some missteps, but overall they are still a good company. They are my favorite non American company. Rockstar and valve are tied for number 1 for me. Suggestions for ten most hated:\\nDirectors\\nActors\\nComic Pros\\nTwitter celebrities Ten most hated top 10s on watchmojo Politicians and Presidents. Me: I\\'d be surprised if EA isn\\'t 1st on the list\\nWatchMojo: of course it\\'s EA\\nMe: damn straight When the thumbnail is EA you know who\\'s number 1...🤣🤣🤣 The Modern Warefare download space requirements 🤦🏽\\u200d♂️ Me: “Nice list. But I feel like we’re forgetting someone....”🤔 \\n\\nSony: *slowly sneaks away*\\n\\nMe: “HOLD IT RIGHT THERE BUSTER!” I feel like Rockstar should’ve been on this list with the way they handled GTA Online 2k is honestly one of the worst companies next to EA. @Ladies Man, Incredible DJ ssj5 except 2K14 and maybe 2K19. They killed Ambed... @Zeephare their wrestling games sucked ass. Every single one of them I disagree. 2K only make sports games like casino, but EA killed many famous companies, some games were rushed (Mass Effect Andromeda) and published really bad games like last two Harry Potter games, The Simpsons Skateboarding/Wrestling, Catwoman, etc. Okay, so we\\'ve gone over what game companies we hate. How about those we love? 6:03 we have a great deal with microsoft BOOOOOOOOOOO! LMFAO 😂😂😂😂😂😂 EA haven\\'t made a single dollar from me in about 10 years now. NBA Live 09 I think was the last one I ever bought from them. 1. EA\\n2. Activision\\n3. Bethesda\\n4. Take-2\\n5. Blizzard\\n6. Konami\\n7. Ubisoft\\n8. Microsoft\\n9. ESRB\\n10. EA You forgot Sony and ND If the Xbox Series X does as badly as the Xbox One or worse, Microsoft is going to sell Xbox Game Studios to Nintendo of America. At least the Xbox one was still better than trashy PS4 because of game pass and backwards compatibility, elite controller, Xcloud , better graphics I hope that they do sell X Box to Nintendo so that they can finally do a good Concker and Banjoo Kazoie games @M S It a gaming joke. Ever notice that a company\\'s third home console either has a horrible launch or is a financial disaster for its creators?\\n\\n\\nSega Saturn\\nATARI 7800\\nNintendo 64\\nPS3 (Bad Launch)\\nWiiU (6th console but people count it)\\nXbox One @Jonathan Queen Third console curse? I would love to see Nintendo own Rare and Halo. “Don’t lie who’s been a fan of Watchmojo before 2020?🧼”\\n\\n(ɪ’ᴍ ɢɪғᴛɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏᴏɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ sᴜßs ᴡ/ɴᴏᴛɪs)\\U0001f90f You just spammed a bunch of comments this just misleading copypaste  and you need to be reported 🤔🤨🧐 Everyone forgave epic after they put GTA 5 for free on their store If number 1 isn’t EA, we riot It is, don\\'t worry, ma guy. As a fifa player. You do not understand how ea enrages me @ozmega and play what football game. Pes 🤣 Especially if you play on the Switch.  Apparently Switch users don’t deserve the same features that everybody else gets, like VOLTA and the campaign. so stop giving them money.. And for good reasons I may add. EA just entered the Chat! 😏 Watchmojo has been banned from EA reviews _My parents got scared when I say _*_Atari..._* HAZURE!!!! EA NEEDS TO STOP EVERYTHING \\n1. Stop making NBA GAMES(real nba players just had tournaments during streams playing 2k not live just give it up)\\n2. Bring back NCAA FOOTBALL(the lawsuit is over)\\n3. Take a break from madden(Make this whole department focus on BRINGING BACK NCAA)\\n4. Make another skate game\\n5. Bring back some of the “EASPORTS BIG” Games (NFL street,fifa street,nba street, def jam, etc.\\n6. Stop rushing the Star Wars games and trying to be different And just do what you know the fans want \\n7. Give the fans the sequels to game’s you know they want And stop trying new shit out \\n........whoever reads this did I miss anything About EA? The good video game companies I can think of:\\n- Rockstar \\n- Naughty Dog\\n- NetherRealm Studios\\n- Capcom \\n- Nintendo Not Capcom and Naughty Dog. Remove Rockstar because the problems are the GTA Online and Red Dead Online,microtransactions for using Shark Cards in GTA V,and milking GTA V for every single consoles(the new Skyrim). @no body you said it yourself:\\nREMAKE @Benjamin Peterson Rockstar might be bad with microtransactions in online modes, but their single player modes are absolutely amazing. Yes . Rockstar is getting good by milking GTA 5 over and over again by launching 3 gen consoles. And releasing Games after 100 years. That\\'s what you waana say..? Hold up Activision doesn’t do the yearly releases of Madden, that’s EA. Same with FIFA. And those games have plenty of gambling too. Top 10 gaming companies gamers love the most Glad Ubisoft is not here :D No, the China I know is supposed to be a country that fights for peaceful and freedom. Not becoming a Communist society. That\\'s not the China I have known. I\\'ll be honest, I was expecting Ubisoft to be on this list. And they learn from they errors like Capcom Ubisoft can be shitty sometimes but they have good games and creators Same I thinjk is impressive that nintendo manages to avoid being in lists like this even after so many years on business. people can not want to make game for it, but almost nobody hates them. considering that they games use to be great as well is very impressive I don’t think it’s really fair to put MS so high in 2020. They’ve done nothing but try to make gaming more accessible to people for like 3 years now and I don’t think you can find anyone who truly hates the company for any legitimate reasons in 2020. I\\'m surprised when someone talks about Konami, nobody mentions that the Yu-Gi-Oh card game  is probably the only good thing about it 😓 Well, this was depressing... The fact that it wasnt 2k at number shows this list was not thought of well and they don’t play many of these games Dishonorable mention: Game Freak @Belac Oak Four words:Pokemon Sword and Shield @Rhyperior Ranger Exactly Belac Oak they lied about why they cut Pokémon from the game. They said it was for higher quality animations but pretty much all the animations and models are recycled from the 3DS and now they’re coming out with a dlc that only lets 200 return M S how are thay bad? Yup... You know what\\'s crazy?\\nMost of the games i own are from EA but i had them before EA lost it the last EA game i bought was star wars battlefront 2 Ea are really money hungry.\\nIts nice to see that if you dont overdo a lootboxsystem like in apex (even if i think its sometimes a little expensive) they really can publish a good game. Shout out to respawn for not taking shit from EA snd just do the game they want.\\nPs. There servers still suck next, make a top 10 Game Companies Fans love the Most, and make sure to put fromsoftware and cd project red on top And yet we still buy/play their games. @Tech Triangle At least we can make the most during quarantine. Gamers are weird @Youlo King I won\\'t, but it\\'s true: we bash them all we want and STILL fall for their traps. It\\'s how some improve. Don\\'t speak for everybody lol Because we\\'re hypocrites and hypocrisy is our only virtue. Umbrella Corp nearly destroyed the world and wiped out humanity. \\nEA : \"hold my beer 🍻\" EA makes epic looks like an angel, and this is coming from a guy who loves fortnite and hates epic 90 percent of the time. Back to the era of 2000 -2008 when EA used to be one of the greatest video game companies, the days they actually cared more about their games. Now it\\'s literally nothing but a joke in gaming community. I always wonder what if PVZ isn\\'t made by EA. Cause i really like PVZ 10:07, holy shit , almost thought they put naughty dog at the top😂😂 This is the only time we want EA to be number 1 I wouldn\\'t say Blizzard is in a dire situation, They\\'re still doing quite well, Diablo Immortal was mostly due to fan overreaction and the few missteps they\\'ve had with stuff like Warcraft Reforged was exacerbated by excessive fan hatred regarding the China situation. It\\'s bump but in a few years everyone will forget about it. Capcom could have been on the list. thankfully they listen to fans now. I hope they continue to listen to fans feedback 2:45 Back when Symmetra was the best hero in Overwatch. Been having a nightmare in changing an email for my EA Origin account. It has my old email id which I don\\'t have access to anymore so need to change to a current one. Need to desperately change it!!! I can forgive EA is they are willing to make Need For Speed Underground 2 Remastered. Even if they did, I\\'m willing to bet they\\'ll screw it all up by monetizing the *HELL* outta the game, because really that\\'s all they care about anymore, money... ',\n",

He recently slammed their asses What about you head on a platter? Stay tuned because the world will have more black leaders like him!! Your ass is mad to see black folks succeeding in life. You  will burn with  massive jealousy very soon and we will raise up  like it never happened before. May God turn down our haters, Amen! what\\'d he do? Haha he realize he needs his salary now this is hilarious. This guy is the epitome of corruption Body bags part was absolutely sick. Feels like I might throw up every time I see this dude. starburst exactly, just last week, he told Trump to quarantine his political correctness, otherwise, he will see more body bags.  Today. He only said that because he knew that Trump already decided to hold funding for WHO for further investigation into their incompetence and corruption Your FIRED!

They\\'re both overrated WHO is a JOKE!! Stop the funding of that useless organization. @Bob Hildebrand Dr. Tedros, Director General of WHO, is a Marxist-Leninist and member of a Liberation group. This United Nations article places him with UN Secretary General and President of World Bank. Seems Dr. Tedros has brought Billions of Dollars to Ethiopia and in Djibouti energy products, hydroelectric and now oil and gas for China in Chinese projects and shipping ports. Seems a vested interest exists which China could use in their favor regarding WHO. So much money leaks out and so many favors made on such huge capital projects: https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/10/481952 @Bob Hildebrand  Human Rights Watch says the International Crimes Count and United Nations is doing nothing to stop the Millions of deaths and injustice each and every day by China including the 1.5 Million live organ donations of prisoners since 1999 and increasing even today. United Nations Secretary General António Guterres blocks any investigation, action or justice regarding China.

This guy used to speak politically, ie lying. Now that your salary is about to be gutted you have nice things to say about the US. Laughable. He just can’t shut up.  Can he? Master boot licker 😂 they don\\'t come as good as him I have so many boots in my closet call me Dr. fraud Corrupt bandit should go to jail and his team It shouldn’t continue and more than likely it won’t continue Dr Tedros! You will go to Capitol Hill and you will be questioned. Then you will be fired, after that you will be investigated and if it\\'s found that you colluded with CCP in a cover up of any kind then you will be prosecuted. You have failed at leadership, you did not have the courage to challenge China, you character has shown questionable ethics and you will be held accountable! FBI trump doesn\\'t has to? Ever heard of the ICC? You are just a mad dogs in here. We are millions out here to support him. He\\'s an excellent and outstanding black leader. The country so called Tawain can go to hell instead of him!!! He will raise and shine, of course y\\'all haters will get  hurt when you see a black man succeeding in life! WHO is an international organization, the US can\\'t prosecute him even if he did shit He is not a doctor!!! The funding has stopped 😂 WHO much like UN are just puppets to first world countries and don\\'t really care about welfare of everyone So who are the first world countries? Looks to me like they are the puppet of China. Who is paying you? It\\'s time to plug-in all the stops. 😑😑 No.. you out the WHO is a puppet controlled by china That first sentence didn’t age well Based on how WHO handled covid 19. I really dont think this guy is fit for the job. He should go. I am from the future and can tell you he is lying. Jail time, tedros! Keep China away from US. We trust you no longer 🇺🇸 Exactly cut all ties with the evil of the world China. Bring all of our jobs back to AMERICA. We make our own medicine, clothing ect ect ect. 🇺🇸 made in the United States and buy American 100% . It might cost a little more but it\\'s what Americans need to do. I am. Translation: \"I still want your money, Big Daddy!\" Who : thats racist because our boss is black! what\\'d he do? I honestly havent been following this very well Really? In ancient times, people like this were publicly stoned.  Today, we could “livestream” his departure.   A snake. WHO can stop this virus and save million people by recommend china flight ban but he said to not overreact\\n\\nHe deserve death penalty WHO evil Tedros\\'s family should ask him if all that money is worth it with all the blood that\\'s on his hands. He reminds me of Jar Jar Binks. He was placed in power to bring everything down. Me-sa know da way and you in big doo-do now! Somewhere Palpatine is pleased as everything is going as planned... Ooh boo hoo now he\\'s begging for forgiveness. Where\\'s his previous toughness eh? He’s worry about his paycheck. Is he high? 你还是主动辞职，来我们中国领狗粮吧 Tedros: WHO has good relation ship with china and we will never cheat china NO IT WILL NOT CONTINUE 👎 Not anymore HAhahahahahaha WHO exactly what is the philosophy of the virus? Because the virus didn’t just start in China its essence exists there most likely! Your problems are also most likely spiritually related to the virus! If you WHO tell people that we must live with the virus, YOU’RE FINISHED!!! NOT ANYMORE This man reflects the whole WHO which shows his association or inner circle is very corrupt! Has anyone been replaced? Who is advising you? Tedros was also health minister at a time when the regime was accused of covering up epidemics. \\xa0A cholera outbreak spread the region in 2007, infecting thousands in neighboring countries. When it spread to Ethiopia, the government simply renamed the outbreak and called it Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD). International organizations were\\xa0pressured\\xa0not to call it Cholera (despite the UN testing the infected and finding Cholera), and were pressured by government employees not to reveal the number of infected. Another stunning victory for the health minister.  https://hnewswire.com/whos-tedros-adhanom-should-be-put-on-trial-for-crimes-against-humanity/ Hungry for US $$$$$$$\\nSince Chinese currently will only able to use as getting general tao chicken The relationship is not as good as Chinas. Hope you don\\'t get not one penny! You let the whole world down He has orange on his nose. How’s that communist money treating ya? Today\\'s WHO cannot be trusted. So do n’t give money to WHO. He\\'s not even a doctor You will investigate by USA.. you kill million people, so many people lost their job.. 🌐 Shame on bias liberal WHO leadership a pack of liars 🤥.\\nPurposely or not, by praising China’s response to a virus the WHO first denied and then lied about, this longtime paragon of public health is fueling a ‘China versus the world’ showdown,” Adam Goodman writes in Fox News.\\n By enabling the Chinese government’s misconduct, “the WHO has become the new poster child for international organizations so bloated with bureaucracy and punctuated by politics they’ve turned into something well beyond what they were intended to be.” Shame on China 🇨🇳 and World Health Organization. Yes they both gave the World Coronavirus. Come forward and tell the truth now!! What do you know about china hiding the virus for so long and who developed the virus??? I lost my job and millions others partially bcs of you!! WHO put a Godam biologist as the director, which makes no absolute sense. IDGAF if this man holds a PhD in microbiology 🧫 he is not a an MD! Never went to medical school either. He kept quiet about multiple outbreaks in his home country of Ethiopia 🇪🇹. This Buffon should be in jail for crimes against humanity. He lied about how easily transmittable and infectious this disease was. Now WHO green lighted China to open up their wet markets, yet we’re still in a pandemic. WHO you shouldn’t favor China with any decision! You need to favor everyone! The obvious decision should have been to lock down China early on! But how many viruses have been released from China in the last 10 years and I’m mostly talking about the h1n1 which killed 50 to 100 million people from 1918 to 1938? Your behavior suggests that we need the virus! Big no no! If we need the virus one angel will give everyone the virus! We currently need China to conform to international common sense regarding open markets! Every country needs to fall in line with food safety standards! Major cities should currently be waging war on cockroaches and mosquitoes in their own house! Have you locked down the bats globally? The organization is good for the world but the ppls and leaders in the organization aren\\'t good they need to be remove asap and replace with good and knowledgeable ppls then everything will be good...please get a of group ppls come to serve the world not the CCP like this idiot guy!!! So the Biggest contributor of the WHO is the U.S but U.S is the most severe hit by the wuhan virus. What good is the WHO then? Give U.S a good reason why they shouldn\\'t withdraw their funding and put you on death row? Y\\'all have a little knowledge about WHO. He got no right to run your country. He\\'s doing what he supposed to do which is working on vaccines. Tedros should be ashamed of himself. Reminder that Tedros is not a doctor Classic Communism move to deny outbreaks and falsify numbers according the leading epidemiologists. China delayed even longer on the SARS epidemic which leaked from the Wuhan Lab back in 2004 that they did on their present COVID epidemic. President Jing Chi Jing of China and billie goats gruff gates will pay you not US Good job Dr Tedros NOT for much longer, apparently.\\nFREE TIBET\\nFREE TAIWAN @eyemall ears The Chinese PLA is stationed on Hong Kong island, I\\'ve seen the barracks myself - that IS Hong Kong\\'s military.  Hong Kong is part of China with a puppet Chief Executive hand chosen by Beijing.  And half the legislature is also chosen by Beijing.  \\nSo if you leave Hong Kong alone, then it will just stay part of China indefinitely.  Hong Kong and Tibet are both controlled by China Taiwan is a free democratic country that China has never controlled, ever.  That\\'s why Tedros is attacking Taiwan, because the Taiwanese can say or do whatever they want.  And he doesn\\'t like their criticism of his corruption, so he calls them racist\\n\\nTibet and HK are screwed, they are part of China and will stay part of China unless the CCP collapses Vernon Hardapple and leave HK alone! He needs a step down, we need someone pro-world not pro-China So, how did Trump get played by the W.H.O? Lol - wasn’t he the genius? Turdros just played himself. Trump is a genius while THE TURDO will now be giving blow jobs for a paycheck. Who knew the WHO was all about Blow jobs??? That\\'s news ',\n",

       " 'Canadian here, a parka is your heavy warm winter jacket (usually one including a hood with some fur around the edge) As a German, personally I associate \"Parka\" with an olive, military (style) jacket, as it was politically worn in the 60s or 80s, not made of synthetics, but cotton.\\nOfficially in our shops, every long jacket, winter jacket or raincoat can be a parka. Many of us would call a long weatherproof jacket an \"Anorak\" though. Brit here, a parka is exactly what you said (heavier coat, with fur rim round good). He held up a mac (most peeps in UK would say the same) Yess that’s what we call it in Scotland UK here yeah a parka is a big winter jacket @amazingabby25 left coast hehehe I feel like this has been causing Tan a lottttt of inner rage Tbh it has been for me lmaooo, even tho he did have a few of these wrong LOL he got so defensive after vest. What is called a cami in England, the American school system likes to call \"breaking our sexist dress code\". @laceyluzano INSPIRING STUFF Yesss! I\\'m a teacher, and I completely agree! I didn\\'t learn till I was an adult that we send the message to girls that it is their fault if boys are distracted. It also tells boys that if a girl is wearing certain clothes, she is asking for attention. We need to undo this! Until then, I refuse to enforce dress code rules that unfairly target girls. There are also rules that target Black students. We need to get rid of those, too. @Esme 404 You mean sixth grade? I dunno what your tryying to say aha In England schools, everyone has to wear a school uniform, except sixth form @Garret Van Wie Why thank you He didn\\'t say anything about trainers vs. sneakers. In England it is most definitely trainers and nothing else, in England @Granger Things we call jogging bottams joggers, well some people do in uk runners in canada californiahummus i call then shoes I live in Michigan and have never, ever said sneakers. Growing up, we called them tennis or gym shoes.  As an adult, I now say running shoes, because there are so many sport-specific shoes . We Brits call them Charity Shops usually - much more commonly used phrase than \"Second Hand Shops\".......and it\\'s \"a pair of trousers\" not \"a trouser\". Just like we say \"a pair of pants\",  and not \"a pant\". I think only the occasional fashion designers here says \"pant\" lol Scotland is the same charity shop not second hand shop I think he was referring more to the fabric? I’ve heard a lot of fashion people refer to plural clothing as singular when referring to the cut or fabric @homie93 in the fashion industry, \"a pant\" or \"a trouser\" are commonly used. You will hear almost every designer or stylist say this. Its not a commons people term so thats why a lot of people are confused by it well in America we rarely say \"a pant\" but it isn\\'t incorrect. Im sure its the same in England. Here we are, in our pyjamas, on lockdown, learning how to pair our blazers with mini skirts and sneakers Cristina N. That’s what I gathered lol meanwhile in germany: rain shield, hand shoes, wind coat, etc hand shoes????? In Dutch we also call gloves \\'hand shoes\\'. (Handschoenen) @Caeilia Windjacke gibts wirklich aber Regenjacke ist natürlich häufiger und auch windabweisend. HAND SHOES LOOOOOOL Lili ayyy yess German the only language to be more literal than America 😂 this should be renamed: Tan France hating English clothing terms for 8 minutes He british but love america more English clothes terms are way better in my term, but that is probably because i am british, and i have only ever seen the american terms on cringe americans movies so whenever anyone says that, like sneakers in an american accent, it is just.... .. like if anyone ever said sneakers in england, they would put on an american accent, really exaggerated one, and say it to make people laugh. Bt im pretty sure other countries mock our accent too I feel like any Brit I know would have completely disregarded american terms and just said the UK is always better that’s what we do Lol America is overrated @Maya Seligman yes, he be a traitor Us Brits are very patriotic to people outside the UK, but not to people who are also British Ikr I feel like this is tan just betraying the uk big time😂 Thomas Evans as an Indian I agree as well 🇬🇧 > 🇺🇸 It’s not called a brolly in the UK, brolly is just short for umbrella @Lizzie x7 yes Sanguine Vastaya - we always call it a brolly ☔️🇬🇧 @Elinor Vickers I remember that term - a gamp is always big and black. Its origin is a Dickens character. So pedantic lol In Newcastle it is called a gamp, or used to be. Im not gonna watch this video but I lived in England and I never once heard them say anything other than \"charity shop\" for a thrift store. That\\'s very true, but I think part of it is because most of our second hand shops are charity shops, however not all are. If they\\'re run by a charity then they\\'re a charity shop, if they\\'re just selling second stuff then they\\'re not Exactly!! Vintage shop in London, is exactly the same thing in the US As someone that lived there for half a year recently (and now I\\'m preparing for a long term visa there) you are correct. Thrift stores are the equivalent to charity shops. Someone in another section of the comments said that \"second hand store\" is supposed to be for used items but a step up in quality. Haha and he talks about vintage stores as though we don\\'t have them ourselves. I suppose he just wasn\\'t the type to go thrifting when he was in England. Why is this guy standing in Janet\\'s void lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @I Like Cats But I\\'m Allergic To Them it\\'s concluded When is that show coming back? 🥺 Gen Wilson me too 😢 I miss that show 🥺 Tan with American terms: Makes sense.\\nTan with Brit terms: What was the reason?! A lot of the terms are Cockney, are they not? @Esme 404 It\\'s not boring to be a part of Harry Potter bro @Lucy Vue exactly, brit terms make sense. I mean cloakroom vs coatcheck. Yay coat check? BORING! Cloak room sounds like we are all harry potter wizards Marie G The reason? It’s more fun! LOL Glamour: Tan breaks down American/British fashion terms\\nScottish people:\\nIrish people:\\nWelsh people:\\n\\nTan: sO thAt\\'S wHaT wE sAy in EnGlaND Well if it makes you feel better, we hear British as English. We consider Scotland, Ireland, and Wales as their own separate places and cultures. @Dani Ayala so why is the video titles british and not english? I think about this sort of thing all the time. They want us to stay? Except we don’t say it in england either 😂 \\u200b@S L Your occasional confusion is perfectly understandable but frankly for Tan himself (born in Yorkshire - England) to get this wrong is pretty insulting.  England is no more important or senior than Scotland, Wales or N. Ireland and although it\\'s been a common sloppy habit in the past (that only the English ever make by the way), in this day and age it should not be used to describe the whole country especially when the Union Jack is used as the symbolic flag here. \\nI\\'m English by the way but feel just as aggrieved as any Scot etc. because I\\'m also British. Uh Tan, even as a fellow Yorkshire lad I have to disagree with you on some of these. You\\'ve spent too much time across the pond! @Peter Masefield defo Whole-heartedly agree with statement. He has no idea.... A parka is a padded winter jacket with a (fur trimmed) hood in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and most places in the world 🤣😂🤣😂 So many of these British ones are not accurate for 90% of the population 😂 painnn I don\\'t know where you got the British versions but I have never heard anyone call a raincoat , a raincheater and I\\'ve lived here my entire life He never said raincheater I’m in the South-East of England too. In the 70’s we had Windcheaters. You can’t be that old.  Just a spring chicken @amelia yeah, maybe it\\'s outdated because my parents use arachaic terms. Nice to see a fellow south-englander on YouTube though : ) @Affadoodle Tigress Joint Account oh I\\'m south east and never heard it, thought it could have  been like some scottish, welsh or other country kinda saying America: sweater\\nEngland: jumper\\nGermany: pullover I was about to say jumper made the most sense, but it doesn\\'t, pullover does. But jumper sounds the best. I mean, you pull a *jumper etc* over your head, so thats probs why. But that is so boring, are you gonna call socks \"pull on\" now? Lol\\nJumper sounds cool, but that is just because i grew up using that term All 4 in England. Just depends on where you are and who you ask. Some terms are more common to different regions. honestly pullover makes the most sense @Lindy Clarke in Spain too Anna M the netherlands: TRUI As a British person living in the UK I can confirm that where I live we call trenches trenches and the jacket he said was a parka is actually what we call a Mac and a parka is a heavy winter coat, usually with a fur trimmed collar! @Anya Wilkinson second hand shop just makes me think of a second hand car shop. So we have second hand car shops, and charity shops for everything else like clothes and kids toys etc. Definitely!! Also, second hand shop? Yeah some people say that, but I hear charity shop a lot more. And we definitely say umbrella as well as brolly 🤣 Different people call it different things, I call it a trench coat keeva_d thank youuu Wellies is short for Wellington boots which were popularised by the Duke of Wellington. Wellies Tan really said vintage shop instead of charity shop, my inner british heart crying 😢 He hate British Hmmm. as a Brit, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever said windbreaker/ windcheater - looks like a cagoule to me He is just trying to be smart by knowing the proper name for things a cagoule? No, a cagoule is longer and drapes Also who calls trench coats trench? @DXRKE in my experience cagoule is any super light weight waterproof which you can throw easily over many layers and pack away tightly. Yep, that was definitely a cagoule I hate when these influencers say “Blazer is so huge right now”. Isn’t blazer a timeless item which is always “huge”? 🙄 @A Floating Pineapple yup Just school uniform init \"A\" trouser? A pant? Seriously? I thought they come in pairs 😄 Slacks , Jean\\'s, = pants short for pantaloons American terms are very straight forward meanwhile British terms are more unique and creative. I prefer UK terms I prefer british terms too @JW McCabe erm no, they are creative and interesting. Cloakroom vs coatcheck. Obviously cloakroom is a lil bit more interesting, just one example No, British terms are more uniform\\nand non descriptor It’s called a sweater because it’s thick wool and makes you sweat...here in Canada a jumper is a sleeveless dress that you wear over a shirt, it’s more like something a toddler would wear. \"And makes you sweat\" \\nNot gonna lie, that is a bit gross that you named your version of a jumper after sweat, im never gonna look t someone saying sweater the sme way again lol @Katie Chambers Playsuits in the Uk is like a jumpsuit, but shorts on the bottom half instead of longer legs. The dress would be called a pinafore or dungaree dress. In Australia we called sweaters jumpers, whoa really? I\\'ve never heard that term before. Is it a region specific term (I live in eastern Ontario) or have I just been living under a rock lol. @Autmn Leaf Yes...though the use of \\'jumper\\' for girls pinafore dresses is probably decreasing due to the internet and increased global communication. I had a typical American abroad moment when in London last year. I’ll never forget the awkward look on the employee’s face at M&S when I told him I was looking to buy a few pairs of pants for my dad since he hadn’t bought any nice ones in a while 😂 Yeah, well pants is underwear. I honestly don\\'t get it how americans decided pants was a good one to use TAN: You guys are usually right in the US.. \\nME (a brit): Tan you traitor!!!\\n\\n\\n(Jokes, obviously love ya tan xx) I caught sarcasm in that comment, because you can never tell an American anything different that what they \\'know\\' in their world. ;) (Canadian here) TRAITOR! British terms are da best Strange that playsuit/romper and sneakers/trainers weren’t included but diaper/nappy was??? Hmm I was waiting for the sneakers lol I\\'m triggered by the fact that he literally said \"a trouser\" and I\\'m not even a native speaker. I dunno if this is just regional differences but, Tan, so many of those were wrong?? \\n\\n\\nThat trenchcoat is called a trenchcoat in the UK, a mac is a completely different material. It has a hood and (usually) a zip, and the classic \\'mac\\' is the yellow one Georgie wears in IT.\\nI guess the parker is technically right but I\\'d call that an anorak, because parkers are the ones with a fur-lined hood, and they\\'re usually lined on the inside as well. Parkers be thicc!\\nHe\\'s right about vintage store vs second hand stores, but second hand stores are called charity shops because the only shops where people can donate their clothes are owned by charities. Nobody calls it a second hand store.\\nTrousers are plural Tan! But so are pants, so I\\'ll let you off on that one...\\nBrolly is just short for umbrella, we know that\\'s what its name is. Why does one country get to say what is “correct?” That’s absurd. I don’t tell French Canadians that their entire language is wrong. It is simply different. @extramedium1 wtf, not saying this to start an argument but did you seriously just say the typical arrogance of a BRIT not an american!? Lol that\\'s funny, almost thought you were serious for a second, good joke hahhahahah @extramedium1 what are you on abiut Elizabeth Robinson Tan certainly is multicultural however, he shows the typical arrogance of a Brit. Americans revolted. We are not a typical colony of your empire. American English is correct in its own right. It\\'s not because he\\'s British. It\\'s because he spent half his life in America and half his life in Britain and his ENTIRE life in the clothing/fashion industry I would hardly call Tan France \"one country,\" but okay 👌 He has so little idea what he’s taking about that it’s painful to watch this. Made it to 3:40 and gave up. Bad call, algorithm. Didn\\'t realise he stanned America so much, letting us down Ikr, i think the english terms make way more sense. brolly= short for umbrella\\nwellies= short for wellingtons Is anyone else just watching youtube allll day while quarantined???\\n\\nAlso do any small youtubers want to be friends and support each other? 🥰 absolutely Subscribe to sgfamilyfuntime JLe Vlogs me JLe Vlogs me It sorta bothers me, when he says it\\'s \"universal\", as if the UK and the US are the whole universe @cincysbest But really, just because in your case it is not like that, that doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s not like that at all. I had a friend who has been asked if we have roads in Europe . I am not accusing anybody in particular, but a lot of times people do think that other countries in the world are just less developed than the USA to a degree where they think we still live in the middle ages. But even just your use of the words \"you foreigners\" proves my point in a way. I am not saying all Americans are like that, but a lot of them are. @Ulaa YT No you people are just sensitive asf and just looking to be triggered. You do the same thing that you accused us in America of doing.  This particular video ISN\\'T about you . @Rainbow Ice cream You really don\\'t though lol. At least not in America you don\\'t. You foreigners are so sensitive it\\'s funny. @Aya Elizabeth I know what he meant I\\'m just saying he used the wrong word to describe it.... its because the two main types of english are british and american. so when he says universal he means in the english speaking world if that makes sense. hes not disregarding the rest of the world, hea just giving the universal english name as its called both in the two english’es’ doctor: “you have 7 minutes and 54 seconds left to live”\\n\\n\\nme: Me being Australian and confused for 5 minutes In Aus we call second-hand/thrift shops op shops. It\\'s short for opportunity shop. \\n\\nWe call them vintage stores if older pieces are curated together too. seeing the thumbnail: ITS A CHARITY SHOP In the US we also call that a SHIRT. When the captions say “ hello gramma  I am 10 France” The fact that that Burberry famously made the trench coat for British soldiers in ww1 and as a Brit I’ve never heard it referred to as a Mac My English teacher in 3rd grade: repeatedly screams: It\\'s always trouserS, just like glasses, you use the plural!!!1!!!1 I know in German we say \"eine Hose\" but they use the plural because it has two legs!!! (loosing his mind because 20 nine y/o just couldn\\'t grasp the concept) \\nTan France: A trouser, a pant 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ N. American English=pants.  UK English=trousers.  Fancy fashion speak=a pant, a trouser. He seems rubbish at the ‘British’ version of words.... and he was interchanging British, English and U.K. which are not all the same .... a disaster @Yigyigs Ohh ok its like kinda like calling usa the americas. But thank you it helped :)) aiemii i Britain is the name of the physical island mass, which contains the countries Scotland, England and Wales. Whereas the United Kingdom is given to the political union between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \\n\\nHowever, the problem with interchanging these terms  is that they’re clearly not all the same regions. And with all differences in regions, comes difference in culture and language. He should’ve just said England!\\n\\nHope this helps :) What\\'s the difference of Britan vs Uk i thought he said hello grandma in the beginning Basically the reason why you guys have words that “make more sense” is because with the English language it has been developed for centuries, words mixed with Latin, French, old English (which is actually very different) so that’s why it just doesn’t sound right however America decided to change their English to be more simple so things like tyre became tire, colour- color, jumper-sweater, (I’m assuming pants is an abbreviation of the French word for trousers- pantalon). To be clear, wellies are a staple in the UK and short for \\'Wellington boots\\' and I\\'ve never heard of goloshes I\\'m British and I\\'ve never heard most of the British terms 😂 American here (Ohio/Midwest)\\nI always just thought a sweater was called that cause it makes you sweat. Lol I believe it is called a sweater as it became part of fashion when people started to exercise for fitness, wearing a long sleeved heavy a top that you would sweat in. That is a bit weird that you named a jumper after sweat. You could say that brits named jumper after exercise cos jumping is exercise, so i will say that for the purpose of this. Would you rather wear something named after jumping related to exercise, or sweating related to exercise. If you say sweater i will be a bit......\\nBut that\\'s cool lol, don\\'t want to start an argument about jumpers or sweaters lol Okay but why did he say the trench coat was called a Mack. A Mack (short for mackintosh) is a waterproof coat, preferably yellow. the most obvious one is sneakers VS shoes.\\nAlso, a parka is a heavy coat with a faux fur/shearling lined hood, not that thin little jacket lol. You mean sneakers vs trainers?\\nShoes is the general term for all footwear In aus 🇦🇺\\nRain boots / wellies = gum boots\\nCami/vest top / tank top = singlet\\nThrift store = op shop (opportunity shop)\\nPants/underpants = knickers/ underwear At least you don\\'t call trousers pants lol, what were Americans thinking Renee Noonan or undies I love Tan he always tries to say his point of view in a calm way until he can’t handle it anymore, i noticed on the vest 😂 also in England we say umbrella it\\'s just brolly is short for umbrella i love how his accents gets more aggressive as the video goes on WHO ELSE HAS WATCHED *NEXT IN FASHION* ON NETFLIX?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust me? Ok... The Secret Doodler - Nope, I watched it & enjoyed it except I thought they did too many team challenges. It’s a sweater because you sweat in them XD. Gross, well enjoy your nice jumpers, the sweaty version i mean\\n(Also, just saying i mean this comment as a joke, no offence intended) I’m British, and the British version seems pretty inaccurate... 😅 When I call my sweaters jumper it makes me feel fancy af. 😂 Esme 404 thats funny. I guess some people would. 🤔 i cant help but sometimes say things in a very Oliver twist vibe lol If we say sweater or sneaker in England, it is only when we are doing that thing where we pit on an exaggerated american accent and say sweater and people laugh. But don\\'t foreigners do that about the english accent @Saint Artemis this made me chuckle Sapphire Blossom lol well yeah, if all your life you called it a sweater and then you switch it up to jumper people around you like friends and family would be like “what are you talking about.” Idk thats just me. 🤷🏽\\u200d♀️ Haha that\\'s crazy. Jumper is fancy?? 😂 i thought thrift stores were called charity shops in england\\nthey’re called charity shops for me where i live-\\n\\n*just me? mk bye* Nope, everyone in england says charity shop As an Australian, I am getting so confused with some of the terms that both America and England uses lol @ToriJaneIsAmazing lol @ToriJaneIsAmazing your not wrong there haha England and America: \\'proper\\' words for things\\nKiwis and Aussies: lets just shorten everything Love Tan, he is so wholesome! i feel like you got really technical with some of the pants and shirts. also \"a pant\" lol Starting to question if I’m actually British I thought a snood is like a decorative hair net/ covering Archergrl5 - my dad used to be a Civil War re-enactor when I was a kid & I used to go with.  Had the fill outfit including a snood for my hair.  Mine had a pretty bow & clipped in with a barrette so I could just put my hair in a ponytail & then stuff it in the hairnet & clip the barrette above the rubber band. What a cute human he is! I love his light energy and his humour 😍❤️ I\\'ve lived in England for over 5 years and have never once heard an umbrella being called a \"brolly\" this video is so faulse us brits dont talk like that!!! That\\'s not a mac, a mac is a waterproof coat @Cutequeen oh ok lol @water pop tarts My Grandma says mac sometimes, but we mostly say waterproof, short for waterproof coat,\\n\\nalso a mac computer is short for Macintosh which is named after a waterproof coat called a Macintosh A Mac is a computer\\nAlso do people rlly say Mac I\\'ve never heard anyone say that before... Actually, tighty-whities in U.S. are referred to as briefs. However, I do like the term Y-fronts. Charity shops is what I’ve heard them referred to in London. All those brits are gonna freeze to death if that\\'s the \"parka\" they bring to Canada in the winter LOL Yes but WHY is a trench called a trench? If it is military inspired is \"trench\" referencing the trenches? Yes.  The design was used by British and French soldiers during WWI, which was mainly fought in trenches, so \"trench coat.\"  Some design elements that are still popular today were developed exclusively for military purposes, for example button-down shoulder tabs, which were used to hold things like gas masks, gloves, or epaulettes (shoulder pieces that demonstrate military rank). Is it me or this kind of stuff is recommended for me during quarantine It\\'s called a \"sweater\" because people used to wear it to make them sweat while working out, which they thought would help them lose even more weight. Obviously much logical than jumper! In Australia this woolen type is called a jumper, and the sweat pants fabric type a sloppy joe. @Boh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣dude Although if you think about it jumping is also related to working out “I know that you call them tighty whities” 😭😭uhh no I don’t As a Brit in America, I agree with 99% of everything he said 😊🙌🏽 Except that i think the brit terms are better I have his autobio!! it’s so good, i totally recommend it ❤️\\n(Naturally Tan 😉) That Blazer reminds me of high school blazers Something tells me there were Americans behind the camera😂 Why in the world am I watching this ? Te amo,❤️ eres lindo para explicar y hoy aprendí algo nuevo, cuídate tu😊 the full name for wellies is Wellington boots Love you but The uk isn’t just England Tan! Scotland, Wales & northern Ireland 🥰 When you grow up with West Indian parents in America and had to use BOTH terms. 🇧🇧🇺🇸 I have never said button up in my life. Huh. And in Australia we use all these words completely interchangeably. *17 yo french girl* WHO WAS GOING TO TELL ME THAT SHIRT AND BUTTON UP ARE TWO WORDS FOR THE SAME THING I WAS SO CONFUSED FOR SO MANY YEARS This is the first time someone said English actually makes sense 😂 I\\'ve heard second hand shop before. Charity shop\\nCloak room\\nBam. Ive always called it a charity shop Yeah.. Yes and when I  was a kid we called the place to put our coats the coat closet. I don\\'t think he was correct every time... \\nI LOVE his shirt, tho... Fancy shirt lol Tan is adorable 😍 In Australia thrift shops are called \\'off-shops\\'. ah. I just love Tan. Okay so basically that coat thing wtf is a parka I call it a raincoat\\n(I\\'m British btw) i\\'ve NEVER used the word parka lol, and i\\'m english Same, all those words, just mean coat to me. Just different types of coats ',\n",

Not a very in-depth explanation on how they are built so quickly. @Alexander Köpke Really? You think so, I don\\'t. Considering the length of the Video it had an insane information density 1:53 wait the factories are pre made and put together on site? So theres a factory out there making more factories? Somewhere is a factory that makes factories with produce parts to build factoryproducing factories. It\\'s all a big circle of life :-) imagine if that factory was also pre made  so a factory making factories making factories making cars making people happy @Paul Frederick i \"think\" i heard somewhere that creating making larges amounts of something ends up making it cheaper. I dont know how it works and dont remember where i heard it so i could be entirely wrong @Shamir Fisher oh yeah having someone else do the work for you always reduces the cost because no one else wants to make a profit. there are kits out there for any structure to reduce your cost I really like how measured their respect is for the world around them. They aren\\'t so wimpy that they stand down at the first sign of conflict or resistance. but also they delayed building the factory by a few months because one of the trees that were in the way of construction because the tree had bats in it.\\nThey are massive users of cobalt (a horrible metal to source because most of it mined and refined unethically) but they have been trying to reduce their use, and are going completely cobalt-free soon.\\n\\nnot stopping progress, and continually adapting for the better of everyone. and let\\'s not forget, making a shitload of money in the prosses. @coolredpen Did you review the 2019 Tesla Impact report?  https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf  Especially the section on Cobalt Sourcing. @Greg Brance less of a complaint and more of a calling out of false facts that circulate around Tesla with no proof. You are allowed to be critical of some things you know @coolredpen Actually even if cobalt comed from the drc. It doesn\\'t mean it\\'s child  Labour.  \\n\\nThat\\'s illegal there. What happens is children next to the mine...mine the ground itself and sell the ore to the company... Because they are poor af and what would you do if you born in the hellhole of goma @coolredpen What are you going to complain about with Tesla after Cobalt is eliminated from Tesla batteries? They are legally not permitted by the authorities to clear trees during bat breeding season. It\\'s legally not possible, nothing to do with Tesla ethics Wait hold on, this channel had like 50k subs last time I checked the count :O What did you guys do? Holy shit congrats guys, love the B1M <3 Well they are no Mr Beast, but yes, people are interested in worldly building construction, and there aren\\'t many channels that discuss this. It\\'s quite simple ... just create interesting and high quality content which has a value for their viewer.  😉\\n\\n@B1M:  Love your Channel.  😊 @Riki Like you troll SUB BOT It has grown at an _electrifying_ speed. the blokes at Tesla are on a very good spiral🔥 Apparent speed in construction is the result of several factors including focused leadership, a huge team of highly qualified and experienced planners and managers, architects and engineers who are of the highest qualifications and totally dedicated to the task, and contractors with superb qualifications. Don’t forget a few other important participants. For example local governing agencies who are also capable of quickly processing the necessary approvals. By clearing away all the approvals and permits in a comprehensive manner months or in the case of California, years can be cut from the process. Many large scale developers now hire consultants and lobbies ya for that purpose alone. Another overlooked but critical component of this team are the off site manufacturing coordinators. These folks work behind the scenes, sometimes years in advance to ensure that the 1,200 manufacturing robots are designed and built so that the instant that the structure can accommodate phased installation of these devices, they are on site and ready. This also means that the utility (electrical power and control) systems must be similarly ready. This applies all the way down the line to the manufacturers of door frames and lay-in ceiling tiles. It is an incredibly complex and vital aspect of the success of the project.\\nLastly, please be aware that almost one hundred years ago a company used similar skills to build out of steel, concrete, bricks, stone and plaster the Empire State Building in an astonishing 18 months. More recent examples can be highlighted such as the Tudor/Perrini 24 months of construction that resulted in almost thirty acres of supported  concrete structure above a major and fully operation railroad system ready for the millions of square feet of high rise buildings, commercial structures and housing that is known as the Hampton Yards Project right in the middle of New York City. To date this is the largest project in the history of the city. I have thirty years of experience as the senior project manager on very large scale projects. I speak from personal experience in managing all phases of work from concept to ribbon cutting. I am not addressing in any way the Tesla personnel or internal management. My discussion addresses what it takes to pull off this type of construction success. I\\'m sorry but the modern leadership studies is a pseudoscientific junk branch of the business studies, invaded by liberal sociology types preaching inclusivity. If anything Musk\\'s focus on keeping only the most talented employees is the opposite of what the useless \"leadership experts\" are saying. I also like how you say \"apparently\", as if you had some evidence of this ridiculous claim. Their style of construction is really interesting as well as fast and convenient . This video is bland ... perhaps an introductory to a more expansive one. The happiness i get from refreshing and seeing you have made a video. Their factory was made on a factory that\\'s why its fast🤣😁\\n\\n\\nedit: 1:56 i guessed it 😃😄 Random fact \\n\\nIt is impossible to sneeze with your eyes open.\\n\\n-The Shades This video seemed a little light on content, Fred. Maybe you can find out a few more details? What construction software are they using? How are they able to do so much in parallel? How much local content are they using for building materials and labor? How much comes from Tesla headquarters? Inquiring minds want to know much more.\\n \\nThey refer to building factories as \"building the machine that builds the machine\". They\\'re obviously approaching the project as an engineering problem, not a construction problem. They approach all their engineering problems from \"first principles\", trying to find the most efficient solution using physics to analyze what needs to be done and in what order, and which steps can be done in parallel to minimize build time and investment cost. They claim that engineering a factory is 1000x to 10,000x harder than engineering the product that the factory is going to make, but there\\'s also much more room for optimization. Hey B1M, absolutely love this channel! Would like to see more longer format videos. Length doesn\\'t matter, does it? Just watched the last video and refreshed youtube and a new video is out! Volkswagen is scared ... He\\'s like a modern day Henry Ford @Joel F Depends on where you live.  Perfectly fine for me @acur 7819 jesus is another one... @VinceThe1 \\nAgreed.\\nBut the infrastructure needs to develop. @acur 7819 Calm down?

Is your life interesting? that narrator fella has trouble pronouncing his \"r\"s. TWO of my favorite things in one video: Tesla and The B1M. :) \"schools, prisons, hotels and homes\" - nice Hey guys,  first of all, very informative and good video! \\nAnd second, can you do a video, about reconstructions of old and destroyed buildings in germany?\\nFor example, the oldtown in Frankfurt or in Dresden or the Berliner Schloss in Berlin? It would be great and it is an interesting topic. I finished watching this video at an electrifying speed... If you\\'ve ever been to any of its gigafactories ...it actually DOESN\\'T build its factories quickly. It builds in stages, and designs the next stage of upscaling with each iteration/stage of expansion. Elon Musk is amazing,,\\nhe knows exactly how to touch target consumer, growing brand and do storytelling,, \\n\\nWhile leading 2 global leading and market pioneer companies having the bell clicked got me here with in 12 mins of up load! I really love the intro !!! Maybe let Elon take care of Berlin\\'s Airport CORRECTION: *german construction companies* (e.g. goldbeck) know how to build quickly, not tesla.\\ntesla knows what it needs, the rest is up to the construction companies. I assume German construction companies arent building the factories outside of Europe? Combination of both. Tesla has done a lot of their own design work to make the factories as quick to construct as possible. I have über respect for Germans when it comes to construction and manufacturing machines too. The production layout is made by the manufacturer( in this case Tesla). There must be some intrinsic advantage in their production layout and their budgeting that is enabling the construction company to do its job effectively.\\nIf the facility layout required many specialized pieces and custom dimensions for every compartment, there is nothing that a construction company can do to speed this process up( example: if the machines the factory has to house were of comically different dimensions and bear different loads on the building, it takes time to custom make all those rooms, but if all the machinery was of standardized weight and dimensions, the construction company can mass produce the required parts)\\nI just finished my college project report on the manufacturing plant of Jindal Stainless limited in Hisar and the main way they reduced the cost of production and made room for expansion is by standardizing the equipment. Large equipment was divided into several pieces of standard weight and dimensions. @Sachin Fernandoyup that how it works. I am really intersted in Tesla’s technologies and inovations but have no interest in purchasing their cars @: D ya it might be that I\\'m not used to it but it\\'s not so much about things one does or does not need. Like almost everyway to interact with the car is in the touch screen as it should be. But search the what the inside of the Rivian vehicles look like. It has a lot more design on the inside. Makes the space feel less like a completely empty room. I know some like that, but to me the style is kinda \"dry\". @TheAgentTexas I get the range and cost considerations, and they don\\'t have luxury interiors. But that they look super empty inside, I think may be that you\\'re not used to it. Why would you want stuff you don\\'t need taking up space? @H P Horses are cool Tesla using their cars for a cash cow to finance their final goal : world leader energy company, just look at their cars build quality and after sales services. They never serious being an automotive company, they never was. Ya, for me it\\'s the style and the range. The interior of tesla\\'s look super empty and not very comfortable. The range is also an issue still but that is slowly bring fixed. Then of course there is the question of cost. made my day again, The B1M\\nTHANK YOU!!!! Near my neighborhood in Germany roughly 100 new homes have been built in 1,5 years, with roads etc. all off-site made 4:30 he just casually slid prisons in that list lol Tesla should have built the BER Berlin airport... On the \"environmentalists\" slowing down giga Berlin: they are not real environmentalists. They are grumpy old people that are afraight of change, using some made up arguments to protect their little worlds. The real environmentalists in Germany are very much pro giga Berlin. The real answer is: throw a shitload of money where other companies can\\'t afford to let a building cost this much. „Germany‘s construction sector as a leader in offsite“... and this while the nearby Airport is due to open for over 10 years now... well many incompetent politics where involed and really made stupid decison which later came back hard 2nd to none, well done. First thing you need is dump trucks full of cash.  That gets things done quickly. Building all the prefab pieces isn\\'t being calculated into the build time. Before I opened the video, I guessed they 3D printed it! School,Prisons, Ah love how they come in sequence  and are true at same time! What a great idea for a video! Your content about specific projects are always great but I\\'ve really enjoyed your breakdowns of engineering techniques, processes and tools used to realize the projects in general. I\\'d very much enjoy a video about engineering solutions for architecture preservation - be it preserving very old buildings / bridges or bringing decades old structures up to modern standards (wink wink) One suggestion: When showing the Giga Berlin images, instead of just giving the date the video was taken relative to some religious event a date relative to groundbreaking would be informative.\\n\\nAnd in case someone wonders: 4 months. Germany is known for it\\'s impressive prefabricated construction methods. I wonder what\\'s stopping the government from giving them the final permits. They’re just following procedures and letting everyone voice their complaints and concerns. That takes time. Most of the main issues have already been resolved, like water usage or the foundations as mentioned in the video. Although I believe that had more to do with the soil composition being different than initially expected and requiring a different type because of that.

Why build factories outside America? Fantastic! So interesting 👌🏼🧱👍🏼 Hey Fred and Co! Keep up the great content! \"other repeatable building types like schools, prisons, hotels and homes\" - anyone else feel like they are just building prisons and using the same templates for everything else? This makes me wanna install Factorio again Great Content!!! Tesla to the moon 💸 I was expecting something more compelling...sigh I have so much confidence in B1M. They get a like before I see the video. Keep up the great work. 👍👍👍👍 This sounds like an ad for Tesla. One thing I don\\'t like about Tesla is that their whole company depends on lithium, and lithium is mined in South America @1:34 why do you pronounce the word \"develop\" very fast :) This was way too awesome. PS. Elon, if you happen to be reading... If you learn any great construction advancements in China so that we can build stronger, faster and/or cheaper, please do your best to get them adopted in the US & Canada. Our construction costs are simply way too high out here. Wow I live in Berlin and didn‘t know they are building a factory here 😅 @mk ?? why should it affect my rent. @TheMagicJIZZ Yeah and San Francisco is a tiny village @mk lmao do you know how big Berlin...is you\\'ll soon notice when your rent increases I want Tesla to be even more successful, until every car on the road is electric :) They should have built the airport in Berlin this way. B1m epic!!! B1m about tesla, heaven Something reminds me of block-type construction in post-USSR countries. The walls and everything were pre-designed and pre-fabricated and sent to the construction site, then constructed. This video was... electrifying good!\\nI bet the useage of BIM must have played an important roll! He should make in India also❤️ Amazing with Tesla in automotive innovation *The Elon*  is a man who has garnered my full respect. He speaks sense, and Truth as he sees it and embodies success in how he operates.💙🐱\\u200d👤 2 days ago National Geographic showed about Tesla in Made in a day B1M and Tesla in one video. My birthday has never been more sweet. 😭🥰😂 \"Autofac\"\\nPhilip K. Dick, 1955 That\\'s a definitive thumbs up Perfect!\\nFollow-up in 21, please! Hopefully the factories are built with better quality than their cars. How do you manage to constantly deliver high quality videos 😮👌 Here before one million views. \"Tesla\" is not a car maker!\\n\"Tesla\" is a technology company! @Rokky Renj Tesla solar roof, Tesla powerwall.... Man Tesla dosnt make anything other than car and charging stations https://youtu.be/Nkvea5BwDcE Gliga tesla real technology is them being able to help create a self driving car but in factor they will not be able too. full autonomous car is their selling point but in fact it’s really just a driving assistant Gliga you understand nothing that tesla has don’t has already been invented. they aren’t revolutionizing anything. they are jumping on the backs of things that were set in stone years before tesla started. gm and ford were revolutionary in their day and age but it doesn’t mean one is less than another. in reality the reason these car companies didn’t start using the technology that was available to them was because of the hundreds of years they have been open risk isn’t their prime value rather they need a bunch of small companies to take the risk and they then perfect their risk. it’s like apple and iphones. car companies and tesla are all the researching the same things only they don’t need to be first to make money anymore. Tesla is doing amazing innovation! Great video!🙌🏼💙 Mad respect for actually decreasing concrete by over 95% for a few protesters By bribing and coercing local officials, like any big company I\\'m not gonna lie, Tesla is smart, thinks outside the box, does what others wouldn\\'t dare, somehow that always work in the long run🤑🤑🤷\\u200d♂️ Every new gigafactory is vastly improved from the prior. Elon keeps saying the REAL product is the machine that builds the machine. Referencing to the Gigafactories. Gigaberlin will change how cars are manufactured forever. ',\n",

Well duh! Para The talking is kind of scripted. They review over the talking points so talking about fears would be a major point, Ellen’s team did research to figure out what scares them and hopes that they talk about it. There were several fails; I know this cos before I was born my mom used to work at a broadcasting company and got free bts tours all the time \"We\\'re still here....\" Where you at MGSV Fans!!

All of your videos was great Miss justine, i like it so much, it\\'s really helpfull for me, i\\'m waiting your next video :) +Shandy Rienatha thank you! thanks a  lot for precious knowledge Hi Justine,\\nI am in a moment in my life that I have to make important decisions about my career. I am not thaaaat young (33 yy) and I am already architect and urban designer. However I have never worked in my field of study (have been working as children\\'s teacher) because I couldn\\'t find a job. At the same time, I never really felt like really pushing myself to work with architecture and urban design. Recently I started to try different things that I always have been interested (painting, photography, cinema, fashion) in short courses, and by far when I did the short fashion course was the thing that I liked most and felt very inspired and connected. Meanwhile I was admitted to a master program in Sustainable Urban Design (which is something that I believe is very important for the future of the world, ett ett) but I can\\'t forget this will of studying and changing my career towards fashion design. I simply don\\'t know what to do, because if I decide to study fashion I will spend all my savings (I was researching schools and I was pretty satisfied with ESMOD, in Franca, but still not sure). I am really confused, I am just saying a lot of personal stuff for someone that I don\\'t even know hahhaah but I am feeling really lost :( i love your videos they\\'re very helpful thank you <3 I have ruined my eyes using computer excessively. \\nnow I can\\'t sit in front of computer for long hours. \\nI have taken admission in Fashion Design Course. \\nwhat should I do during job  ? Great suggestions. Thank you for this awesome video!! +Wrapped In Scarlet I am glad it helps! Thank you :* Hi Justin \\nI\\'ve seen ur videos which r amazing n full of knowledge... I\\'ve studied fashion designing complete 15 years back n after marriage whole knowledge went in vain... Now, due to some of the bad circumstances of my life I need to start my carrier in this line... Ur tutorials r very helpful but I don\\'t know where to go how shud I start my carrier in this line...plz guide me which books n tutorials can help me to start my carrier... Hello Justine! thank you for all these inspiring videos! \\nI would like to ask you if know some other way to take fashion design lessons,  meaning apart full time fashion school.\\nI have 2 reasons that i cannot attend a typical fashion: I dont have much spare time due to my day jod and i cannot afford at this period of my life to pay for a fashion school.\\nSo I was wondering, if there is some kind of open learning,distance learning, online courses/seminars etc. that i could attend?\\nThank you in advance for your time! +Katerina You should be able to find regular drawing classes in Athens where you learn how to draw people, then just adapt what you learn by making the proportions \"fashionable\" & by drawing poses. Since you are already in design and probably have a good eye, it will be easier for you  😉 @Justine Leconte officiel Thank you Justine.\\nI live in Athens, in Greece and my bachelor studies were in the design field in general (product,industrial, interior and so on..) but always wanted to get involved into fashion...\\nSo anyway,..I am actually taking pattern making lessons, I am already in the 2nd year but I am searching also some kind of way to learn how to draw fashion sketches professionally, and why not even get some kind of certification on that...\\nThank you though for your time! +Katerina hi, I don\\'t know in which country & city you live but you could try to find sewing and pattern-making classes in your city, on evenings / week-ends. Technique classes are better taken \"live\", not online (in my opinion). Then you can learn fashion history by reading textbooks. Some universities (usually in larger cities) also offer evening classes for working people. As for real online courses, you need to google in your country, in the language you would prefer. It is very country-specific... I hope it helps! +Katerina hi, I don\\'t know in which country & city you live but you could try to find sewing and pattern-making classes in your city, on evenings / week-ends.

Thank you for doing all of this. Uyen smith salam necaen Uyen Smith I went there and you will love it. Yes, it is expensive but you will learn a lot. Before I went to AAU I read a lot of bad reviews online but don\\'t believe it because I saw it first hand...those people gave up easily and didn\\'t take AAU seriously. Have you been to any of the fashion show? I think there is one in May...you should go and see for yourself.\\nGladys Palmer works there too, she\\'s one of the best fashion illustrator in the industry and also Simon Ungless (sorry if I mispelled his name lol) I heard he is Alexander Mc Queen\\'s friend and they went to school together. It`s been a while since I was here. \\nJustine I wish to know if you know anything about the fashion school of design in Sweden named \"Beckmans\" design school? \\nDo you think its a good  school to go to?

How expensive is life in New York? Something about flats in New York and how much it costs to maintain itself there? What with work in New York? How looks education at Parsons? Yess!! We want one from you Justine, your personal advice. +Unio Sa you will find all that information on the Parsons website. It also provides you with a budget calculation, have a look there 😉 the video proved to be very helpful...thank you so much...\\ncan you please suggest good youtubers with sewing tutorials for beginners , Wonderful tips. :) Hey, so i have a quick question. I am currently 16 and am planning on studying to become a fashion designer. The only thing is, i don\\'t know how to sew, and i don\\'t even have a sewing machine... Is it crucial to be able to sew, or can i design my garments, choose fabrics, cut out the fabrics, and then pay someone else to sew them??? Are there people who do that sort of thing? Same same Same I\\'m literally in the same situation,I\\'m the same age as you and I found out,especially this year that I\\'m really into fashion and I want it to become a part of my everyday routine but I have so much to learn and I don\\'t know what to do,I just started sketching some croquis but that\\' nothing...

But look at rankings & opinions from alumni, you will get a better feeling specifically for Italy! I’m in love with ur thoughts and the way u say hi it’s Justine 😘 really nice video \\nhi  Justine,  i have love for fashion design and love for textile making but am thinking of going to an institution to get better experience, d problem i have now is the schools here in Sweden  is said to feature on one but not both  so that means i rather study fashion or textile in different occasion and i don t know which to pick cos i have love for both. kindly advice me pls.\\nthanks  and best regards. +Justine Leconte officiel hmmmm... thanks a lot Justine I do understand all what u said and it make good sense to me i do apreciate. +mercy onyeukwu Hi! Difficult question indeed... Here is my personal opinion (others might disagree): I believe that fashion design gives a more global view & working on the entire process makes you become better creatively. And then you can take a few textile design classes on top, on the side.\\nIf you go directly into textile design, on the other hand, you might not know what textiles are used for or how the body works - there are fabrics that don\\'t work as soon as you try to drape them on a mannequin & then I always wonder what the point of such fabrics is...\\nSo to summarize, I would say that it is better to learn the entire process first (fashion) & then specialise into one area (textile, patternmaking...) at a later stage.  Fashion design also makes your profile more \"holistic\" so you would have more areas of the industry where you could get a job.\\nNow having said all that: if you think you still want to do textile, then go for it, be really good at it & you will have just as much fun! :-) hiee Justin\\nthanku you for this valuable video. \\nin the last couple of years , I have developed a keen interest in designing and pattern making. out of mere passion and interest I\\'ve learnt a lot of things from tutorials such as yours , books, internet illustrations etc. I can sew and make garments. but I don\\'t have a educational degree in fashion iv graduated from another field. I want to b in the fashion industry. could I get a start by doing a diploma in fashion designing? plzz help. Jessel Pires even I have the same question.

Hope you\\'re gonna answer my question🙂 Justine Leconte officiel thanks because answering my question💕 I\\'d say yes.. You don\\'t have to be the best sewer but you need to understand what is doable and what not, when you design a garment (and where it will need seams, etc.) Thank you very much u are really helpful. +Fairy tail mage 01 you\\'re welcome 😉 Do you have to train as a sewer to be a designer? you need to understand what is doable and what is not, so a minimum level of skills in sewing is required - in my opinion. Just study patterns. They\\'re very instructive. Start with the simple patterns and progress. Mix and match collars, sleeves, hemlines, etc. Sell in a few local stores and progress to larger stores. It doesn\\'t need to be complicated. wow..informative about fashion and design..i like design also..once of my talent drawing..thank you for sharing you\\'re video..

I have a question if i graduated from any another field except fashion designing n only learning online then  is there any scope to become  a fashion designer +Justine Leconte ya thanku so much n ur videos r really very help full thx 😊😊 +Pradnya sonar hi! Fashion design is applied art... so you need to apply what you learn in order to know (and really experience) what works, what doesn\\'t work, and how to find solutions when you have a problem with the construction of a garment. You need to try fabrics, try sewing techniques etc... Try to get practice to complete what you are learning online! Good luck! 无论如何还是谢谢你。 Thank you so much\\nAnd one more thing I wanted to tell you that I have watched your this video more than 10 times !! Hi I also want to be designer but from India and I want to qualify NID. 6h Wt should we study to become a fashion designer are they questioning the school were you studied? This is helpfully so that people know what they are in for. You are right about drawing. I am learning that drawing is crucial skills that extend beyond art. Learning to be creative is essential. Many people never think much of art or drawing but now that I am learning it I am having ideas and it applies to everything not just art. I think it tap into other areas of the brain. +athena energy Shine Definitely. The more ideas you get, the more new ideas they create. So in creativity, \"more is more\". That\\'s why practicing is key, it trains the brain to see the world differently... 😕 pasol nx boba ryza nx As being a Indian most of the people think these all r silly things \\nThat\\'s y i missed a chance of taking fashion as a carrier.... \\nBut I love to get a information \\nYour videos are a lot helpful \\nLove you so much 😊😊 Nupur khatri salam necsen Thanks..

I can\\'t afford fashion designing course 😢 there are few tutorials on youtube and on the internet in general as for drawing and sewing basics and techniques...I personally recommend reading books about fashion history designers etc...I know it\\'s very expensive to get a degree but if really want it you can achieve a lot of things yourself.Try to be persistant and focused and don\\'t give up on your dreams!

No need to be a jerk I’ve watched this video 10 times and I still can’t figure out who asked decion respect Like si te gusta esta canción :,0 good music \\n:,0 @Juan Gaming  ahora te secuestran el whatsapp :v @Carla Quezada para que quieres mi número @Carla Quezada q vrga @Juan Gaming si :v @Carla Quezada eres hombre The beauty of this song is how it sounds so innocent. When you\\'re depressed, you sometimes view your past self as a different person. Often when i think about my past happy self, i view myself as a child. Filled with innocent optimism, confidence and joy. It\\'s funny because I\\'m not an adult(I\\'m 14).\\nThe coffee part to me represents someone who is still a child, filled with optimism, trying to bring another child back to life. Mm yea 🔥 https://youtu.be/XPFE98wmz8c 🔥 heyy si men tienes razon uu <3 A lot of you seem to like invalidating people Bro age doesn\\'t matter mature matters and this songs makes me stress free Cadê os Brasileiros que gostam dessa musica Ata achei  que  eu era  o  unico  brasileiro  bom 👁👄👁 retire o que  eu disse Lost my husband recently.

O BRASILEIRO QUE VOCÊ PROUCURAVA Bem isso kkkkkkkk The feeling when your dieng but you dont want that person to be sad Why he look like the chef from ratatouille, and I’m not mad about it The saddest part of life is when the person who gave you the best memories becomes a memory.

It\\'s not all the 14-year-olds, some of these people hearing this may actually be on their deathbed, or have had to put on a happy face while somebody they loved slowly died. I can relate to this because my grandfather had cancerous growths in his brain, and with their positioning it was inoperable. We all had to watch as he lost use of his limbs, forgot how to speak right, and started forgetting who we were.\\nFor people who have been in this situation, it hits dangerously close to home. lachimolala audios it’s a joke Lol my 10 year old stepsister said the same thing 😂😂😂😂🤣 I\\'m no 14, I\\'m 18. but judging by the age isn\\'t right! coz you never know what a person is suffering from.

Do they teach geography in America? I’m sure 50% of Americans can’t name 2 or 3 countries in South America. They Didn\\'t Even know where the US was Those people don\\'t even know where their own country is. Depressing. @Erick Howard especially a country as large as the US Choice Username i can already tell you’re not American. It’s normal to refer to our country as “America” because you will never ever here anyone say the full name. It’s too long. Now if you wanna day the “Americas” then you’d be talking about north, south, and Central America. Even the people in the central and South American countries refer to people from the US as “americanos” because even they understand the context. It’s only people across the ocean who don’t understand the context. But I explained that way you understand next time. slainyy America can refer to two continents or a country, so they are correct @elisabeth dakak They should have been taught that in school. Better teach people than criticize them for not knowing my biggest dream as an european is to be asked that so i can show off my elementary school education @Cloudytearz Official :v @SillyRabbit Sillyrabbit i could tell you all 50 and i know their capital cities too @K0K0 FC did yp7 just say 130 IQ is standard in america ? Heck Im from Africa and we get taught that in primary school @Brooklyn Smith there were many smart people for exanple in germany and they were RACIST It’s crazy how many people think Africa is a country😂 @Bernardo Arsivenco In Spain, they speak the Spanish language like el Castillano, el Catalano, el Vasco, el Gallego, el Valenciano. In Morocco, they speak Spanish. We speak Spanish in the United-States, in most of the states. We speak Spanish in the Dominican Republic, Cuba (Caribbean sea) I mean, not all Spanish speaking countries are in america, but the other sentences are all right In my native country I was taught that America is a continent and not a country. All the speaking Spanish countries are in America.  I was taught that the United-States are in America. I know right lol I\\'m from Brazil. And I\\'m pretty sure 95% of people here can\\'t point somalia in a map, and I\\'m not even considering people that dont have proper education That kid at the end is plotting to conquer the whole world. Just incase he fails art school @Kales Monroe I unfortunately know plenty of people that are this ignorant @Choice Username joke Víkingur Sigurðsson or at least it is now, idk about before Víkingur Sigurðsson then why did you just say he probably isn’t anerican, kids around his age should be most likely to get it right since you must pass a test on the constitution and geography to make it past 7th grade and learning the world map is on that test from what I remember so it’s fresh in his mind The black guy saying Africa as a country broke my heart @eyan sorad I agree @Preston Garvey yeah panafricanism is racist but anyone should be able to locate countries on a map That was so depressing Ceuta and Melilla\\r\\nThe tiny Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla sit on the northern shores of Morocco\\'s Mediterranean coast. Together they form the European Union\\'s only land borders with Africa. ... The cities are a magnet for thousands of traders and menial workers who cross the border from Morocco each day to earn a living. @elisabeth dakak But are y\\'all white,or another race? I\\'m just  curious this should be titled: \"are you smarter than a 10 year old\" More like are you smarter than literally anyone under the age of -5 the kid is probably just a tourist from Europe :) haha He hardly said any countrys in europe Tiago Oliveira Portugal?  Eu tbm Or probably well educated Hahahah trueeeer “Which one is America?” \\n(points at China)\\n“This one” \\n\\n*starts ww3* Lol Thar was russia _soon it will be_ Want to start ww3:Point out at US\\nUS nukes US no，we Chinese like be that，we have 1.4billion people，we can vote USA become a part of China，LOL \"God who knows stuff like that\" \\nEvery European: \"Let me introduce myself\" Even me, a South American (we don’t really have a really good education) Asians: hold my knowledge I am Polish and I know every  country on the map + capital City for every country. There are continents other than Europe my dear friend Yep Americans: We\\'re extremely intelligent\\nAlso Americans: North américa* @CodeNameCheese Oh schiesse. Danald Sourdough jokes on you I’m not European >:) Europeans: We are better than Americans\\n\\nAlso Europeans: Don\\'t understand how insultingly fake this is Lol every normal person: knows at least what coutries are on their continent\\nAmericans:.....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3:00 well except this kid, he\\'s a tourist South, central or North America? The irony in the comment 😂 @Lukas G Like your implants...? me, as a kid, feel like we\\'re more educated due to all access to technology You know it\\'s fake right? Whenever you feel stupid just remember Americans exist Tyler oof someone else did not get the joke Yeah that’s why you’re commenting on Youtube which was invented by three guys who grew up in America and went through American Secondary Education and American Universities. You’re also probably watching this on a cell phone i’m assuming? Another thing invented by an American. Lmao. Californians Ha ha ha😂😂😂😂 Nate oof someone didnt get the joke \"Who knows stuff like that?\"\\nEuropeans: *Allow us to introduce ourselves* Littearly any normal person Mexicans: We know it by heart, that\\'s how we pick where to emigrate 😂😂😂 yea because only Europeans know Indians: we should introduce ourselves @Anne Chervinski hmm the stats by OECD show that the top performing education systems are in Asia though, including HK, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, China (SH), Macau in the top 10. Among European countries, there are only 2 standouts (Finland, Estonia), 1 in Oceania (NZ) and 1 in North America (Canada).\\n\\nEdit: Based on PISA 2018 No one :\\n\\n\\nNot even garfield :\\n\\n\\nAmericans : **Don\\'t even knew where is America** Nobody:\\nName a country?\\nAmericans:AFRICA...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcept for the kid ... Mason Russell they aren’t sovereign states tho which was what I was saying. In any case, my comment was clearly a joke lol that’s why I said “/s” lol َProtix  nah mate I’m a geography tryhard I could literally name all 196 countries right now if I wanted to @Harry Mcintosh greenland is not in denmark, denmark is in United kingdom damn Greenland is not a country but is instead an autonomous constituent territory of Denmark. Greenland, along with the Faroe Islands, though independent and with home governments, are considered part of mainland Denmark. A region with devolved assemblies, as in the UK context. Mason Russell lol \"No, who knows stuff like that?\"\\n\\nStudents, Foreign Ministers, Teachers, Principals, Kids, and a lot more... Basically the whole video:\\n\\n\"Do you know any countries?\"\\n\"Yes. Africa.\" Africa is a continent and not a country.

Why have we set the bar so low in terms of intelligence? 1:34 \"God who knows stuff like that\"\\nI hope she\\'s just joking yeah she that self absorbed... This has to be fake, people can\\'t possibly be this stupid @_ GTC _ stable genius... Obviously you\\'ve never been to America Sadly it isnt i hear they don’t teach geography in most (if not all parts of) america/us so honestly i’m not surprised It’s obviously fake because it’s a late night show where they need to entertain people so they probably just cut out every one who did name a country I’m honestly so relieved that Gen Z is the most educated generation in America, so  I’m counting on us to save us from this shithole😭 No we are not we cancel anything we don’t agree with @Hobostarr180 Well at least we don\\'t think free healthcare is tyranny But the U.S. isn\\'t that bad in regards to general ignorance of the populace They\\'re really not @Hobostarr180 lol right Host : \" can you name a country in africa ?\"\\nBlonde girl : \"No,who know stuff like that ?\"\\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Africans I imagine? i can just imagine this in 100 years\\n\"whats the capital of the USA\"\\n\"uuhhhhhhhh...   Russia\" It physically hurt when the African American guy called Africa a country I felt like I could finally breathe when the kid started naming countries Hey its the first night after the first debate 2020 and the only thing the rest of the world wants to know is when will that kid be eligible to be in charge of the nuclear weapons America has.\\nAt least that way if America does do something more stupid that putting Trump in the WH at least we know those weapons will be aimed at the intended places on the map. c10c4n he’s not European. Listen to his accent. He had an American accent and it’s clear. If you don’t know this then you are probably not a native speaker of English. If he was from Europe his broken accent would be recognized from a mile away. eyan sorad i was talking about that Greenland belongs to Denmark @Rayan only disabled dipshits cant name a country on a map @JoaKing_703 ok zoomer The little kid deserves a standing ovation, like c\\'mon! no wonder trump has been bombing syria instead of Mexico, and he prolly thinks india is neighboring to the US \"this is Iceland or Greenland\"\\n\"its alaska...\" God Americans are so awful at knowing anything about other country’s other than their own When Americans can\\'t even find their own country on a world map... R R that’s not my point, the thing taht makes me sad is that they don’t know that America is a WHOLE continent Manuel CB EEUU is not an English term mate. It might possibly even be confused with the EU  \\n(= European. Union ) lol  I digress, they probably do think the whole planet is the U.S.A 🤣🤣 nb. I know it was Spanglish ...all good ! Hahaha America is a continent America = Continent\\nU.S.A = Country *Points at Bolivia*\\n\\n“  iS tHiS sOuTh aFriCa “ This is why aliens aren\\'t invading Earth.

I am pointing out that you should be more appreciative of the US. Western Europe would have never recovered as it did without the Marshall Plan. z r - your question has nothing to do with what I was talking about. @Tyler HMmmmmMMMMmmm but a cell phone uses multiple parts,  the camera is German and the batteries are Italian and English and many others are European made. THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK GOOD SIR. Yeah that’s why you’re commenting on Youtube which was invented by three guys who grew up in America and went through American Secondary Education and American Universities. You’re also probably watching this on a cell phone i’m assuming? Another thing invented by an American. Lmao. “Shouldn’t I be taught this in school??” \\n\\nLady, you were probably taught a lot of things in school. Just what level of education do you need to point out which country you live in lol. The audience laughs because they are just as stupid America is Not a Country\\nIs a Continent.\\nUnited States is the country.\\n\\nSouth America and North America are SUB Continents Make them understand... Pointless effort Lol America can refer to the country in question in English and several other languages. \\n\\n The second part is not necessarily the case with how a lot of others are taught. Women: can you tell us a continent?\\nPeople: nigeria What are smart people in the USA called?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTourists So true Yep No dumbasses. America won several nobel prizes, but that’s because the scientific community is big and well funded.\\nThe average citizen isn’t that smart. Yup lol Wouldn’t it be easier to just say\\n “the United States” American\\'s geography is so weak 😂 . They should try to improve. Reporter: That’s a continent\\nCandidate: Oh my god Swear to god!  \\n\\nThat kid was a paid actor. I strongly believe America is just one big reality show for us Europeans to enjoy. Tristan Wolfe you’re 100% an american so I bet you dont even know where or WHAT europe is.🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Tristan Wolfe Of course they dont know the name, because the english name of the country sounds different from the native one. But you guys over there are just... weird. and why would start cheering that kid? He said nothing special but a bunch of countries. Funny Include New Zealand in the audience too @Greant3apanda where did he insult your english skills lmfao. you\\'re projecting your insecurity Can you name a country “Africa” that’s a continent. “Oh” they don’t understand do they? You know it\\'s bad when they start clapping Why almost everybody is  getting right about continent Africa? “Who knows stuff like that?” My friend in junior high memorised the entire world map The fact that Americans can\\'t locate their own country is really stupid as hell. @rams dankha even if it is the subcontinent with less countries, its something xd Daniel Piza I don’t know man I would say 50%  but that’s just me being hopeful @rams dankha which is 3 countries only. How many can name at least 10 countries of America? @Alejandro Garnika If you knew anything, you\\'d know that \"Americans,\" nationally identify as: \"Americans.\" Further more, in the English language, \"American,\" literally means, \"... The United States, or its inhabitants.\"\\nIt should have been implied, but I guess not. Good luck in life my friend! Ironically, it *is* stupid to believe the people in this edited video intended for comedic purposes, accurately represent \\'Americans.\\' Whenever I feel stupid, I come and watch this and feel much better How are people so stupid😂 Those of us thinking “wow I could totally do that”, yeah we probably could but then they’d leave us out of the clip Name a Country \\nAmericans: *Africa* “Who knows stuff like that?”\\n\\n*_literally everyone who’s not american_* @Ar Pendragon Lmao soy europea. Aquí te enseñan que hay dos continentes, y puedo decir lo mismo, que a ti te enseñen que halla uno no quiere decir que sea lo correcto. No hay una definición aproximada de que puede ser considerado un continente y que no, así que cada persona puede decirlo como quiera y seguirá bien. Such an useless person Yeah exactly, it\\'s not my job to be able to name a country. Rifin 0895 yes @Carlos Silva so the word “American\" is the same as the \"European\",\"Asian\",and \"African\" but from different Continent,right? The American girl that said \"USA is the big one\" it\\'s the most stupid person I\\'ve ever heard, for real Where is America \\nLady: Putin?\\nFBI: Welcome to the American Gulag When you can list tons of countries and want to flex your skills on these people.....🤦🏽\\u200d♀️ @iyla You hot but he desperate Frankie Mazzei no 🙃💅🏽 Iyla if you give me ur number then ur an absolute god 🤣😭 Natsu Dragneel I’m confused asf @iyla Did you understand what just happened? I\\'m confused🤣 Americans: \"We are the best country in the world!\"\\nAlso Americans: Don\\'t even know ANY other country\\n\\nAmericans ... please don\\'t be too proud of yourselves :3 lol Plot twist : The kid was a European tourist. @rinas well no, the first education system was invented by the Xia Dynasty in China and the first modern school was opened in Massachusetts Dankosity 2 it’s not. Europeans invented schools😐 @rinas hey man, that didn\\'t sound racist at all The Science Man well europeans have invented the smartest things in the world so if it wasn’t for europeans singapore wouldn’t be that smart.😐Don’t flatter yourself TheBravest 23 Ooo that’s an interesting comment 😂 Ignorant? Wait they don’t know there own country America What the hell ? I wish all that people have been there to see the lil kid at the end The only continent that I’m still confused were are the countries (location) is Africa, and now this just made me want to study more geography \"First of all, I\\'m American, I don\\'t HAVE to know anythingg\" “Where’s America?”\\n\\n*Points to Russia\\n\\n... As a Russian am ashamed 😂🇷🇺 They’re American, pay no attention to them 😂 🤣 our country America:🤦\\u200d♂️\\n\\nRussia:🤦\\u200d♂️ 1:05 he’s not the smartest but he seems so sweet Its funny when you’re British and watching this — except the haunting memories of trumps last visit I love how the CHILD knew the most like I know more than all those adults 😂 Yakko\\'s: *look at those stupid mortals!* this is exactly how Europeans see Americans welcome to our world @Damn Cat do you want a cookie and a blue ribbon? @Nathan Torres the fact that you believe majority of Americans are like this because you saw a few cherry picked individuals on a couple of youtube videos shows just how ignorant you are, how do you guys not understand this? while you use the internet and platform we created.. The rest of the world, I would say. @Damn Cat Your spelling is awful!! This is actually, genuinely saddening This must be fake or I am the smartest 10 year old in the USA I know all the  countries. @evex 31 Americans you mean and a capital letter for the start of their names since they are a noun. (I\\'m a New Zealander so good education.) I am canadian and even kids here are more educated then americains You must be good in geography but you will  definitely will fail in maths 2:34\\n\"Is this one Europe?\"\\n*points to Australia, probably one of the easiest to recognize*\\n🤦\\u200d♀️ This segment should be called...  \"No, Africa is a Continent\", or \"Name any continent\": Interviewer: Can you name any countries in Africa?\\nPerson: God no, Who knows stuff like that.\\nThe rest of the world: 👁️👄👁️ TNT yes except as an American, I can safely assure you that the very large majority of us can name a relatively large number of countries and point them out on the map. And if you think that this video isn’t either fake or at the very least highly selective, then I’m sorry, but you’re kind of an idiot. @Channel Name lots of people can names countries, the hard thing is that you have to point it out on the map. Sure, you may not remember where other countries are, but at least you have to remember where you live, apparently people on the show can\\'t even do that. @Pearl of Africa Rgypt, Tunisia, Libya, Congo, South Africa, Chad, Zimbabwee.  That is all I know other than some of yours.  Australia is the easiest, then North America, then South America. Uganda, DRC, Sudan, South Sudan, Central African Republic ,Togo, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, SA, Nigeria, Niger, Benin, Egypt, Mosembiqu , Tanzania, Swaziland , Cameroon.

As an English as Second language speaker, I really enjoyed his lilting inflections.\\nI have no ides what his accent is among british dialects but I understood everything \\nhe said and the whole episode was presented very well.\\nI hope I can Understand your accents if I meet up with you where ever you may be\\nfrom. It completely ruins the video. Why is he speaking like that? @Sam Stevens no...he referrin to this video and the comment section...this video was posted to youtube and available for comments 2 years ago. No one said anything ab publishing or first screening day😲😲 @goodcat1982\\nYOU\\'RE fucking annoying, my friend. Hello from Panama 🇵🇦 I had to study and summarize this interesting video for my British History and Culture class. Regards. Brilliant!! Great lecturer!! Good to hear a narrative without drowning music in background!!👍once again first class!! Simp much? And yet they still haven\\'t evolved in Essex 😆 Stop fighting amongst your brothers Never have. Never will. They only came up on to dry land last week. Give em a chance. 😂 Because the guy from YouTube its wrong! Great watch but the voice reminded me of American Pie movie. \"This one time at band camp.\" “Heidelbergensis “, the “g” is hard, Bloody humans coming over here taking our jobs 1 million years ago! I’ve seen BBC documentaries on this subject that were far less informative than this video at twice the length. Great work! @Robbie Knight Where does this hopelessly flawed concept even come from? The BBC are (and have always been) a blatant voicebox for the state. The vast majority of the employees / subcontractors are white. English, middle class people. Like most of the profitable rackets, the govt have had the BBC in their pocket since their maiden broadcast. Shit BBC probably said we were all from Africa and black lol. BBC is anti white and anti British/English. Zach Higgins Right? Yikes... TIL the U.K. is infected with idiotic ultra right wing cult rhetoric just like the U.S. Rush Limbaugh and Fox News have so much to answer for. @Stringy-bark creek I certainly realize it and that\\'s why I raise my whiteness to a whole new level and flaunt it to the extreme.Remind people they should say thank you and just be grateful. “They were called Homo Sapiens... they were Uz..” @ᚱᛰUᛠӖᚱ ᚦᗩӖϻᛰᚤ U WOT M8 I SWEAR M8 ILL CLUB YA Neanderthals are still very much alive, especially in South London. WE WUZ UZ The British cut off from our homo sapiens during the last Ice age we are now called Homo-Sarcastic Why is everything this man says a question? @Jude F. I think it comes from Australia, annoying . Sounds like an old 45rpm record going funny! Han Liu it isn’t bc of an accent and his accent isn’t even scottish/irish I think it\\'s just Scottish/Irish accent... it\\'s not that bad The subject was interesting but the inflection in his speech is frustrating and I couldn\\'t listen for long without screaming stop talking like that!!!! As a Yankee, I found this presentation to be fascinating. Thank you Imagine being on Doggerland as it was slowly being swallowed up by the sea and knowing that your descendants were going to die there. If only the habitants of DOGGER ISLAND could see what DOGGER/DOGGING means today lol lol. Or, imagine watching the giant wave coming towards the land and knowing that everyone will be dead within moments. 10,000 videos with 0 subscribers You don’t have to try to hard to imagine it. The British Isles are in that position now. \"Archaeological Record\" not \"Fossil Record\".  Artifacts are not fossils.  Other than that, I think you did a fairly excellent job. @myadorablefosters You will note that my reference was to _complete_ specimens. The majority of the analysis of complete specimens has been conducted on La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 or the \\'Old Man\\' skeleton and the Shanidar IV skeleton. This has given rise to the early 20th century assumption that the genus broadly suffered from rheumatic conditions. My point is that basing any thesis on such scant data will always produce inaccurate results. @ᚱᛰUᛠӖᚱ ᚦᗩӖϻᛰᚤ they\\'ve extensively studied many specimens, some so closely that they\\'ve been able to recreate their facial appearance and hair color. I\\'m not sure what decade you\\'re getting your info from. @ᚱᛰUᛠӖᚱ ᚦᗩӖϻᛰᚤ Not even remotely true.  Now for many human species there is only one type specimen, not true for Neanderthals.  There are thousands and thousands of bones and specimens.  It’s the most abundant sample size of any non-sapien human species. I would agree with the _fairly excellent job appraisal_ . \\nBut ....\\nThe dominant theory as to the physical characteristsics of Neanderthals has been based on a single specimen. This hominid relic has since been identified as having suffered from a congenital spine wasting disease and can not provide typical data for the entire genus. I wish history was this interesting in school! 😊 Can\\'t even imagine though,the REAL struggle they had,just to survive on a daily basis! We today,take too much for granted. <3 thanx so much for sharing this video. @izqa a Quest for fire it around 80,000 BCE I recomend the movie \\'quest for fire\\' also there\\'s awesome documentaries on history channel and netflix about various historical topics. Enjoy 😊 They had to work together!  That\\'s humanity\\'s strength Thank you for this series, very informative !\\n\\n\\n(26:25 Age of Empires II music is gold ;) ) The intro music is from CK2 I noticed that too? I\\'d recognize Shamburger anywhere! Captions have there moments \\n\\n\"And his Son Charles,  who\\'s struggle with Power mint would end in Civil War\" This is absolutely wonderful - thank you so much for the time and research. Fascinating stuff! Found my new channel to listen to when going to sleep now!! Loving it!! Good to know I\\'m not alone in this 😅😅😅 😂 Thanks for a great show and loved it, We even loved our Dogs back in the stone age,This buried dog was found with 2 dishes, Seems strange we use 2 dishes today 1 for food and 1 for water, weird eh! We got past that whole \"man went into woods and domesticated wolves\" thing years ago. It\\'s much more likely that the smarter wolves started hanging around encampments to get easily acquired, cooked food. As long as they didn\\'t display the _snarly face_ they were tolerated for their added security. Seven generations later, their behaviour would be what we consider _tame_ . The dog had his favorite water and food bowl with him. That\\'s touching. Fun fact: Happisburgh is actually pronounced like \"Hays-borough\" or \"Hays-bruh\" :) its doing my head in???how he keeps ending his sentance as a question???its starting to get annoying??? @Dave Hallett no it isn\\'t Question everything, mon!? Or the answers will win you over!....? One bang: Put subtitles on if you are really that pignorant.... @Dave Hallett NO?! Is it a welsh accent   does anybody know When neanderthal was perceived as black before DNA proved otherwise neanderthal was not called human by the British museum Poor neanderthals I was just thinking that. They used to view Neanderthals as savages until it was discovered that they were white Love the look on that man\\'s face. He looks like a lad. 0:11  To be fair, little did they know that they lived on a globe. When looking for a parallel story line the oldest evidence comes about western European territories being populated by the eastern empires and by the Greeks (using natives in a similar way to the XV century to stablish territorial posts in the new overseas territories). Afterwards as human groups remained disseminated in those lands the Romans started consistent population and organized citiy systems in the western territories. The oldest building style in Britain ( including the tall towers away from the ground) come from the old Roman military but in a way discconnected from the time line of the rest of the continent. It could be that it was because Britain was far away from the Roman life or because the Romans used the Island for exiles. 2:35. A foreign invasion? As opposed to what? A domestic invasion? Good point... My thanks go out to the creator of this series. Thank you from Texas! Beautifully done. Inciteful, intelligent and artistic. Very well done. YOU are AWESOME. 16:00 maybe we are seeing their broken chipped stones. The Neanderthals used them heavily Good to see recognition of the Sentantii. Time after time sites seem to be ignorant of this people who have a fascinating history. I love the Age of Empires music Me too 😄 I noticed this too! I came here to see if anyone else picked up on that. 10s of thousands of years: new rocks\\n4-6 thousand years: iphones What a joke right What a brilliant, well informed video. I enjoyed every minute.\\n\\nWhat I love about this video, is it really blows my mind with regard to time. To us, 1000 years is a ridiculous amount of time, but then when you hear the narrator talking about tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years, it’s so hard to get my head around it all. The first human in Britain built a hut, this second one refused planning permission and tore it down. Meanwhile a few thousand aristocrats still own 1/3 of the land in Britain. @Frank DeFalco 1067 to be exact  MATE. Shalom.\\nWIKIREDSTAR \\n\"SOURCE OF TRUTH AUSTRALIA \" ....Rufus Chucklebutty....still no planing permits for tiny homes..nothing has  changed mate. COOOEEE COBBER. \\nWIKIREDSTAR \\n\"SOURCE OF TRUTH AUSTRALIA \" @Frank DeFalco was he related to Bjorn Lůcky? Frank DeFalco Bjorne Epstein? Is that a joke? He sure as hell wouldn’t have been Jewish living amongst pagan heathens lol. So he wasn’t Jewish. 30:17 According to the museum near me in Florida, the local natives had the same atlatl spear technology.\\n I wonder if it was devoloped independently or if its extremely ancient technology that comes from a common source? I think it may be a possability the stone ciircles in Britain  conform to Egyptian measurements , suggesting a wider knowledge source  . Always when i see this kind of video\\'s i dream away. Thinking about my mixed ancestors, those neanderthals and homo sapiens. Thinking what they were doing, who he or she was and what he or she liked and did 🤔😴😊👨🏻\\u200d🏫 @Jauffe Jauffreson True. Whites did not come from Africa\\nNothing in Africa is like us  -  We are not like anyone in Africa To point out, they were most likely Cro Magnon and Neanderthal, African types didn\\'t reach us until after we had our own languages and cultures. It was tribal warfare from there on out. Homo-sapiens did lose a majority of the time due to Cro Magnon\\'s mastery of survival, and Neanderthal\\'s intelligence and strength. Check out the bear-cults. This was a pretty odd period of time, and it all gets weirder. Same here.  And I would bet those ancestors had fa r more knowledge than the \"experts\" would have us believe 😊 Q: how can those who lived here after the ice age, closed off from mainland Europe be the ancestors of the Saxons, Angles and Normans ? Robin Johnson think better. they aren\\'t the neanderthals were outbred and homo sapien sapien became you... I was thinking this species might be the black race. 9:15  i can see where the sapiens got their looks. Love how you use the age of empires music Loving the stronghold music! I\\'m a great believer that modern man has been around for a lot longer than we know. @vivec the not false god You can\\'t even stand under the sun without burning.\\n\\nA simple rainfall can trigger pneumonia.\\n\\nA single winter dropped the population of virginia from 20,000 to less than 500 people in 1637.\\nBears hibernate man couldn\\'t...\\n\\nAnytime you have to adapt to an environment you are foreign to that arena. @Raymond Palmer but it did happen for man, that\\'s how we\\'re alive, we are native from Earth, we have no evidence to state otherwise while we have millions of years of closely related ancestors. @vivec the not false god You\\'re not indigenous to earth.  Evolution works on the premise that each generation builds resistance to the nature pressed upon it for the betterment of the species.   It never happened for man.\\n\\nWisdom hath but one source few dare dine at his table.\\n\\nAs for hair which human lineage are you referencing?   There\\'s several ecah with different origins. @Raymond Palmer wat? Bruh we lost hair because of clothing, you actually series? We have hair on our genitals, head, legs, and arms, as well as facial hair, and, yes we can go outside barefoot, it\\'s just that we wear shoes so much that our feet aren\\'t used to it, go barefoot outside for awhile, your feet simply don\\'t hurt anymore, we can\\'t see in the dark because great apes sleep at night, our species is closely related to bonobo chimpanzees, don\\'t be an idiot. @Thomas You\\'re seeking answers but don\\'t wish to reveal your stupidity in asking for them... Thank you for this! This was interesting, and enjoyable. He does a perfect impression of Stewie doing an impression of Brian\\'s girlfriend Gillian Lol James Mueller “ Damn you, mother! Damn you and your estrogenical tyranny!! “ \"What the deuce\" ... 1:26 - music - memories kick in. \\n\"Site your granary sire!\" We\\'ve come so far and yet we still havn\\'t answered that one really important question, \\n\\n \"What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" What\\'s your favourite colour? 42 @Sarah Winterbottom You have most wonderfully and gloriously,  missed the point my dear. If you were facing the pit of doom, you would care. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? Answer the first two questions before we continue here ... So good information and all but the upward inflection on every sentence is pretty damn annoying. 22:50, Shakira’s Greatest Grandmother. I was thinking the same thing 😆😆 15:06, those look like modern day Brits. Really enjoyed this! Filed in a lot of gaps for me. \\n\\nBrilliant job, well done! I disagree with your use of \\'unite\\' in the introduction. The guy from intro picture looks like Gareth Bale version of English early man 😅 Damn this was fascinating to watch. Don\\'t mind the narrator\\'s inflection, I enjoyed it all. Great video, keep up the fab work! Found out on ancestry DNA 🧬 that I’m 82 % From England London Wales NorthWestern Europe 12 % Irish/Scottish 6% Native American In the thumbnail, I swear that\\'s my mate Dave from Orpington. Looks like him Clacton on Sea discovery .... for mine, I\\'m going to go with early prototype of a baseball bat \"The humans arrive\".... oh crap. 11:15 Age of Empires soundtrack?^^ 🦁I think of i lived there with mammoths, saber toothed tigers and smaller scavenging animals🌱 id find a really thick strong pole, sharpen the crap out of it and keep it with me at all times💨 I think that\\'s probably a spear. 🐺🐗🐅🦁 Who\\'s playing Age of Empires in the background though? Gee X me lol Saw the thumbnail, Thought it was a nice selfie Dogger land? I thought that was in the car-park behind Tesco\\'s on a Friday night. \\u200b@janis vogel what about white females? If they breed with muslims and black males, they tend to produce loads of children. That’s weirdly specific there... Which Tesco? i need to know. For research purposes. What you are probably referring to is a tradition that arose around the time Doggerland had vanished. It was introduced to recover from the huge losses in population numbers. This one time, at Band camp 😆 Great video. Really like how you put age of empires music in the background, suits the narrative I like to have all the material before I get started..... Sad they never seen it finished!😂😂😂 Good documentary, also good to remember there is aots of speculation here... there pretty much has to be. This one time.\\nAt band camp. I didn\\'t read this comment until after I wrote mine.  Credit to you.  You got it first, but holy smokes!  What led to this? @Steven Britton In all fckng fairness, nearly ANY-one could do better than this (who isn\\'t a Californian) @What \"But I know I\\'m going to  punch a hole in my laptop screen if I keep  watching with this dude\"\\nHahaha!!! That made me LAUGH SO MUCH!!!!\\nSo true though - it\\'s VERY annoying. @Vit Sono On listening again, you\\'re right, can\\'t think why I didn\\'t spot it before! Ian Mansfield Wrong. He’s Liverpudlian Thank you for taking history back many thousands of years. Most people are of the belief that it all started about 6 000 years ago. Well done, how much is fact and how much theory we might never know, but it makes a lot of sense. @Peter Bessant My response was to the video. \"A History of Britain - The Humans Arrive (1 Million BC - 8000 BC).\" Christians believe in the Genesis creation that happened about 6500 years ago, as they work it out. The video and the history, my words: \"but it makes a lot of sense.\" Sorry, I was not clear. Thanks to alow me to correct. Most people believe it all started 6000 years ago? You can\\'t be serious man 😂 @arostwocents The official definition of a theory in the scientific method is: \\n\\n\\nan explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested and verified in accordance to the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement and evaluation of result.\\n\\n\\nThis is the definition the scientific method works with. A scientific theory is the highest standard of evidence, homologous to fact. Some details may be off, but the general picture is fact. @D it really does not. Theory means a theory. Some are definitely true, which are known as fact. *Hypothesis. Theory is the highest form of evidence in science. It means it is definitely true, maybe some details are wrong, but that\\'s it. \"temperatures could plummet to -10 degrees\" - such a shocking difference to today are you being sarcastic? Love the content, real good production quality; but man... I\\'m really struggling with this upward inflexion in how he speaks... What if that land bridge remained to modern times? Maybe a completely different history. Very fascinating to watch and the narrator was very clear on what he said, very informative, love documentaries like this, now to find another one. Thank you for posting really enjoyed it. Doggerland, the Holy Grail of late night carparks 😬 22:50 Shakira\\'s ancestor As someone who missed history at school, I found this fascinating.  Thanks Were I the narrator I\\'d deliberately pitch-rise every sentence now just to annoy the moaners. That\\'s how i\\'m reading these comments. Isn\\'t it called question intonation or something? hes masterbating while reading This Neanderthal looked like British men with Neanderthal characteristics. We have such amazing history in this country it’s just astounding some of it Is that ck2 music I hear 0:45? Well done mate\\n2:30  Stronghold pc game? \\nHaven\\'t heard these songs in ages, right in the childhood Every video seems to assume and assert that the country we call Britain is, and was, what we call England. Not true. The people of Orkney were \\'civilised\\' long before the south of England @Jim Aspinall Aye mate heard that ane before,  4 different campaign\\'s over 150 years \"wasnae worth the romans time\" John Maclagan , mostly Irish in Scotland. To be honest it wasn’t worth the Romans’ time maintaining a presence in what we now call Scotland . Not much wealth or precious materials. Just built a ditch and a wall to keep the locals trapped up their. At last someone who knows that Orkney was built before Stonehenge,  the fixation with southern England when talking about \"British\" stuff grinds ma fucken gears.  The Roman Invasion is the same,  they conquer the tribes in (England) and call it Roman Britain - 4 different conquests into Caledonia,  2 walls and alot of dead Romans they decide to retreat - aye good move boys French and engish have a very difficult and complex history The time we’re you mentioned summer temperatures were camparable to preindustrial levels not today’s as globally temperatures have rise by more than 1 degrees.Apart from the information was correct. I like the Age of Empires music around 26:00 Very informative, but the upward affliction in the ending syllable of a mid-sentence pause makes me think of a teenage girl trapped in a grown man\\'s body thunder tick ✅ Heh.  Once noticed, you can\\'t avoid noticing it. I don\\'t understand what the big problem with the guy\\'s voice is. @Nik Robinson it certainly is you numpty.... @Elsie Hannam it\\'s not an accent to say free instead of three... that\\'s just stupid. @Elsie Hannam Its not the accent they are talking about! I agree, some people are just bored idiots. As much as I like the USA they do not realise we have lots of accents and pitches in our Islands, plus various ways of pronouncing a lot of words.Maybe some people would prefer Larry the cable guy to narrate this for e.g. It\\'s. just his accent. Leave him alone. Idiots.... 26:42 got to love the age of empires Sound track making me want to play some Age of Empires. 22:48 looks to me like an ancestor of Shakira 😂 I seen one that looks like nick jragger. At least he knows people of Europe where a sub spices and when the 3rd move out of Africa mixed with them That man at 3:14 looks suspiciously like a roadie for the Stones... Loads of peecee in those faces! This chap must be a BBC wannabe. @14:38 I still see members of those species hanging around starbucks and brunch cafes. 23:47...We have seen the enemy.... and THEY were uz ',\n",

I wonder if the “plans” for the pyramids are entombed underneath the Sphinx. It’s just the crook Zahi Hawass (head Egyptologist/archeologist) would never let people search and claimed nothing is there. In all honesty though, if he was selling genuine 4500 year old Egyptian artifacts, he has probably been down there and destroyed the info on how they might have been built. He literally gave a statement one time stating that we now know all there is to know about ancient Egypt as if that statement holds any kind of merit. This was much less informative than I expected.

Everyone knew how to do it. It was common knowledge. The Stone age lasted thousands of years, hence they developed many methods to cut giant stones.  There are plausible explanations how these feats were accomplished you just choose not to believe them.\\nExample of moving enormous stones with no technology: \\nhttps://youtu.be/E5pZ7uR6v8c\\nAnd you can find lots of videos showing how to quarry giant stones @Jakobite _TA A high technology civilization that builds with stone? So after the information age, we go back to the stone age? Once we develop carbon nanotubes, graphene, high tensile alloys and etc we decide that stone was better? @Patrick Ryckman I believe that the Egyptians knew the wheel, while a few slightly thrown words in stupid articles claim that the Egyptians did not know the wheel.\\nMy arguments are as follows:\\n1. The wheel was invented around 4000 BC in Mesopotamia - it is probably impossible that in 1500 years such another did not reach Egypt, when it reached Europe at the same time.\\n2. The Egyptians used the potter\\'s wheel from around 3000 BC - that is, they knew the potter\\'s wheel and did not know the wheel?\\n3. The Egyptians were able to build a 150-meter building, it survived 5,000 years, and they did not come up with that the wheel is spinning?\\n4. Do I have a pyramid, they used beams on which they rolled boulders to build - that is, again they came up with the fact that round beams were rolling, and they did not bump into a wheel?\\n5. 3000 BC the entire Middle East already rode chariots, and yet the Egyptians still did not know the wheel?\\n\\nAnd last 6. its fact Sahara wasn\\'t a desert. Why do they portray their country in hieroglyphs as fertile land, green land, agricultural crops, animals, lots of water? They lied? No. They didn\\'t lie, scientists still dont know why the Sahara became a desert, only it is known that the rain monsoon moved further north, but it isnt known why it happened.\\n\\nA bit academic dispute, but worth the commission, because in my opinion more and more people are repeating such nonsense that makes no sense to reason.

Or this would had been a giant prism to obtain rainbow energy🤣🤣🤣🤣 The Egyptians used an analog 3D printer to build the pyramids. tupac shakur you are right bro I wish I was they moved it with they minds most humans can’t do this and it would takes hundreds of years to build half Best explaination so far (lol) @Happy Thoughts no the pyramids perfectly aligned with the stars and the it is at the centre of the earth not only that it has perfect precise cutting and angles and they covered it with limestone to conduct electricity for their merkaaba you dont know anything about egypts pyramids the egyptians were much more advanced than us at a spiritual and frequency level George Mason thanks for the paragraph, altho I could also read a whole book instead of reading the paragraph of a comment u took probably 5 years to type :) Isn’t that just a bunch of dudes, some blueprints and blocks?

You don\\'t need them. 0:11, actually the Great Pyramid is superseded by Lincoln Cathedral. Jagadeesh Kumar you are correct..... what he means is still standing structure. Because the Lincoln Cathedral was destroyed, and now only stands 83 meters tall. That\\'s quite impressive though, that something built 4000 years ago is still standing, and 3000 years later, we could only build something that lasted 200 years. I\\'m actually curious if our modern skyscrapers will last longer than the pyramids, I have my reservations because we never intended skyscrapers to last without maintenance.

I was learning about about agent Egypt in the pyramids when the king died does it actually live there in 1980 I joined a tour and spent 10 days in Egypt at three different locales.  Of course, we spent the better part of one day at the pyramids and even went inside Cheops, which is the main one.  A truly impressive experience. As my dad would say, “It was aliens” Henrico Joubert  yes hehe Cole Gabos And giants😂.

You got me there 😂😂😂😂nice one so the answer to the click bait is : \"dunno\" If you d have a beard You will look like Jesus :) So beautiful! It’s easy, they were just in creative mode. I did some research and there was a giant mummified finger found near the pyramids and I believe these structures were built by giants That sounds interesting, can you provide the source? See guys? I told you they were made of limestone. Hhj BBC us @Bryan Masquemin\\n\\xa0thats what he said in the video but after reading... limestone was used more than granite so yes. @LotusEater Built with limestone is more correct, considering the majority of the pyramid was made with limestone, was coated with white limestone, and the most material used was limestone. Granite was only used to cover the outside. @BruceWillakers\\xa0 limestone on the insides he said. The outer stones are still Granite. So the pyramids are built with granites is more correct. @BruceWillakers\\xa0Scarlet Blade (Played it for the Plot) is more educational than this . 3:54 go do that on mona lisa (hint: not while any guards see you) *The question is how much does it cost to climb the pyramid??* Thank you - Let there be light -\\xa0\\n\\nWhen pyramid\\'s erode\\nWhen its twilight breaks\\nForgotten in total\\n\\nWe will feel its pieces\\nThe smallest of particles\\nWhen they are inside us\\nWhere they belong I believe they were built telepathically...you cant do that in any way we know of. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lasCXujNPfs\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tBXTnDPpiA\\n\\nWe do know actually.

They where put together by flex glue This is such a good video. Thank you for sharing your experience and knowledge. It was great to see how you came in on a camel and had to negotiate a little with the tour guide. I liked how you showed us close climbing around the pyramid and the quarry. It was fun being a tourist through your eyes. Same music as in the game Exiled Kingdoms, lol! \"They\" charge me $3 to climb the rearmost of the three pyramids (on the back side so the guards couldn\\'t see us). Who charged you? instead of dragging a block of  stone one by one why didnt they just drag the whole pyramid across the desert. they would have finished it in one swoop @Teh Quacken 😂🤣😭 Or you could simply carve three hills of sandstone, carve the steps, then add cracks in the steps to give a fake appearance of individual blocks, thats not a new idea  . . . . as its already been done. Gacha & Undertale FOREVER r/wooosh @Mechanical Hermit like granite baby ha That would be cost efficient lol Hey Dr. Derek! Always been a fan of your channel, and I thought that maybe you could add some sources in the description so as the video fits better with the rest of your channel I thought about time traveling to Ancient Egypt then I realized that I would probably end up killing nearly the whole population because did some sicknesses that i carry and barely notice or have been vaccinated for 4:07\\nFor fast answer Hey once you must visit India..\\nThe land of wonders😍 Clearly the Egyptians were Minecrafters. This sounds like an insult very funny sounds like you’ve been watching a little too much AvE I really enjoy your channel Veritasium! Awesome channel and I\\'ve learnt so much from your insightful videos. I wonder then, on this subject, you\\'d be willing to investigate further? You mention the use of the flood waters when floating the granite stones from Azwan to Giza. A monumental distance to travel that does shine light upon the age old question of; Just how did they transport such heavy blocks to Giza? The use of flood waters is now resonating with me for an even more simplistic, yet ingenious solution to the actual building of the pyramids. Please see this video from Chris Massey\\'s book - \\'How they REALLY built them\\'. \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1y8N0ePuF8 -\\xa0\\n\\nI\\'d be really interested in you speaking with Chris - a construction engineer - with a fresh look at the \\'secret\\' that needs solving.

No definite answer but the video makes you think. You can leave if you think it\\'s a time waster Wondering and asking the right questions sometimes is as important as answers That was a good laugh. Thank you for that. The reason for which the Great Pyramid was built perfectly illustrates the desire and determination of the people to leave a trace of their passage through this life and the construction of the Great Pyramid for the Pharaoh Cheops represents a symbol of eternity! \\nRead the book on the site  www.thegreatpyramidofegypt.com   in English or Romanian\\n (NO MONEY) and comment on the book , photos with models made of wood and brass board, drawings and sketches commented by the author of the book and logical explanations ?!? motivated by the construction of the Great Pyramid of Egypt.

I think Bumblebee and Optimus Prime is hidden inside the walls.. No one would ever find them.. There have been some big breakthroughs in reverse-engineering the pyramid construction. At-least for the biggest one.\\nA) A series on internal tunnels have been discovered that were used to pull rocks up on a slope without having to build a giant external ramp.\\nB) Worn rocks were discovered that suggest a pulley/crane system was used, where the slope of the pyramid itself was used to hoist the heavier granite rocks up the side, The Counter-weight would slide down the one side of the pyramid as the cargo would slide up the other. Yes indeed, they also found an ancient FedEx cargo vessel on the bottom of the Nile River, delivering them 70 to granite blocks from the Aswan quarry. how did they get the hoist down and the counterweight up for the next load?

Just to see if modern technology granted us the ability to do so. @Tony So but the principles of structural mechanics don\\'t change and as long as you model it properly, designing won\\'t be hard, especially with the software we have. It may be time consuming due to scale but really not hard. We\\'ve gone beyond statics being an issue when it comes to design. Dynamic systems are the in thing at the moment. @karthik rox You know, the pyramids are more than 4 or 8 sided structures... And if its so easy, why havent anyone recreated them, or one? @Tony So I don\\'t have to do anything to know for a fact that it isn\\'t hard. I\\'ve been around enough civil engineers to know the tools we have can easily handle modelling the structure and choosing suitable material based on the stress distribution. @karthik rox Sure, why dont you make a video about it, since you make it sound so easy. Make sure to get the inside correct to. @Tony So dude, the pyramids are no complex lol. It\\'s relatively easy to model, you could run a stress test on a simulation program quite easily and choose whatever material handles the load and fabricate accordingly. With the transport systems, energy, machinery we have, it\\'d be quite easy lol. Whilst i find this vid believable .. i at the same time find unbelievable with how clever it all seems they hadnt realised to use trunk rollers just by seeing stones roll when pulling heavy rocjs ! 🧐👍✌️ I still think it\\'s freaky that you have a clear view of the pyramids while you eat at the local Pizza Hut....

Fort Minor, M Shinoda, Styles of Beyond! shout out to my boy mike shinoda BRUZ liked the video because of THE LIBERAL GOVERMENT Feels bad, I\\'m currently studying Town Planning. Is it good? I\\'ve noticed a lot of town planning in new suburbs lately seems to just perpetuate the use of cars and support big name stores like Coles, Woolworths, Bunnings, etc. Is there town planning these days?? ... THE LIBERAL GOVERMENT I\\'ve got a friend too, Jordan. but do you have FOUR? bs don\\'t believe you Yeah I don’t believe you lies 70% sleeping\\n10% chores \\n5% trying watching youtube while my cat is blocking the screen \\n5% online classwork @Jeremy Billett 10% living in your head. I think the other 10% already has a use. You should do math with the other 10% Jordan flexing on us with his one friend Autistics cant make friends..... fake news + One more than us pre virus 75% work, 15% sleep and 10% everything else\\nnow 35% sleep, 50% YT and 15% everything else Incredible how I’m 35 seconds in and he hasn’t even finished that first sentence since his split-character mania takes over and interrupts himself 😂 Dude, take the consultancy gig. \\nF* the gigging life, lugging gear loading in at 8pm loading out at 12pm getting home a 2am, for a couple of beer tickets, constantly writing new material. (you know how this goes) music and or musical comedy is an 80 percent endeavour, and probably ruin your family life. And it\\'s only got a short lifespan before people get over your act. Besides, you had kids, you\\'ve handed the torch, your dreams are now hobbies. Take consultancy and make music YouTube videos on the side. PEACE! 90% study at the moment. Graduate in 4 weeks though. Outside of that... Heh, well, not much 🙃 @kippers12isOG I\\'m just whinging hahahaha, I have a lng-term goal. Neuroscience is very fun and I already work in that area :) Hit the ground running once you graduate. Get something in your sights and start moving immediately If you never put anything out you will never see any result.\\n\\nGoodluck x wow, uploaded 1 minute ago, i may not have a life anymore ArgrusGaming how does your life/time percentage look? 1:54 THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT Friendly jordies is like a talking family guy episode LOIS DONT TAKE THE KIDS Jordan, the only person to give me homework to make my life better Sorry Jords you\\'re sounding like someone who just read a self help book whilst having an \\'up\\' bi polar episode? I bet you saw Yilmaz... Would love a deeper vid on your thoughts about careers in the public sector and how one could apply these principles to improve it and oneself working in it. Definitely yes Bruh moment\\n\"did you know that?\" The advantage of having a child to Jordies is to provide incentive to work harder, jesus christ. What is with the ads bro? Is lord farquaad running low on coins? 🤣🤣 Play music just added to the value. Now they are forcing a migration to YT music (which I hate) it\\'s down to avoiding commercials as the only payoff for having a subscription. Still think it is worth it though, just slightly less so now. There is a trick to wiping out YouTube ads..\\n\\nBasically fast forward with your finger past the ads then rewind to the beginning .. dot leapfrog if you will @Sean - P in the golden age of internet piracy? Skrrrt Who doesn\\'t have YouTube premium these days? If you regularly use YouTube, it\\'s well worth $8 to $11 per month IMO Im up to seven! Was just about to click off and you literally called me out by name with the \"cool it charlie\". Freaked me out g. \"They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn\"\\nSeneca This is good advice. I feel like this aim for \"comfort\" attitude and \"follow the well beaten path\" and play it safe attitude is something my parents encouraged. As a result I have more money than most people my age but it sure as hell isn\\'t fulfilling.  Will definitely be taking it to heart. “Don’t have friends or hobbies” yeah nah Buddy full time dad fitting in getting back into welding, fixing my 2003 VY SS. Oh and a bit of time debating anti science idiots. Also this Friendly Jordies bloke has been filling my Tube feed. Oh mate, what took ya so long? Think about how much more time and money you would both have if you got rid of those commys. Not to mention poon older than 15. Same, except replace VY SS with VE SV6. \\n\\nSick car though, ngl. Is it yeww green? He said the line. Thank you Jordy. This is something i needed to hear. I never take any risks in life. i feel that i don\\'t have the ability to prevail and to take chances would be for nought. It doesn\\'t hurt to try, it\\'s just difficult to harbor humility when things don\\'t work out. I would be at peace living off the interest of millions of dollars of investments with my wife and kids on my own land away from the city. @kippers12isOG I would spend time with family, play video games, write little stories, play d&d, and write occasionally. I\\'d probably also pursue scholarly pursuits at my leisure. Basically, retirement. What would you do with your time? You’ve only outlined some of the pieces. Without hobbies or purpose, that life quickly becomes miserable, in my experience Instructions unclear. Became a stoner druggo and played with guitar pedals on shrooms for two years Bruh I already AM a stoner druggo tryna make beats in my bedroom all I need is two years worth of shrooms and im off to the arias :D lmao This becomes really hard when you have kids because if I quit my job to focus on what would give me comfort, I\\'d have pressure from all sides. I want to do it anyway but I\\'m not sure I\\'m ready yet. Australian man says he can \\'quit anytime he wants\\' - continues to advocate child abandonment. What he proposes instead will SHOCK YOU. oh finally someone who gets me. i spend 90% of my life on work as well and would happily have it be 99% the other 1% would be sleep hahahaha 80% sleeping 20% friendlyjeordies and drinking Very insightful. By the way when you giving us the video on queensland elections? Jordan I gotta say it dude, I appreciate you. Thanks bro. Aaagh my life\\'s shit except for time spent watching friendlyjeordies Jordan is a BUDDHIST STOOOOGE I appreciate the premise but i think taking a percentage away from time spent on music is a mistake. Do some research on the benefits of music on cognition and mental health. In fact, I\\'d go as far as to say that for some ppl spending a few hours a week on music is the most important use of time. ok you are literally the voice inside my head but for the love of god im too depressed to start my dude For a while there I thought the first minute was an outtake from the Goon video ... I can recommend the \"Demartini Value Determination Process\" in this context (it\\'s free to take). It greatly helped me to clarify my own (conscious and un-/subconscious) priorities in life, etc.: \"What are Values and what is the Demartini Value Determination Process? Values arise from and are therefore determined by your conscious or unconscious voids, in other words by that which you perceive as most missing. What you perceive as most missing (void) in your life therefore becomes what you perceive as most important (value). Your underlying private voids drive your overlying public values.\\n\\nYour fulfillment means the filling of your perceptually empty voids.\\n\\nThe hierarchy of your voids determines the hierarchy of your values. The hierarchy of your values determine how you perceive (what you selectively attend to) and how you act (what you selectively intend upon) in your world and therefore they determine your immediate destiny. Since your values change over time, your destiny therefore changes over time. The summation of your series of destinies determines your evolving life journey. Your ultimate or relatively unchanging core value dictates your infinite journey the most. Your transient, changing, crusted hierarchy of values dictates your series of transient finite destinies.\\n\\nThe more important a value is - the higher it will be on your hierarchy of values and the more discipline and order you will have associated with it. The less important a value is - the lower it will be on your hierarchy of values and the less discipline and more disorder you have associated with it.\\n\\nWhen you live according to your highest values you become inspired and awaken genius. When you live according to your lower values you require continuous outside motivation and you suppress your genius. Your present purpose or mission for life will reflect your present highest values.\\n\\nDetermining your values is practically useful in your daily reality as what you perceive to be \\'missing\\' will become what seems to be \\'important\\'. So this is why our private voids give rise to your public values.\" I feel like you were having a dig at mitsloveer boy #lol yes Jordan my soul is comfortable and it is most comfortable when I am sleeping hahaha I reckon you do an awesome job and I am glad you don\\'t take the attacks on you seriously. But hell man you must cop a lot more then all of us actually know Kirby has a really good take on time management. Id love to see you guys converse xD Im like 10% work rest is 90% procrastination It all started with the bachelor, now I’ve changed my life trajectory 🙌🏻😂 Wholesome I have the most trouble thinking of a single thing I want to strive towards, any goal. I cannot think of myself in a life that I\\'m at peace with. I felt the same, and was in an existential pit for years. What helped me was learning about things I found interesting. That lead to enrolling at uni to study something related. I have swapped degrees four times since then, but I have found several things which I would be happy to spend my life doing. I got to 7 min on the second time I have come to this channel. I can\\'t take anymore. But you get a like for the Liberal Government quote. Jordan, did you have too much red cordial today? bruz? 52+ hours at work, 40+ hours sleeping, and I love my children and wonderful partner. They get half of what’s left for them. The rest is cool down or wind up. I wish Sir. Jordan Shanks left heart reactions on more of his viewers comments Today I was trying to light a cigarette I found wedged in the pavement with a barbeque lighter in the rain, I did eventually get it lit but I think on it now and question the merit of that activity. I\\'ve been stressed out and scattered but I realise now, I\\'ve been diverting my focus to the wrong things. I should be studying or at least trying to, 25 days left till exams. I\\'ve been preoocupied worrying about getting a job, what my friends are doing, making movies, listening to music, smoking. As you said chase peace, and I will. Because I may be comfortable but I\\'m not at peace. Pointless activites are not going to get me that 9 out of 10 life. Thanks Jordies \\n\\nQuestion/Topic suggestion: Can mininalism help at all? Actually Jordan I think what this has revealed to me at least is a huge difference between how Labor and Liberal operate the Public Sector. \\n\\nI mean, in WA at least we\\'ve actually got hard targets to hit and we need to actively work towards improving outcomes for our community. Our union\\'s also worked their arses off to secure full-time permanency, and not only that it\\'s really serious on knowledge capture and proper decision making. \\n\\nmeanwhile, from what you\\'ve told us about the NSW Public sector under the Liberals it appears to be nothing more than a rubberstamping pack of yes-men. \\n\\nGeez, it\\'s little wonder so many PS workers lean towards Labor. Not only do they have good policy, they actually fucking listen to their agencies. That\\'s basically why the ACT has been a Labor stronghold both federally and territory wise. Shows how effective a beurocratic is......40% input and you\\'re the bees knees.......\\nAll the others only put in 20% then!!!!! Let\\'s not mention council workers????🤣🤣 I generally like what you\\'ve got to say. As someone who has worked in music for 30+ years, I don\\'t think you understand the music industry. I would suggest your friend become a consultant. Unless they\\'re happy to be broke. You know, poor but happy as opposed to rich and miserable. It\\'s a choice, but if you already have kids and a mortgage ...\\n\\n[edit]Also worth mentioning that if things get normal again then music also means spending your time travelling and playing, that\\'s where the $$ are. So no holidays, and little time at home ... You\\'d enjoy it, Jordan, but would your friend?[/edit] let me get my adhd diagnosis first bruz, then I want to try to be the New Zealand you, but ya know THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. I\\'d have my own spin, but we\\'re both kinda autists. It’s The Australian Tony Robbins with a whiny voice haha good stuff! Question: Can you compile all of your homework tasks into a single video? Pretty please?\\nCondense that self-help knowledge yo, help a brother out G. All sounds great except.. I would love to hear your internal dialog when it comes to Julian Assange. Seriously bumming me out that you won\\'t even mention the guy. Career before ethics? I thought you would be the last person to do it but everyone sells out it seems 😔 He has a video on Julian Assange on this channel. It\\'s probably what you\\'re looking for! This is one of the more serious videos you have done. You need to be a bit more harsh when it comes to how someone\\'s behaviour could impact their life. As in what they focus on and put their energy into. What energy you put into something is the energy you will receive, etc. You highlight these but would appreciate a more tough love approach because sometimes it is necessary. Liked the video, though - good work. this sucks. i couldnt get past five minutes of this inane quasi-motivational bs @Teish C who died and made you king, suck it I like that you still felt obligated to write a comment. Next time, don\\'t. Just leave. Soooo can we be a consultant for Jordie\\'s Friendly Consultants? Jordies Peterson. Been thinking about this a lot lately. Although I have been spending a lot of time putting energy into my pursuit and still haven\\'t seen anything from it, which gets disheartening. Think I\\'m just a bit in my head coz of isolation madness, and will keep pursuing... You and Struthless have both said similar things recently - Very much resonating! this is one of ur most profound videos. great work. u just keep getting better. keep going u r changing the world. what is the name of this musician/what\\'s his musical outlet called? I wanna follow his journey from this point onwards WHERE FOCUS GOES, ENERGY FLOWS! Jordan, when pursuing a big goal that requires lots of little skills to make it work (tech entrepreneurship for example) is it better to become average in lots of skills like marketing, sales, whatever else,  or focus more on leadership skills and get people more proficient to do the work for you.\\n\\nLove the vids stud I do NOT come here to have my life analysed friendlyjordies NOW DO THE FUNNY YILMAZ THING. this was an awesome vid, very wise thank you (-: always love these videos. hope you\\'re doing well man ❤️ Thanks, Jordan. Good topic. These kinds of vids help keep me on the path. Thank you so much for this I find it impossible to sustain goal-directed behavior for any significant period of time AJR wheel of life , should be done yearly with your tax return 💪👌👍 Solid video jords. I think I know what I need to do to better my career. \\n\\nI need to git gud at educatin\\' and shit. Bang on Jordan. 99% of the subjects/topics you discuss are also discussed in Jordan Petsons “12 rules of life an antidote to chaos”  coincidence I think not 20% Watching friendly 20% waiting for new friendly to upload a new video and 20% smoking billys and 40% trying to remember what i was doing again .... hi mark I thought that it was compulsory when watching Friendly Jordies 😉🤣 jk 7 years strong on Youtube 😀 What if I hit my Ultimate goal a few years ago and don\\'t have a family..ewww. and just like doing my own thing? I really liked that :) Dude that was really intense, can a life really only be in service to one goal ? Man.... You keep tell me this this stuff that I already knew but never internalised and its begining to piss me off how consistantly its happening. 0:19 I stopped my 9-5 thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m* I\\'ve got friends....they just don\\'t know me and there might or might not be a subscription service between us 18:50 what happened recently that caused so much regret? Thanks, man! I appreciate your wisdom and bravery Hi Jordan, was so delighted to hear you have friend. I too have a friend. I read in a rolling stone article that you lived in Korea. This isn\\'t a question, this is more of a OMG STORY TIME PLS request. Thank you. How was Korea? I live there now. Also, I am living an 8/10 life. I feel 10/10 some days but I gave myself an 8 to seem like less of a sociopath #behumble. THANKS BYE He has a good conscience,  Labour voter- Jordan Shanks 2020 Well, he\\'s not wrong. Ask most public sector workers and they\\'ll tell you that Labor actually operates the Public sector as a proper regulator as opposed to just a rubber-stamp mill. You got a friend in me jordan 4:32 _freezeframe_ Took Jordan 6 minutes to pretty much explain why people become million/billionaires.\\nThey’re workaholics who spend almost 100% of their time working.....\\n\\nAnd there are people who blame them for this hard work and want to take that away. Explain why SOME people become rich**\\nI don\\'t think anyone with half a brain has ever felt like money should be taken away from someone who has worked hard their whole life. I think people despise the rich who got there by means of exploiting other living things/earths resources, or the rich who got there by means of inheritance, and act as though they have earned it. I\\'m a consultant working for the fed gov. Thanks liberal guvnent for the job 0:37 I stopped my 9-5 because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m* Finally a \"LIBERAL GOVERNMENT\" again We need more people like Jordan 50% selling computer parts (i\\'m a computer sort of guy, so there is some passion in it), 10% exercise, read, meditate, et cetera, 5% guitar (something i also want to do more of), 25% youtube/netflix/random bullshit, 10% making computers to sell, talking to friends, et cetera. that\\'s how it be.

       " 'An unbiased reporting. \\nWell done. Chinavirus won this debate. @Smokey63 well it would be hard for Joe Biden for roll back the tax cuts. He may face massive opposition as it was almost unanimous. Whether he brings the super wealthy tax where the ultra rich pay a percentage on their income in taxes remains to be seen. With the news about President Trump\\'s taxes its a shot in arm for him. And he can definitely push at it. \\nAs far as US China trade war is concerned its not something which is going to end soon. The high US dependence on China is something that is always going to come back.  President Trump has spoken a lot but he has not really achieved anything worthwhile. The next round of debates will be crucial. There President Trump has an advantage. \\nAs far size of government spending is concerned that is really going to be the deciding factor. Democrats have heavily favored increase welfare in form social security and Medicare in the run up. If Joe Biden has to win he has clearly speak where he stands. And Donald Trump too has to speak on it. Though there has been 2 stimulus checks so he has covered some ground there. @wrecker The economy is in shambles at the moment, so trying to find \"good\" things would look really out of place. Mentioning the debt and nothing else is kind of a mercy tbh NCZIOOX criticizing without pointing out the good things is biased. @Smokey63 Is criticizing aspects of the current administration actually bias.. or just what\\'s been going on since the beginning of time? Wow I completely forgot that these candidates have policy platforms and issues. they dont, only one has a plan, the other just has goals that he maybe can get to after he plays some golf, daily twitter meltdowns, watching fox news for briefings, fear mongering and profiting off other foreign govts, and finally lying. he doesn\\'t have time for the American ppl. Maybe that is because they seem to have forgotten that too PLEASE READ. I think similar to the last presidential election there is foreign intrusion using China meme/thought. This time it is anger against China for COVID-19 and the lockdowns. These two variables favor Trump. Trump is seen as more anti-China, and the lockdowns are blamed more so against the Democrats versus the Republicans. PLEASE BE WARY. Last time around we know China was used for economic hardship via manufacturing job losses, etc. Join the event : https://www.facebook.com/events/3426946023994554/?active_tab=about I thought it was a circus. I would’ve paid good money to have both candidates on coke and Kanye West be the moderator. Then they\\'ll be debating over whose wife has the biggest booty. Mr. Trump is walking on the right path for his people. Mass Media has tried to bias Mr. Trump\\'s good policy to the USA before his presidency. This seams like a Biden ad. Democrats always rase tax on even small guys and it was Trump who lowered tax on poor and fixed the economy. It can\\'t be said he fixed the economy, it had been growing since the crisis of \\'08. Similar to what I thought. Except that I don’t know how he can expect Americans to pay more taxes while keeping the country shut down, especially with unemployment currently. Uh not really Nothing is funnier and enjoyable than a US election. I can’t wait to watch!!! LOL lol yes too entertaining , its like a reality TV show 😂 Ace haha us is a big joke 😂😂😂 Exactly Biden V.S Trump!

Napoleon was an idiot just like you🤔 @Christian Herrera great!, bot has more subscribers than us 👻👻🦅 William S it’s probably a comment bot meant to promote the channel. This was a good attempt at objective journalism. You can still kinda see the bias but at least they’re trying. Ahmad Mohammed Yeah the thing is you can’t really make journalists be objective. WSJ probably has journalists that are on the right and left and their bias comes through in their articles. This video seems like a step in the right direction tho. The funny thing is allsides did a poll and all the liberal says they lean right and conservatives said they lean left. I\\'d consider wsj pretty close to the center. Aditya Pande That’s what I’m saying, they’ve written some blatantly biased articles but this video is very objective compared to some of their other stuff. @jack willis I don\\'t think its biased man @jack willis LOL WSJ leans to the right As the economic crisis keeps rising, one\\nneeds to have different streams of income.One needs to have a diversified portfolio for survival I do hope expert Jackson can help me Who else observed his trading week was massive 😱 Really ya\\'ll know him,I even thought I\\'m the only one he has helped walk through the fear and falls of trade He\\'s no joke when it comes to technical analysis Wow,am very happy to meet a real broker like her,cant wait my friends are already making good profits Bidens Climate change is when you pay for other countries climate change program. Nobody likes bad environment but losing jobs for it is worse. “Politicians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason.”\\n― Mark Twain Aidan Cusack if you take the context of the original comment, Biden is the diaper that must be changed. 47 years in politics, time for someone new. Biden has been in Washington DC for 47 years. There is no question on who stinks the most between the two. How did Biden, his son, his brothers, his sister become multi millionaires? Government contracts awarded them courtesy of Joe. He is nothing but a poser. Life under his leadership was a disaster. He is such a door to door smarmy salesman. He is disgusting.

The thing is if you do tax cuts, then you\\'re supposed to ease up on spending. Trump has done the opposite. @The Rock economy is constricted by demand. Not financing. The opposite is true. \\n\\nTax cuts is a thinking of people who live in the 19th century and do not want to admit the immigrant fueled policy of low wages is a mistake.\\n\\nIf you want to do tax cuts on people then I guess, but not on business, especially not big business. They have more then enough money. @Vlad the guru That\\'s just simple Laffer curve, read into it. @The Rock never talk politics again. Your understanding of it is pathetically low. That\\'s what Republicans do. Bush cut taxes while starting two wars. @The Rock if the tax cuts where properly applied in the right area of the economy the best way to beat the bully is to laugh at him -   every smart person Notice this piece doesn\\'t note Biden\\'s support of Green New Deal. But Biden doesn\\'t support the Green New Deal... Sleepy joe. Four more years !! Unless you are one of the swing states, your vote kind of means nothing... Not really, everything is correlated. If swing states swing to Biden then states like CA will become even more liberal as well. A blowout is different than a narrow win! //Mr. Trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax, created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions, including business losses, to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities.\\n\\nMr. Trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of $24.3 million, excluding refunds he received after filing. For 2015, he paid $641,931, his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010.\\n\\nAs he settled into the Oval Office, his tax bills soon returned to form. His potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included $24.8 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and $56.4 million for the loans he did not repay. The dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability.\\n\\nEach time, he requested an extension to file his 1040; and each time, he made the required payment to the I.R.S. for income taxes he might owe — $1 million for 2016 and $4.2 million for 2017. But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.\\n\\nTo cancel out the tax bills, Mr. Trump made use of $9.7 million in business investment credits, at least some of which related to his renovation of the Old Post Office hotel, which qualified for a historic-preservation tax break. Although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all, his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017.\\n\\nWhen they got to line 56, the one for income taxes due, the amount was the same each year: $750.//\\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html I see Biden addressing the progressive wing of the party, by taking their suggestions into consideration as part of the democratic plank. I think Biden will accept the same points from the progressives that he pretty much agrees with, obviously. Not so much on altering Biden\\'s green energy plan, or other plans. But in cracking down on corporate abuses, plus advancing civil rights and consumer protection, etc. No @1:11 Biden wants to reduce tax rates for the richest one percent by a wooping 17%.  NEWS FLASH!!  The richest DON\\'T PAY ANY TAXES AT ALL!!!  If you raise their taxes, then they will leave the country.\\n\\nThe problem is neither party cares about the middle class.

Thanks for the thoughtful content yah he need to pay taxes like everybody else @jcgw2 Well, since they\\'re referring to has tax issues over the past 20 years, which he filed his tax returns under tax laws made and enforced under his predecessors, I guess he didn\\'t make those rules.🤣 @alvincyt not if one those players is writing the rules. then you can hate the player. If you think the game rules are poorly designed, blame the game, don\\'t blame the players who know the rules better than you. Literally no millionaire or billionaire pays their fair share //Mr. Trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax, created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions, including business losses, to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities.\\n\\nMr. Trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of $24.3 million, excluding refunds he received after filing. For 2015, he paid $641,931, his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010.\\n\\nAs he settled into the Oval Office, his tax bills soon returned to form. His potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included $24.8 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and $56.4 million for the loans he did not repay. The dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability.\\n\\nEach time, he requested an extension to file his 1040; and each time, he made the required payment to the I.R.S. for income taxes he might owe — $1 million for 2016 and $4.2 million for 2017. But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.\\n\\nTo cancel out the tax bills, Mr. Trump made use of $9.7 million in business investment credits, at least some of which related to his renovation of the Old Post Office hotel, which qualified for a historic-preservation tax break. Although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all, his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017.\\n\\nWhen they got to line 56, the one for income taxes due, the amount was the same each year: $750.//\\n\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html 7:09 What\\'s that? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGT_cQXpj8 https://youtu.be/xaW6V99_q-w I\\'m so excited about these elections I can\\'t wait for the debate tomorrow.\\nIt\\'s honestly going to be more entertaining than any playoff game. 🤣 2:53 “CHINA” The United States is finding out the hard way what Atlantic City went through when Trump came to town.... @Michael Schaefer your still gonna get blamed if you make a problem worse.

I think similar to the last presidential election there is foreign intrusion using China meme/thought. This time it is anger against China for COVID-19 and the lockdowns. These two variables favor Trump. Trump is seen as more anti-China, and the lockdowns are blamed more so against the Democrats versus the Republicans. PLEASE BE WARY.

Too much staff turnover under Trump administration is not a good sign but lacking of leadership 🤔 We really need to tackle debt, it\\'s getting out of hand. Richard Roberts Obama got us put of an recession, and fixed our economy, its not cheap and at the same time set up the economy for Trump in which he destroyed. @For The Last Time are you done sucking off trump your attempt to seem neutral is a joke. Increasing renewable energy and promoting nuclear energy would also make us independent without  destroying the earth. If you count spending on the military as productive you need to stop talking politics. @Vlad the guru I didn\\'t say Reagan was a good president. I said that rate of production hasn\\'t been this high since the Reagan administration. Jesus. In case you\\'ve followed his work, that, toppled with military spending, has literally been Trump\\'s sole focus. He\\'s increased funding for both agriculture and energy independence (which in turn sprouts infrastructure) all in the name of growing the economy. All of this has been done at expense of environmental protection, education, drug control, etc. Trump has done nothing but grow the economy and create jobs these last four years. He doesn\\'t care about anything else than that. I don\\'t care if you like him or not (because I certainly don\\'t), but there\\'s no denying he\\'s done very much for the economy, regardless if he cut taxes for the rich or not @For The Last Time its not my job to assist in your delusion.  Reagan was a terrible President who had to undue his own tax cuts. Trump has increased literally nothing. Tax cuts do not help when that money is not reinvested in the middle class. @Vlad the guru Besides, Trump did exactly that. Rate of production probably hasn\\'t been this high the Reagan administration. I don\\'t know what exactly you\\'re trying to prove. \\n\\nI\\'d also like to note I am in no way a Trump supporter, but with these little belittling comments of yours, you\\'re kinda shooting yourself in the foot Whoever wins... please do something about the increasing debt!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @Stephen Rayner I ain\\'t a Brit.... adhi shakthi The Chinese communist party did this!

While I dislike Trump, it\\'s not surprising that his taxes are low. He was a real-estate investor. No real-estate investor worth their salt pays much if any income tax - it\\'s been designed that way since the 50s to encourage investment in buildings/infastructure, as it\\'s seen to help build the country.\\n\\nIs that a good policy to have? Maybe not. But he\\'d be an idiot if he didn\\'t take advantage of tax deductions from depreciation etc. Read the article. Not just the headline. It makes you look dumb. @Pietro Saleri Really, as my opinion Italy\\'s punishment for Tax escape is so high. LAMO Like everyone else, the President minimized his tax burden. That’s the smart thing to do. Okay trump cuts taxes but he\\'s blown a hole in the budget.\\nHow is he planning to decrease the deficit? @Derek V Yes he has !  Simple blame China that is easy way out ! I bet you will hear CHINA,  CHINA more of that when he can not answer. It sorta works itself out. Better economy = more spending = \"more\" taxes.

No one has a plan He has no plan I\\'m here to read out all the random quotes  that comment section guys are quoting said by famous personalities😌 Yep. Average people using intellectuals quotes to try to sound smarter Yup Simply take a look at the federal deficits over the past 5 years for a frightening indicator of where this economy really stands and is heading under Trump\\'s administration. I wonder how we got in this predicament? Trump stiffed his creditors by $287 million since 2010. I\\'m quite impressed with how this channel tries to remain unbiased and focus on facts. At least it seems that way to me. Gloria https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wall-street-journal/?amp=1 @Gloria no Wsj has been biased toward democrats Wall street journal is worth to watch 😜 I agree, it genuinely seems to be neutral, or attempt to be so. Biden will harm the American economy. end regressive taxes @TheMrDamp It would increase their burden relative to now by making everyone pay the same percentage, which is ultimately the fairest system, though admittedly the current progressive tax system is initially at least more beneficial for most people @thonks that\\'s hilarious. You obviously do not understand how marginal tax rates work. A flat tax would mean the low and middle classes pay MORE in taxes. It increases their tax burden. You must be a billionaire. @thonks are both of you okay? Aurobindo Ghosh income tax should be flat 1 Thessalonians 4:16\\n“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first Widely accepted that Biden is better for economic growth than tax and draft dodger Trump- economy was doing well under Trump. Dems are not good for businesses. Bone spurs Biden’s platform honestly doesn’t make sense. How can you promote more taxes from citizens amidst a pandemic, while keeping the country shutdown? Not saying he’s a bad candidate but his answers really conflicted with each other. I didn\\'t watch this video because when I realised WSJ along with Washington Post, CNN, NYT etc.... are extreme leftards you can already guess what they are going to say before watching, listening or reading them. They are fast destroying America and the World. Why are half of the Americans still supporting them? I have no clue. Trump paid $750 in U.S taxes while paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to foreign countries in taxes.   If Biden did this, Republicans wouldn\\'t be okay with it.  Stop having selective morals and standards.  If they\\'re both bad, they both need to be dropped.  We need to clear the board. It\\'s called a LIE!! NO billionaire pays only $750. Having worked on taxes and people that do or did, know that\\'s a made up lie!! It came out saying such BUT they say no proof using the excuse that they are protecting their source. Because they KNOW it is a out for them. That no one can force there hand. How do you think news media make up these lies? WSJ is a biased anti trump broadcast. Great, unbiased informational reporting. Thank you usually when you rise the taxes on the rich, the rich take their business elsewhere and Trump knows that...I\\'m by no means rich but the poor don\\'t do anything for the country, the rich do. it is not fair lol I PREFER TRUMP 2020 Is printing money the same as borrowing it? there is no money , only debt . ( slavery ) Extra stimulus does not require the physical printing of money, rather it\\'s electronic. The Treasury sells bonds, and the Federal Reserve can purchase some of those bonds with \"printed\" money by crediting the Treasury\\'s account. Therefore, it\\'s borrowed money and not printed out of thin air. Trump 2020 🇺🇸 You told us much about trump economic policies here which we are experiencing already ,but didn\\'t here much of Mr Biden alternative to the ruin that trump is frying us in. . Paying taxes is the most basic obligation of American citizens. Trump can not do his duty. If he wins re-election, he will be the biggest disaster in the world. No-tax and spend, or tax and spend. Very simple choice, if the goals are responsibility, sustainability and proactivity. Trumps tax cuts only favored the ceos i a retieed veteran like so many america \"I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up & reach in the pool & rub my leg down so it was straight & watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap\" \"When I enter the Senate 180 years ago...\" Dammit, Joe. I told you to stop sniffing that glue!! @Angelo Dumapit is charisma an English word? It\\'s shameful not funny he doesn\\'t have \"charisma \" poor sleepy Joe!!  Trump/Pence 2020!!! like your unbiased reporting. *Poor Trump needs a troll army of paid teenagers because nobody else defends him* Eastern Lighthouse I would have thought they counted more than 50% so I guess that’s good. New York did not purposely target their elder population though... Trump takes office for 4 years and now everybody is some conspiracy theorist. I suppose he thrives off misinformation though. New York did not try to kill their elderly that doesn’t even make sense. New York is overwhelmingly liberal so those votes wouldn’t even matter. I’m sure the elderly there are still mostly liberal it’s that far left. Bobo it’s mostly elderly. Probably the main reason NY killed off a majority of them. They count for nearly 50% of COVID deaths isn’t that crazy? @Bobo teenagers get paid by Trump to troll the internet\\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/turning-point-teens-disinformation-trump/2020/09/15/c84091ae-f20a-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html Really???  Did you see a trump rally and Biden\\'s???  And you said nobody depends pres Trump?  Oh come on man you fool!!! Sebastian K teenagers do not support him... uneducated people support him. Literally The fed chair indicated last year that trillion dollar + deficits each year are not sustainable. The US has been tackling the problem on how to restructure its economy for decades.. Trump even wants to get rid of the payroll tax that funds Social SEcurity- He wants SS and Medicare to be funded from general revenue. He is NOT proposing eliminating either one...he is trying to give workers a \\'tax\\' break. MSM only reports half the story...up to you to research the rest. Never colonized america but they charged tax to america on 5th of September 1795. This aggrement was in Turkish language which is first agreement in foreign language which signed by america in history and signed in Algeria(Ottoman City in that time). America paid $21.600 (date:1795)  in every year. Also america paid $642.500 (date:1795) to save their prisoners in Ottoman city called Algeria.\\n\\nApproximately 20 years after its establishment, the USA paid taxes to the Ottoman Empire for 29 years by signing an agreement with Algeria, an Ottoman province, to make more comfortable sea trade.\\nSeptember 5 is the day the United States, which is shown as a super power, once paid taxes to the Ottoman Empire. We also touched upon this subject, which has always been a matter of curiosity.\\n\\nThe United States of America (USA) gained its independence in 1776 after victory in the war of independence with England. The USA, which was established as a new state in a geography far from trade and sea routes, had to use the sea routes to open up to the world.\\n\\nThe new fledgling country USA, which opened its inter-continental sails with its establishment, started to operate with its ships in the Mediterranean, although there was no agreement. At that time, Tunisia, Algeria and Tripoli were in our lands in Africa.\\n\\nAlgerian pirates seized and plundered US ships and captured sailors. The Americans wanted to be protected against these attacks on the ships, but they needed help from the Ottomans, one of the strongest countries in the region.\\n\\nAn American delegation came to the country to meet with \"Uncle\" in Algeria, an Ottoman province. On September 5, 1795, Algerian Uncle Hasan Pasha signed a 22-point \"Friendship and Peace Agreement\", all in Turkish.\\n\\nAccording to the agreement, America would pay 642,500 dollars for the prisoners in Algeria and would pay 21,600 dollars tax each year. Thus, America became the \"taxpayer\" of the Ottoman Empire. Biden just jelous of Billionaire Trump. Biden would like to be Billionaire like Trump before he hit 80 years old. All Biden campaign is copy from Trump. Biden follow Mr. Trump. Ha....ha...😀😁😂🤣😃😄😅 Bro 😂 have you seen his taxes for the last 10 years his business been losing money for 10 years straight and his almost half a billion dollars in debt trump is a fake billionaire. & dont forget the time where he lied on the forbes richest people saying he was a billionaire at that time when he was only worth about a couple million JOE BIDEN IS UNFIT\\nJOE BIDEN IS VERRY VERRY VERRY OLD Biden isn\\'t even much older than Trump. But I do agree, they are way too old and unfit to hold the presidency. TELEVISIBLE they are both too old. i don’t love biden. at least he can walk and ride a bike 😉 @lemon boy please don\\'t lie , it is ugly , hate trump as you may , biden is obvious senile 3 years older and he can still ride a bike 😂 with 27 trillion dollar national debt, somebody have to pay. It is nonsenses to have tax cut and defer Social Security tax, that would bankrupt the system all together. who is trump fooling. @rascally rabbit or 41% are fools. Trump fools 41% @elevengiant other countries is not US business. US debt is not other countries\\' debt. @dragondescendant1 every country is increasing the debt, so it cancels out @Marush Denchev are you kidding, the way it is going, national debt will be greater than the GDP.. You can kiss every public service, highway, school system........... goodbye. What a lot of people don\\'t get is if you raise taxes on companies they well leave... and what people also, don\\'t realize is that if we stop them...well they don\\'t...or more accurately they can\\'t. It\\'s called being a global superpower. Ever heard of that? Go Trump Pot says kettle black. “trumps good when it comes to the economy” ',\n",
       " 'AYYY thanks for the shoutout! @MINI Hit me up on the Discord. @The Pilot if you think that\\'s crazy im working on something new :) No worries. Respect for the epic build. :-) If only looks could kill was a glorious line... PayrollTips but Heat can ! :D @The Pilot ya, excellent writing for this video Thanks. :-) The Mamba is clearly inspired and based on the more than one and half thousand years ago Lamborghini Countach, for his owner is indifferent how useful it is, the only things that matters are style and coolness, in both of those she takes the highest score; his owner doesn\\'t want to do the awful thing called work he wants only to reach the next party in whatever space station it is  with style to reach his beloved spirits and cocaine. cocaine? you mean onionhead I mean not far off, especially given how Lambo\\'s need to be coaxed into turning well and you kinda gotta tame em more than drive em. I\\'m thinking that the dev\\'s at Frontier are Douglas Adams fans, and had the following quote from The Restaurant at the End of the Universe in mind when they designed this ship: \"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel nebula. I was going flat out, and this thing just strolled past, stardrive hardly ticking over. Just incredible.\" Zaphod whistled appreciatively. \"Ten seconds later, it smashed straight into the third moon of Jaglan Beta.\" \"Yeah, right?\" \"Amazing looking ship, though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow.\" @Niels Albers see, you get it. I am always very annoyed when someone says \"eew but its not like the book at all\" It’s been years since I read the books but one of my favourite parts is when the guide describes the fastest spaceship in the universe. This ship is run on bad news because, as everyone knows, nothing travels faster. The only problem was that it became incredibly unpopular as whenever it turned up it only had bad news for everyone! Ha ha, Douglas Adams was a very funny guy! the books are great, but so too are the original BBC production, the film, not so great. But that\\'s maybe because I was a teenager when I saw and read the first offerings, and they were quite a departure from most fayre of the day. @Kay Aich The HHGTTG movie? You do realise that the continuity of that particular franchise is all over the place, what with the original radio-play\\'s, the books, the TV series and the movies all being deliberately twisted versions of each other, all mutually contradictory in many places? Enjoy each on their own merits, that\\'s my advice :-) Lol🤣🤣 I\\'ve got to read these books. They\\'ve been sitting on my shelf for over a decade. When I do read them, they are going to ruin one of my favorite movies. Maybe it will inspire me to get back into the grind. o7 The Mamba is a ship you put tons of work into because you saw it and immediately fell in love with how it looked. The little ship that could and should be better than it is. Mambaaaaaaa just killed a man Bohemian Rhapsody Put a railgun up to his head. Held my trigger, now he\\'s dead. Dammit guess I\\'m buying a Mamba now. Thanks Pilot. You\\'re the best ship salesman. @Quotenwagnerianer couldn\\'t have said it better @Jeff Mitchell Yepp, its 1:1 afaik. Tho I took the two large from Vulture. @Jeff Mitchell actually I don\\'t lol. There are tons of ships I\\'ve never tried that the lovely Pilot makes me want to try. I hear the complaining about them and then folks make it sound like I shouldn\\'t try one and then he makes it obvious I should and then bam I try it and turns out they are actually quite good. Like the Beluga, it\\'s nowhere near as bad as folks say it is. I wonder if you can just get your FDL and swap over all the parts, and try out the Mamba. Everyone has a revved up FDL right? :) I\\'m considering it as well. Not that I need it, or that it is particularly good. But it just looks so sexy. It\\'s one of those ships that you just want to have, because you want to have it. _Sees the thumbnail:_ Oooh  _Hears the music 4 seconds in:_ *YES*\\n\\n\\n_Edit after watching the video all the way through:_ But can you imagine if racing was a supported game type broken up by ship size? How awesome would that be? Frankly, for me, speed isn\\'t everything in the builds. I built ghost giraffe\\'s viper and I like it less than my own custom racing eagle because something that pulls super tight corners is more fun for me to fly than a straight dragster. @Ben York Could you imagine a zone like in CQC, and with small corridors that could shave time off your laps but require more agile/smaller ships to make it through? r/eliteracers is where races are organised. Great fun. Agreed, this game has the ships for it. It totally needs an official space race mode. It wouldn\\'t even just be Mambas. You would see lots of experimentation with vipers, cobras, eagles, couriers, etc and how each handles racing Note:    saying Fer de Lance is just as quick as saying F-D-L. @Lou Sensei ,I\\'m in New Zealand bro.probly not the same guy.sorry. @Steve Molloy ? Not now, mayby wen ya posted this Absolutely not the best ship fresh out of the box. Mamba takes some time & lovin\\'. Engineered, its got 2 big boy guns on it\\'s shoulders & a monster in the middle that you can put to work in the cz all day. It\\'s a pilot\\'s pilot ship for the stick & rudder men who just need a fighting chance & a shot of whiskey.\\nSolid video as always @Evil Merlin To each their own! Fly whatever works for you :) @Zachary Damascus Boring. @Evil Merlin A Frag Mamba is absolutely and objectively superior for jousting attacks; imo it\\'s basically what the Mamba was built to do. @Evil Merlin If you\\'re a one dimensional pilot that can\\'t change tactics to suit the ship, then yes.  In all other cases, not at all. The FdL is still quite superior. Honestly it\\'s one of those ships that performs in a very specific way, requiring you to learn it\\'s quirks well, and how to make it sing. But to do that you\\'ll have to learn fly in a way where you toggle your flight assist situationally and play with your thrusters well to coax it into do what you want it to. It\\'s a unique ship that is tempermental and hard to master, but really god damn rewarding.  I put PA\\'s on it because I hate the concept of sanity. I agree I love my Mamba and fly pretty much FA off all the time for anything I\\'m doing. The Mamba killed me a few times but once I understood, she is sooooooo much fun to fly. tarnokka plasma accelerators \"where you toggle your flight assist situationally and play with your thrusters well to coax it into do what you want it to\"\\n\\nElaborate!? How do you use the flight assist? What is a PA? *tries to retract the landing gear* - \"Do\\'h!\" @Darkner 77 Last time I checked, it\\'s still bugged Is the landing gear bug still in the game?!? You can park it under a star and fuel scoop- heat never goes about 62%. Means you can fit a class 2 scoop and travel longer range. Basically it\\'s a long range fighter like the P51 Mustang to the FDL\\'s Spitfire. Both had the same Merlin engine..... I\\'m sure most know that lateral/vertical thrust differs ship-to-ship, though unwritten.\\n\\nAnd many likely know that that  includes max thrust speed as well as thrust acceleration/deceleration. A ship may have higher max thrust, but takes longer to reach that speed than a ship with lower max thrust.\\n\\nBut......all  of those values are also affected by FA off/on.....not just forward and reverse. Pitch, yaw, roll, lateral, vertical, fore, and aft may differ in FA off.\\n\\nExploring these dynamics is never a waste of time, and can reveal a niche unfilled by any other craft.\\n\\nAnd sometimes you can just make your own niche. \\n\\nFly nasty you bastards! The Mamba corners like it\\'s on rails.\\n\\nUnfortunately they\\'re the ones running dead east-west across Oklahoma. The funny thing is that, actually, the hardpoints ARE different IF you\\'re using MCs, because the spinup time on a Class 3 is way too long, and the damage on a Class 1 is way too low.  Class 4 and Class 2 MCs are the best MCs by far because they strike a reasonable balance between damage and spinup (especially the Class 4 because it seems to be instant.)\\n\\nWith lasers, no difference, sure.  But with MCs the Mamba has one of those \"invisible on paper\" advantages that you still shouldn\\'t ignore.  That said, a properly build Krait, Python, or even Chieftain can easily kill one.  For a ship that\\'s supposed to be best of breed for combat, it just...isn\\'t.  It\\'s not bad, no way.  But when a multirole ship costing half as much can kick your ass and still jump 45ly, you\\'ve done something wrong. In my opinion the Mamba is not a dueling combat ship.  It\\'s doable but not ideal.  Where the Mamba really shines is in wing fights.  It is perfect for the Interceptor role. Large MCs have 50% more dps, which offsets slightly longer spool up time if you know how to fly and put your guns on target. Not to mention you can pre-spool them, again comes with some skill and experience. Also, class 1 hardpoints are great for utility use such as corrosive effect MC. Meaning you don\\'t sacrifice as much of your damage output for using it.\\n\\nMamba has plenty of dedicated pilots who love it and put it to great use. It has found it\\'s way into PVP, and is a fearsome opponent. Well said Agreed, such a waste of beautiful design, this ship...\\nAnyways, great video, as usual :D love your reviews. I can understand everything you say and everything you mean. which unfortunately I can\\'t do with other youtubers. and despite being very informational you do a very good job and making everything almost poetic. thank you for being my favorite ED youtuber.

I really like the Mamba for the looks and _ESPECIALLY_ for it\\'s Non-OCD-Inducing Cockpit.\\nWhich is the one thing that I hate about the Fer-De-Lance.... so much, that I can\\'t love it - decpite being the (arguably) best (medium) combatship in Elite.\\n\\n\\n3x Plasma Accelerators (Efficient/Plasma-Slugs), 2 xmall turreted thermal vent beams (which I consider switching for MC\\'s) , a lot of Guardian Shieled Boossters and some extra tanks is how I have equiped my Mamba.\\nHeavily enginered of cause.\\n\\n\\nIt is a blast to hunt down ships in between the asteroids of a HazREZ.\\n\\n\\nIt is not a highly effective bounty hunting  ship (compared to other combat ships), but it is FUN.\\nProvided you are descent at flying  FA/off.\\n(Which you should practice while mining for void opals... this is a good and fun opportunity to learn FA/off - just saying.) Putting Plasma Slugs on a Zorgon Peterson ship is just asking for it to self destruct from an empty tank I just can\\'t get a hang of flying faoff, I just overcompensate or undercompensate or wind up barreling about like I just hit a jetstream.\\n\\nCorrection: I fly better in a jet cone than faoff You forgot to mention the ungodly scream of the engines. They want you to boost ... constantly. I love them, it\\'s their their sound, their presence, their POWA. Yeah I keep 4 pips on engines as much as I possibly can.\\n\\nBecause reasons. How to pop mach 3 in one direction flip around and go mach 3 in the other I want to love the ship so bad, the small hardpoints, terrible turning and terrible convergence all combine to just make it not quite good enough. Let the haters hate. I will fly the unfriendly skies in my golden mamba. I consider this video a \"Hey! Buy me when you have everything else.\" I consider your comment accurate. I do mostly fly it for its looks. It\\'s heavily engineered and I have to accept its flaws. I\\'d like it to be as exceptional as it looks, but to me it\\'s worth it not to have a metal pole in front of my face. :D There is one place in combat that it does shine. Aside from simple beauty. If you have a wing doing combat zones and one of your pilots has a mamba built for speed and range it\\'s fairly easy to chase off opposing commanders once the group gets them to start running. I really wanted to love mine, and the theoretical does is great, but in a fight that is not one sided it can\\'t keep the guns on target well enough to put that down to use. Can you kill stuff? Sure, but how much time do you have to waste on each target while a similar equipped fdl is chewing through everything way faster simply by having the turning speed. Did they finally fix the non-retractable landing gear? Kinda sorta, fragga gankers dont seem to mind tho \"...if only looks could kill...\" XD\\nBwahahahaha!... Brilliant!! 5:10 is the start of one of the most badass moves i\\'ve ever seen in this game. Badass move of exploding and dying? \"If looks could kill.\" I want one just for the photo ops. The Mamba, Viper mk3, Imp Clipper & Courier, are all a good case for implementing a kind of either a death race and/or biathlon in space, game modes/features. It\\'s also notable that the Orca hold the same max speed. Orca is OG @Shuiya Marissa Dunno, Imp. Eagle is to the Eagle what the Mamba tries to be to the FDL. Faster in a straight line but turns worse, more theoretical firepower, but not the bigger distributor/powerplant to feed them. Don\\'t forget the Imp. Eagle! I think its a role play ship. I have (had) mine set up for exploring instances. repairing/refueling ships, scanning wakes and just looking like a badass when I show up. the courier is the real rp ship :) Excellent review. Really told me what I needed to know about this ship when considering it compared to others. =) Still my main ship, though I don’t have much problem with heat, one of my builds that features missiles, I have to really really try to get it to overheat. Really only one of my newer builds, that’s begging to overheat, and it still cools off fairly quickly. Granted I do have a thermal vent beam for that particular build. But still. just to fly it is fun... but it is only really good as a 3rd or 4th ship to have... But I still love mine. I look at this ship and see an American WW2 heavy fighter. Not in appearance, but in purpose. Approach fast, hit really hard for a short time, fly out of range before they can do anything about it. Put simply, boom ‘n’ zoom. Love this ship with a °°°° autocannon on the top. Thing is an animal. Use multi cannon\\'s on all the hardpoints except the two small hardpoints where gimballed beams will keep you ticking along, this solves overheating and power draw.\\nUse FA off lots then you have a lovely fast powerfull ship for Bounty Hunting, beauty is if you get into trouble you can outrun anything that can cause you trouble. Under the icy roar\\nof a sanguine Solo Wing,\\nour curtain drops to the floor,\\non Round Table’s ring.\\n\\nTo the rhythm of Agnus Dei,\\n“Yo buddy, still alive?”\\nA coward becomes an ace.\\n “We will survive.”\\n\\n\\nIs basically the Mamba when I go out in mine named \"Galm 2\" How are things at the border? Just wish it had a better jump range so I can use it as a exploration ship. It looks amazing. I looove these videos .. thanks!\\n\\nIf the FDL had a center seat in the cockpit, it\\'d be nigh perfect for a lot of things; but that and the paintjob make me want Mamba :O I fly mine FOR the looks ;) \\nAnd for her dominating growl as she fills the dock with thrusters. Well I love my mamba for bounty hunting, never been killed in it.  I\\'m only at grade 3 for engineering, and I ain\\'t found anything that can out turn or outrun me. New to the whole space sim world as a recent convert to the real amazement of the universe, but I just came across your channel this morning and I tell you it is one of the best. Can\\'t believe your first upload was 3 months ago. Is that true? Yep. :-) Just started playing Elite and just found your videos. I love the character of these ship reviews. I love these videos. It\\'s plain out Ship Porn! Great work as always Pilot, total respect from across the pond...... Hey, I got ganked by Feisty Goat the other day! lol Take away size 1\\'s\\nBuff agility to just below FDL\\'s\\n\"I fixed it, guys!\" @Evelyn Terry I got ganked by him, in Deciat, months ago; I rather think he just sits there while watchign netflix all day, waiting for people to go for their first engineering run ... green commanders get waxed by Goat :/ @Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit it was. Was it in deciat? Thank you!! was your top speed spec without engineering? my Mamba goes 580 (or 610 with lightweight armour) A little bit of both. Engineered drives, but not everything fully stripped and lightened. Great vid! Awesome I have something to watch! I\\'m going to make breakfast right now just to watch this properly. ahhhh my lovely Mamba :)\\ni made just a litte of engineering but it works just as intendet .... couldnt find a Huge Fragcanon so i just took a Huge Plasmaaccellerator xD....\\nmakes your anaconda rethink its turnrates and Hardpointpositions\\n\\n\\nfor the next video i would like to see the Fed. Corvette if you would like to :) Aw yeah, favorite combat ship! It\\'d be cool if it were better in general as a ship.\\nNone of the NPC\\'s in the hazrez can catch up. Oh my God I love your channel so much. The intro music was epic also☺️👍🇩🇰 Wonderful video man! Just bought my mamba last week, and now You\\'ve got me inspired to go use it! I just LOVE taking my Racing Mamba to some canyons just to race around, while looking out the beautiful giant canopy. Wonderful. Another fantastic ship review o7! Thanks for yet another thoughtful and considered ship review, I look forward to your videos every week - and I\\'d love to see more event collaborations if you can fit them into your schedule too, The Getaway Driver was great fun. Keep up the good work, hope to see you someday out in the black o7 Qualit of videos is always top notch. But the information and delivery is also amazing.\\n\\nAlways suprising and refreshing Great vid!  Think you might do the Diamondback Explorer soon? Mamba with the gold skin in VR is about the most gorgeous thing I\\'ve ever flown. I used it for some exploration for a while cause just looking at it made the trip worthwhile.\\nAlso: White thrusters, a purple HUD with white shields, and your favorite trinket on the dash compliments the gold so well. @Mr Smiley Sorry but my opinion is it sucks lol. Im just so triggered by the camera on a stick thing on the front of the ship. Its especially noticable when night vision is on. Yes the Mamba is lovely in VR. I did the entire DW2 trip in one. Mine is all white with blue engine trails. Love your vids and your style... Keep it up Another cracking video. My mamba runs all beams. Has boost of around 618mps. Has shields for days because while in permanent boost + turning she goes like shit off a stick.  Another great video. Glad you\\'re back. If I remember, fiestygoats had his cadre in decait for a while. As, I think I remember he was being hunted down by ghost legion. Boy was that a hell of a fight. I for one am absolutely in love with my Frag Mamba and believe the ship was designed from the ground up for a jousting role. Don\\'t try to fly it like an FDL! If you want to do that, just use an FDL. You need to play to the Mamba\\'s strengths for it to be effective. Another well executed video, lovel arty shots, descriptions etc!! Good effort Can you do the Imperial Cutter next... Love the vids!!! I literally got ganked by that exact mamba build when I was unlocking felicity a few days back. Good to know copycats exist i guess. Still pissed off by the instant interdiction when I entered the system. It was on ps4 even Well, looks are really the only reason one could ever prefer this ship to the FdL. The turn rate is worse than basically any other combat ship and quite a few multipurpose ones. Even the freaking federal gunship is rated better than this. Which, to be honest, is totally unrealistic and makes no sense to me. If someone knows how to build it and fly it, it holds up against almost every other ship fairly well odly enough there\\'s one other way it\\'s better than the FdL - the seat is in the middle of the cockpit. \\n\\n\\nbut that\\'s it really. Appreciate the Keelback Kameo. Keep up the good work\\n-Lakon Marketing Division, Keelback Office- Keep it on the DL, will ya? Nobody else has figured it out yet. ;-) I have 4 of these, I love them. What is that thing at the end!? I\\'ve played this game for thousands of hours and never seen anything like that! I thought at the beggining: Bruh, thats an FDL. Big love to your videos, you make some of the best ED vids in the Galaxy partner ;) Also, the Mamba looks amazing lol Ayy, you made it! ♥ These videos are very entertaining and i’de love to see one on the diamond back explorer heck yeah! great presentation! I saw this video and bought a mamba anyways... mainly for the appearance yes. On paper and in your imagination it makes a badass bounty hunter. I fly in combat with FA off and ive never had the turning issue everyone seems to complain about (it has the same maneuverability as the krait II) i bought this ship expecting bark but no bite. However im not disappointed. Its better than i thought... its just a very niche ship To be honest, Mamba before the nerfs was quite bad, but after the nerf and with a lot of engineering, the ship can actually hold against the FDL, providing that you don\\'t try to fly it like you would fly the FDL. If you put much effort into engineering honestly the mamba can be one hell of a shield tank, but it looses some of its speed in the process, honestly think it looks good, and is damn lethal, again if its engineered right. Great stuff, hoping that you can do the Krait Mk. II Im flying a frag mamba in Shinrarta Dezhra currently, and i can that this ship is not only beautiful. \\nFer de lance pilots fear me ! Still the same redundant ship it\\'s always been. This is \"content\" from fdev. Zorgon P has 2 $100,000 credit similar starter ships and then TWO identical $50 million credit medium combat ships. Why not a multipurpose? Why no large? Why waste development time on a Fer-de-lance-again? One question: How do you get such smooth camera angles? I tried multiple times messing with the camera and all i get is jarred movement. Please enlighten me master Don\\'t...don\\'t call me that. You need a thumbstick, like one on a controller to operate the camera. And steady hands. Mamba, cause its the year 3300 and you still have a mullet haircut. It’s a fragile speedster paired with a glass cannon. wow it feels like im watching a  Discovery Channel documentary Yep, it\\'s pretty. This intro music. I mean it: This intro music is what pretty much inspired me to give my Fer-de-Lance the shipkit I did. Because that music suits the Mamba - and I wanted it to fit my Fer-de-Lance too. To make it look like the nimble, shooty speed demon it is! :D\\nhttps://i.redd.it/n46240je6ae41.png <- This is what I ended up with! Krait MKII Next! Long over due Love the tune at the end what is it?! Can I interest you in the \"Beats and Blogs\" package? https://www.patreon.com/posts/28757273\\n\\nI post downloads to all the music I use each week. If you\\'re interested. :-) It\\'s pretty tho c: Are you paid by Frontier lol? \"The Mamba\\'s a deadly ship in the right hands, as an example, Here\\'s footage of a Ganker!\" Lulz. Gankers are a toxic, cancerous filth upon the community who probably spend 60% of their time Seal Clubbing inexperienced and Non-Combative pilots. I am a PvE primary in a VERY, Nicely outfitted and engineered Conda, and half the gankers to take a swing at me turn and run simply because I have the gumption to turn around and shoot back, not because I\\'m any good at it. You\\'ve used good examples before. You\\'ve used good examples since. But THIS, is not one of them. It\\'s good and PvE, but I have a friend who wastes NPC\\'s like it\\'s going out of style in a Keelly, and Yamiks killed a Thargoid in a Sidewinder. ANYTHING\\'s good and PvE as long as you beat your head against it long enough. You wanna impress me with PvP? Bring me an example of someone using it in a PvP League, or a genuine grudge match dog fight. Don\\'t show me a shot of a Fleeing, what I\\'m assuming was a Clipper, getting seal clubbed. Yea the heat is a PROBLEM. I’m running one of these with heat shock beamies and lemme tell y’all now it ain’t workin. Beautiful ship tho. Woah what happened to the VO audio quality? Reminds me of ships in wipeout Its the most beautiful ship in the game in my opinion. I traveled across the galaxy and completed the DW2 event in a Mamba. I also have a midnight black Mamba for combat. I\\'m no fighter pilot but even I can take out wings of Anaconda pirates with that ship. It just needs a special, finesse to fly it (try boost FA off turns).  Would I complain if it got a buff? Of course not, but it is far from being a bad ship. You learn it\\'s little secrets and it will look after you very well. In a way I am glad its not the best ship. It discourages the plebs and the non-believers from buying one, making it a unique ship for the more discerning taste. As for basking, this is the medium ship Gutamaya should have made. Just saying :)\\nOh and stuff you Yamiks, I want a spoiler for my mamba ;) @David Bracher I\\'ve got 39.19Ly for my Mamba, but mainly because I still wanted the speed of 509m/s cruise and 640m/s boost. However the max you can get from a Mamba is 43.15Ly if memory serves correctly. However that is without srv and totally stripped back What jump range can you get on it for exploration. God, I want to love the Mamba. Just wished Frontier had the balls to make it something radically different instead of just a slight sidegraded FDL. I want this thing to be the muscle car of space, even more so than the FDL Im new to elite, playing for 3 days now and when i saw this at a shipyard i wanted to buy it for the looks but i dont know if its worth it. Is it better now? Or do you still need to engineer it? It is a really good ship BUT you have to spend time learning it. You need to toggle flight assist on and off, you need to avoid the turn fights you wont win. Do not be afraid to break off turn out of the fight and slash back in. With all of the guns on the top, you are really well set up for the slashing attack, and you can bring A lot of pain down on your target. \\nIf I need to turn to hit a target, flight assist off, flip the nose around, then boost. Once you get good at the maneuver, you can turn around 180 on a dime. How about a review on the federal gunship? 520 boost? You should get it over 600 with engineering ',\n",

Michael Jackson is a musical genius while Travis Scott really isn’t that great Singer: Michael Jackson. Drums: Hal Blaine (Version). Synthesizer: Havenita.

All over again in Year 4 of the Meridian timeline, with Robert Gregory performing it instead.\\nAll of the dancers/gang members in the video owed me a debt of service. Never forget you Michael. He sold his parents now will u remember him? hope he sees this bro <3 Especially if you\\'re a kid This comment made me so emotional dude. Rip Michael, we love you and we’ll always remember you. Fly high king ❤️ agree AMAZING FACTS:\\n\\nAt Michael Jackson\\'s insistence, 81 of the actors were real gang members from rivals the Crips and Bloods, almost all of whom were convicted felons.\\n\\nAs art imitated real life, Jackson used the video to try to get the rival gangs to reconcile.\\n\\nJackson wrote the song to be a hard rock tune that could be enjoyed by young and old alike. \\n\\nJackson was forced to pay the $150,000 production costs himself because CBS refused to pay it, fearing the video would be a bomb and money loser. \\n\\nJermaine Jackson said that Michael\\'s inspiration for the song came from gang violence that he had witnessed as a child. \\n\\nThe video was filmed in Skid Row. Some of the production crew were hesitant to film there but Jackson convinced them that it was safe. \\n\\nWhen producer Quincy Jones first asked Eddie Van Halen to play a guitar solo on the song, Van Halen though that it was a prank call. \\n\\nDuring the recording, Van Halen\\'s ultra-fast guitar solo overwhelmed the JBL studio monitor speaker and thus caused it to catch fire, shocking the sound engineers. \\n\\nSteve Lukather, a founding member of Toto, was the lead guitarist. He is a legendary studio musician who has recorded on more than 1,500 studio albums. \\n\\nPaul Jackson, Jr. (no relation to Michael) played rhythm guitar. He was also a legendary studio musician who recorded on hundreds of albums by major artists such as Elton John, Al Jarreau, and Chicago. \\n\\nThe man dressed in white was Michael Peters, the video\\'s gay choreographer who died from AIDS in 1994. He was considered one of the world\\'s most talented dancers and choreographers. He also choreographed Jackson\\'s \"Thriller\" video.

Michael Jackson is forever. And ever. Recently, Akon said: \"All that (False Accusations) was propaganda because Mike was doing so much big things in the publishing world.\"\\n\\n\"I always felt like in the music side he was buying out a lot of great real estate. And he would not sell it back or would not offer no options for it to be sold\".\\n\\n\"Then of course his own catalog... there was a fight around that.\"\\n\\n\"What Michael was more about is power because he was super smart and understood what real value meant to America\".\\n\\n\"So he had access to a lot of American value, and he owned it. And if he did not own 100 per cent he owned it fifty per cent.\"\\n\\n\"And at some point they are gonna want to have the option to buy it back or control it to an extent, and Mike would not just allow it.\\n\\n\"And that is when a lot of propaganda and all these whispers started coming out about him, \\xa0that is clearly not true.\"\\nWe had some real conversations and I got to know his type\\xa0-\\xa0\\xa0he liked classy, slim, women - you know what I am saying?\"\\n\\nJackson\\'s estate handed over the rights to the Sony ATV catalogue for $750m in 2016. You damn right Who are you M 360 This is true af. Elvis, David Bowie and Steven Tyler actually did and there is proof. All they have on Michael is allegations that again, were never proven and there was no evidence. Michael gets attacked because he was an easy target. The guy was very naive and lots of people took advantage of him. I really like michael jackson dance he is very good from kpop Kpop they just imitate :( I\\'m pretty sure he is a *pop* singer..

Not because he was short of ideas but because he was finished, done, his body won\\'t give anymore, his time was up. Even in 2009 he was just a suffering, writhing shadow of his former self. I am thankful to God that he was relieved from further suffering. @Monila Ninetynine Can I like this twice? Michael Jackson, Forever Legendary King of Pop! 👑 #MJ 🎤  \\n\\nWho else agrees!

Me Oui Me, cause I’m a broke college student Lin before quarantine: *moves hands a lot*\\nLin during quarantine: *stares straight at the camera and motionless*\\nHe\\'s freaking awesome haha @Lyndee Northrop thanks xd I love hamilton too i loveeee your profile pic!!! XD I swear I was scared I LOVE how Lin got into character for the Zoom performance. Whether an audience of thousands or just one little girl, he put the show on didn’t he?!!! Yesss Lin is a national treasure. that is wholsome. change my mind if you can. So did Leslie! He\\'s freakin\\' brilliant. if i was on a zoom call with anthony ramos AND HE STARTED SINGING. \\n\\n\\n....\\n\\nᵐʸ ˢᵒᵘˡ ʷᵒᵘˡᵈ ˡᵉᵃᵛᵉ ᵐʸ ᵇᵒᵈʸ I don’t think I could function 😂 same tho same I LOVE HIM SO MUCH I LOVE LIN HIM AND JOHN THEY ARE MY TOP CELEB CRUSHES SO I WOULD LITTERALLY DIE i wouldve winked 😳😚 Nobody tell John when the quarantine is over so he\\'ll just keep doing these. pretty sure its been canceled Yeah but I feel like he\\'d find out SOME time Time for a conspiracy :) Lol @My Dearest, Angelica very nice username Everyone: 😀😃😀😃😀😃\\nLesley: ☝🏾👨🏾\\u200d🦱☝🏾 ✋🏾👨🏾\\u200d🦱🖐🏾 👨🏾\\u200d🦱\\n                                                 👐🏾\\nGirl:🤭🤭😯🤭🤭😯🤭🤭🤭\\nLin:👁👄👁🧔🏻 This comment made me laugh so hard for some reason Tru tru \"I\\'ve never really seen the office or whatever\" that kid just accidentally dropped the funniest line on a show created and written by John Krisinski. Kid, you\\'re goin\\' places. Max K I’m watching the office now it is a little inappropriate but it’s crazy funny \"No, but I love the memes\" Haaa HOW DID THEY GET THE TIMING ON ZOOM RIGHT IM SO CONFUSED 11:30 Is it just me or is that the popping of Skype and not zoom?!? Allison Menard oh then I would not like it as much No, they probably put on the camera off invisible name setting them just turned on their camera Everyone singing except Lin was pre-recorded. Then they edited it together before the call with the girl. Still pretty cool, though. If you look closely you can see that he is looking at his phone before lin joins How can over 3K people dislike this video!? I\\'m not religious, but y\\'all need Jesus. @nimn.atlantic Same! And happy for us that we get to watch it at least :) @JojoJoJo  in vain means to not say his name for an excuse of anything that you did (negatively) @Crazy Monkey what This comment is my life 😂 Amen! I just hope he doesn’t stop doing this even after everything\\'s normal. Kate Parkes honestly tho 6 months later.... Too bad he already did.  I wont call him a sellout but........  He sold the show to CBS Well it’s been two months 😅 ik! he is keeping me happy during this and i never want him to stop! Ok but like HOW is she just sitting there the whole time smiling and covering her mouth?! I would\\'ve been SMILING, CRYING AND SCREAMING right there on camera... I\\'d probably be singing along, I\\'m crazy bro i wouldve started singing with them fr same I would have been like 👁👄👁.          \\n                         Singing      🎤 🎶 I THOUGHT THE SAME THING. HAS SHE ALREADY MET LIN?!?!??!! Also Jonathan groff just there, also were Anthony and Jasmine in different rooms John: he’s like a backup dancer\\n\\nEntire Hamilton cast: are you sure about that?? \"I\\'ve never seen The Office or whatever\" I love that 😂 Ladies and gentleman I would like to announce that John Krasinski has officially won youtube agreed from india Agreed from Lancashire Agreed from Thailand from Spain Agreed from Corinth, NY like imagine one of the casts family members coming in and being like what are you doing then they’re like “SHUT UP IM DOING A MUSICAL” Their  mom: I KNOW BRODWAYS CLOSED BUT WE HAVE GUESTS OVER CAN U WAITTTT If someone surprised me with Anthony Ramos it would be the cause of my death \"...our meteorologist, Robert DeNiro...\" ARE YOU SERIOUS Was that not the BEST thing ever!!! That was hilarious. Reminded me of family guy John: here’s Mary poppies!\\nEveryone else: ITS MARY POPPINS!\\nme: ITS THE BAKERS WIFE!!! @Adam Sincock angel, of blasting tom cruise with that sig sauer 226 about a couple hundred times.  To reset him of course.  LoL I hope they make another one. 👍😁 Shannon G it’s Rachel from the girl on the train Me: it’s Emily from the devil wears Prada 🤣 Me: That\\'s Rita Vrataski ,The Angel of Verdun Oh to be a 9 year old girl being serenaded by the original cast of Hamilton I literally stared crying I would have KILLED for this chance ngl i’d honestly cry because i’m this one chinese kid that will literally never get out of asia who wants to watch hamilton but will never get the chance. i’m so jealous of a 9 year old .-. fr Oh the tears! I cried more with each cast member. How fantastic! It was beautiful I do hope that Aubrey has watched hamilton on Disney+ a ton of times already. GrandiaKnight I’ve watched it 8 times in 3 days I’m going insane GrandiaKnight I’m on 14 @GrandiaKnight Wow I have only seen it 4 i watched it a lot of times I am on my 6th watch...I have a problem... Am a big Hamilton fan and I cried like the surprise was mine. Awwwww. same skskksjs 😹 Same Same here. RIGHTTT right and i\\'m not even 9 no more Lin: *Intensely stares at his camera*\\nHamilton Cast:*Looks at their screen looking SO relaxed*\\nMe: What the-- LiN! Be MoRe ReLaXeD\\nAlso me: That girl is soooooo lucky!!! U-U john: whatd i miss\\n\\n\\nme: starts singing hamilton John Kraninki is the legend we didn\\'t know we needed Why do I feel like everyone is secretly going “that’s nice........for her.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOr maybe I’m just greedy idk sorry I feel you I can\\'t stop crying, the Hamilton surprise is the sweetest thing I\\'ve seen in ages. Same 😍 See, I would\\'ve screamed when Daveed Diggs came on the screen and it would\\'ve caught him off guard lol SAMEEE!! AND ANTHONY John Krasinski continues to prove how Essential he is. John Krasinski flexing hard on the entire YouTube community and this is just his second video 😂 Daniel Gibbons facts. @Gilmour11 he\\'s a youtube piper for us prisoners at home. not sure what other secrets are up his saucer. I wish this one is always here, and shines on. Daniel Gibbons damn bro I just finished watching it you made an understatement if anything that was crazy kool. It’s pronounced Kronicki My Like made 1k Likes!!!🤩👌🏽✌🏽 if i were aubrey, *i\\'d be sobbing the whole time* I would have been crying and falling off of my chair Right?  I was sobbing watching this!!  I need NO ONE to surprise me like this.  I would make a fool of myself with all the emotion. I wonder if he knows how many lives he\\'s saving. I just lost multiple pets and family members very dear to me very recently, and being able to watch all these episodes of John Krasinski just being an awesome human being and giving people hope, has made me feel better. Makes my days and probably helped save my life. Wow that’s amazing! Always remember you are amazing That little girl is adorable!!! She\\'s like \"Oh, I love Mary Poppins!\" \\n**sees Mary Poppins** \"Oh Wow! I like the movie and thought blah, blah, blah about the cinematography, etc.\"\\n**Lin-Manuel Miranda pops in**\\nLittle Girl at 10:41: 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😵😵😵😵😵😵😵 (she looked like Troy Barnes in Community when he met Lavar Burton, LMBO!! 🤣😂) My mom: trying to watch Hamilton with me\\n\\nMe: seeing Hamilton for the first time singing every song perfectly because I studied every song\\n\\nMy mom: 👁👄👁 john krasinski is a gem of a human being and the world doesn\\'t deserve him. @Brad F. Ha !! Loved it !! The world would be worst if John wasn\\'t here in this world he was born for a reason like now he has help alot of people smile. Through this uncertain time. God bless you John and your family. Thats just because we need more people like him. John Krasinski is incredible actor Erfaneh Mhm you’re right but we’ll keep ‘em anyway!! Them: performing a complicated Broadway musical song on Zoom with multiple people singing at once.\\n\\nMe: can’t even get Zoom to work for English class with only one mic on at once. Hamilton Cast: Singing the best hit of their life\\nJohn Krasinski: just vibin\\nGirl: prayin I didn\\'t realize that I was smiling until my cheeks started to hurt. \"It\\'s pronounced Kraniki.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBEST LINE EVER J: \"How is the weather looking?\"\\nR: \"Looks... Looks pretty good\"\\n\\nLaughed out loud. @PedalBox No spoilers! :D @Rachael Elder Comedy gold! Same - I lost it OMG ahaha I\\'m so glad you didn\\'t put more than \\'R\\'. I saw, I wondered, I wasn\\'t disappointed Elin Lund yea that was really good When Lin started singing I felt like he was staring into my soul though I guess that little girl is going to be able to see Hamilton early...like in five days. No one:\\n\\nLin-Manuel Miranda: 👁👄👁 XD comments killed me Who else is here to watch this after watching the movie on Disney+? :D John Krasinski became the best talk show host without ever having a talk show It’s not new to him😂 He made the sensational A Quiet Place without ever growing up watching horror movies. He’s a natural haha @Anne Napoli and Trump!!!! Or aw t least Don Jr! Sprinkle a little spice on it! Can we just have Jon Stewart join this, and then this will Win the Internet?!! Shaun Riley \\n\\nAhh....I get it , You’re a Trump snowflake.  Your life must be entirely consumed by politics. That explains a lot. \\n\\nBut hey, listen up!\\n\\nMaybe try keeping that shit to yourself. @Yannick Guiton negative on who? The cast of Hamilton are not the best people... the disgusting words and acts they had towards the countries leadership was clearly uncalled for and cowardice. She is like the luckiest girl in the world I really really love Hamilton! If I was her I would probably cry! No lie that would be awsome!😃 6:54 \\nIgnore this. Its just so I can find Robert De Niro again. I can’t wait till some rich guy notices me and says “hey wanna have the entire cast of Hamilton perform for you?” I bawled at how speechless Aubrey got---so happy that everyone put the effort they did for her! No one is acknowledging his Office reference. “First of all: how dare you” not everything said in the office is an office only thing. That\\'s just a thing people say lmao. Roses are red\\nShrek is an ogre\\nBUTTLICKER OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER @Micah N. You are correct Suku Tangan that was Dwight... I might be crazy? I thought that was when Jim pretended to be Dwight. He\\'s extremely talented...\\nLucky Lucky #MaryPoppins  😉 You\\'re the best !!! @EmilyBlunt  💓[You Guy\\'s HAVE TO BE THE COOLEST PARENTS🤘] I can only imagine Aubrey\\'s reaction to finding out Hamilton on Disney+ That first cast member set the piece up nice—real smooth. There\\'s definitely a reason he got the accolades he did for his Burr.  Guy\\'s a freekin magician with his voice! 👍👍 I agree! The great Lesley Odom, Jr. That man is powerful and magnetic every time he sings! 💖🎤👍 14:43 just noticed Jonathan Groff was there too lol singing his heart out I had to cancel my 21st birthday Hamilton show but my husband even though he\\'s across the country on base got me my birthday Hamilton. He bought me Hamilton on vinyl! John: Darling, what should we do during this quarantine?\\n\\nEmily: Let\\'s break the Internet.\\n\\nJohn: Ok, I\\'ll just make a few calls. Didnt dwight say \"identity theft isnt a joke\" 0:36 “First of all, how dare you? And second, your right!” -John krasinski, 2020 I would literally die if the cast of hamilton sang to me while Jim Halpert and Mary Poppins watched am I the only one who cried when they started singing 😭😭 We need more people like John Krasinski 😭 Some people say that we\\'re doing horrible. Obviously they haven\\'t watched SGN yet. THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING A HUMAN BEING HAS EVER DONE!!!! AND AM A FREAKING MEDICAL DOCTOR How can anyone dislike this??? It\\'s uplifting and inspired. Those who don\\'t must have like dried up crispy souls that have smells coming off them and darkness in their eyes!! John Krasinski is officially the most wholesome celebrity ever. Your SGN sign needs to end up in the Smithsonian Institute...it is a National Treasure that needs to be preserved 😷❤️👍🏼 Her face is everything. This is the goodness this show provides John Krasinski has officially won the best channel on YT! \\n\\n\\nOh and TY for making my day and everyone\\'s day\\n\\n\\nu even made my mom cry from happiness\\n\\n\\nKeep this up dude!! “I know it is a tough one. It’s pronounced kraninki... kraninki” John Krasinski: and heres the part of the show that I call, what did I miss-\\nMy entire family getting annoyed with me because I\\'m scream singing \"what did I miss\" from Hamilton 15:39\\nEveryone: Smiling and saying goodbye\\nChristopher Jackson: *F R O W N* Dang it’s really admirable how far John will go to make his fans day. Talking with the girl: 8:28 \\nLin-Manuel Miranda: 10:35\\nHamilton Performance: 11:30 I really want Robert De Niro to just be a recurring character saying one phrase about the weather. Brad did pretty well Yessssss please💀🖤 @Mama Natural thanks! YES. THIS. JOHN, THIS. Thank you so much...Exactly what we all need Some Good News!! I comment this on his every video, \\nTHE WORLD DOESN\\'T DESERVE JOHN KRASINSKI. Daveed diggs could hit me with a semi and i would say thank you Someone give John Krasinski a late night show for once and for all HOW IS SHE JUST COVERING HER MOUTH, WHY ISNT SHE LEGIT SCREAMING AND CRYING AND LITERALLY JUMPING WITH EXCITEMENT! my zoom online class: no one in sync, everyone’s glitching, 5 people are muted\\nsgn zoom glass: performs hamilton in perfect harmony my classes online were: no one is in sync, the teacher is glitching, half the class isnt even there, someone is muted, someones playing with backgrounds and someones little brother or sister is yelling in the background. @Cordaro Rodriguez Likely the sequence of events was that John contacted the girl and her parents and got consent to have her on the show. Then they went to the Hamilton crew, secured their permissions, recorded and edited that material (sharing all the appropriate video files so all the actors could sync), showed the girl the edited footage and recorded her reactions, then went through additional editing for the final SGN show. @Cordaro Rodriguez She could have been acting, but most likely they prerecorded and synced the video for her to watch first (shared the video on the call and recorded her reaction), then re-edited all he footage for YouTube. I really need to know how he did this, lol @Moses Ramirez definitely, but what I\\'m very curious about is what was presented to the little girl, because at the end of the call, you can see everyone in their various shaped zoom squares, rather than the perfect rectangles we saw during the song. Although we saw a polished product after the fact, she had to be watching something live on Zoom. What did she see and hear? I\\'ve been trying to figure out how to do this for two weeks. I even tried showing pre-recorded \"live\" content  through zoom and zoom compressed the music terribly. Still no luck. This seems like a lifetime ago at the start of lockdown 15:39\\nEveryone: Saying goodbye and smiling\\nChristopher Jackson: *F R O W N* im wondering if hamilton will still be hapening cause i really wanna see it also, why did i just notice jonathon groff after watching this like 15 times... I was literally jumping out of my seat and singing along, how was she not doing the same?? This kid lucked out she doesn’t even know how ridiculously incredible this literal reunion of Hamilton is I can’t believe it, I’m jealous!\\n(Edit: I know she loved it baha I was j saying she is SOOOO lucky) Agreed! She is too young to the miracle she beheld. Boose ya no i wasn’t saying she didn’t know what it was I mean it’s such and amazing experience I know she knew what was happening and it’s amazing it did I think she was just in hella shocked omg i know I would be she was probably trying to act cool   CAUSE WHEN ELSE WOULD SHE GET TO BE ON A CALL WITH ALL THESE CELEBS OMG Chloe Anne she was literally in shock. I think she knows how lucky she is... IKR I wanted to see the original cast but I missed it she’s so luckyyy THESE are examples of celebrities who do it RIGHT! I have so much respect for them using their fame & talent to bring joy to even the littlest big fans. And her face of utter shock was PRICELESS!! 😁 I AM BRITISH AND WHEN SHE SAID MARY POPPINS CLIMBED UP THE TOWER OF LONDON I WAS SO PRESSED 😂 So no one’s gonna talk about the Tom Brady bit? That was funny and I don’t even know who that person is or what John’s talking about! HOW IS SHE NOT CRYING IF I WAS ON A ZOOM WITH ANTHONY RAMOS AND HE STARTED SINGING I WOULD CRY AND SCREAM HSHSHWHWHEJ John Krasinski is possibly the coolest human being to walk the earth. Have u all forgotten about Keanu Reeves already Our generation’s Tom Hanks. No, sorry that\\'s the super epic and kind neighborhood cinnamon roll, Anthony Ramos. Correction: He floats above the earth. @Albert Bareno I\\'m a fan of both too.  I\\'m not a huge fan of religions, and then there is Scientology.  Takes a special person to join that cult. Hamilton Cast: Singing the best hit of their life\\nJohn Krasinski: just vibin\\nGirl: prayin As someone said on the other page, “I want to be in the zoom where it happened” 😂😂😂 0:39 How dare you? 🤣🤣 Love those small jokes why are people staying lin can’t sing? when he held that note i was amazed it was so perfect Episode 1: “How could John ever top an interview with Steve Carell?”\\n\\nEpisode 2: *entire Hamilton scene for one amazing fan* You mean Robert De Niro? And Robery DeNiro How I lived before I disovered this channel, I don\\'t know As someone who works in a doctors office : we arent allowed to wear all those homemade masks people make for us. Because they arent FDA standard and we have no way of knowing if they\\'re sterile or not or how well they work. bro how is she just sitting there...i would have ✨passed away✨ ',\n",

This will help give your neck support when you lay down. I watch this to try and learn how to sleep better, instead I get a completely unwanted advertisement for a pillow.

       " 'The fact that Trump showed this with the MSM reporters in the room is such a gangster move. He\\'s the best. B M my birthday is february 1st. On my birthday I read about trump beginning travel bans on china. I cant say he did much more than that. I think most commentators are frustrated when the news ignores things like how trump gave historically black universities 5 times more than obama did but theyll replay one 3 second clip of him saying something like \"blacks have nothing to lose by voting for me\". Thats not to say fox news wasnt equally as petty during their off-season presidencies. Just as many progressives are radical and ridiculous as conservatives. Its nothing our civics system cant handle though. @Millenial King - I never said you did..I read the tomatillo/tomato comparison. I used that as an example because like you said you got involved with H (hillbilly guy). I am aware that we are a huge country and not to sound condescending that is why the words \"per capita\" come in... kind like proportional based on population. You can go back and read my comments. Again I would like you to comment on the evidence  what Trump said or what he did during the month of February. I am not the topic or subject and you have not being right on any because your filter still on and you keep ignoring the facts and prefered to move to something else (just like 45 did with the reporter). Some of the commentators here said and praise how bad ass that presentation by him was...I see it as that reporter handed his ass back to him (or bitch-slapped if you preferred)and more importantly I was expecting him to come the next day do another one proving/showing the reporter  how she was wrong and he was right....but no just crickets from everyone on the administration. As a matter of fact I can predict he will not do that again because it backfired and anyone not been MAGAtized will know that multiple channels/news outlets put montages like the daily show exposing the truth. And since you watch all the news I am sure this is not new to you based on the facts that have been on the air for a couple of days... yet you have not addressed it or just chose to ignore it why? is it \"fake news\"....the President did nothing to prepare the country for the pandemic during February.  You feel it is easier to just  turn to me and try to define me or explain what or whom I am without any actual information..as an explanation for 45s lack of performance or dereliction of duty?. You don\\'t have to answer that last question the topic /subject still is 45\\'s performance during the month of February. @Millenial King - I watched all the news and  I speak spanish as part of my assignments and military career. I am aware  of other countries on this side of the hemisphere and Asia specially the poorer ones. La situacion en Ecuador es horrible con las personas tirando los cadaveres en las calles y nadie reclamandolos. I have family in Europe and Latin America. Again..you are redherring and it is you that is pointing to red or blue. If you like I can copy paste your remarks about me that you made without knowing anything. i addressed several times your obsession with me and not the topic. If you paid attention I addressed your inaccuracies and lack of facts. .Ok, and sometimes more colorful than needed..I\\'ll admit that. Unlike you I questioned what we could have done better...because of the current results. I would not considered measuring us to \"third world\" countries (and I don\\'t like that term). The bar should be higher than Ecuador or Peru. B M and for the record, i never argued the definitions of socialism, communism or capitalism. In fact, i made a joke about someone trying to say that two of those were the same thing. What say you about the fact that we are a huge country? Youre comparing new zealand to the US when its better to compare it to like... the state of new mexico. Taiwan is like ... maine and iceland is like... iowa... how can you compare such differences using only the accumulative totals, while disregarding all other variables? Pretty convenient if you ask me. B M if you watch spanish news you can see videos of them burning bodies in the streets in peru and ecuador. In england they are yelling to the police \"why cant we sunbathe?!\" In ecuador theyre yelling \"GET RID OF THE BODIES THEYRE INFECTING EVERYTHING!\". Between me and my wife we have family in every continent except africa and theyre all doing worse than we are, in that, they cant even get supplies. I can still get texas roadhouse so ... by what standards are we doing worse? Because the news says so? You are trying to be independent, i get that, but if you view everyone else as either red or blue then you miss out on all the purples. President Trump has more patience for these fools than they deserve. @PWD123 only became the dumbfuck channel when you got involved, idiot. zinderkugel us Your mommy said you left your meds in the basement again B. life \\nGood one. You are starting to win me over. @B M dang presented you links and still wrong. Maybe we should fact check these sites, you think? Man you are one intelligent individual! Why aren\\'t you giving these reports for all of us each day or at least giving this moron of an administration advice on how to demonstrate the truth and perfect stability with this virus? I\\'d vote for you BM!  Was this the schooling you where talking about taking me too earlier or is that what that means? Doesnt matter I\\'m sure you\\'ll lemme know lol.. you dont have to respond my friend you can move on to belittle the next unlucky bastard and I\\'ll just keep on crossing my fingers in Hope\\'s I\\'ll find my way one day, Maybe on November 3. @B. life - you are wrong again, the President cannot overruled any state when the governors are protecting their citizens regardless of emergency status.  45 made that statement..then when challenged by the media and Governors he back down to ..\"he could persuade them\"..\"because they need the federal government\"..to today saying  \\'he will let the Governors do it as they see fit\". Nothing new that is the story.. he makes a false assertions, states a lie, then a day or hours later backpedals because he doesn\\'t know what he is talking about..sounds familiar?..any patterns??. They should show the faces of the press while watching the clips. @sptt 144 I still watch those videos on youtube absolutely priceless LOL!! @Are You Coherent 😂😅😂😅😂 @PWD123 LoL....that is the extent of your proof? @nhlpa17 Speak for yourself. The only one getting laughed at is you. I\\'m assuming you don\\'t even live here, otherwise you would know what a great country this is. If you do live here maybe you should leave, since it is people like you that bring this country down. I suggest moving to China, go see how much better it is there, I dare you. Ramon Loteria \\nPresident Trump DID NOTHING DURING FEBRUARY about the pandemic. Yes! Be proud  of your small minded, blame everyone else dork. Way to go. I fell off my chair when I saw this..........he just redefined epic. Lol Better than cable TV lol 😁😁 https://youtu.be/yIQBaVxilu8 CNN and MSNBC went to break when he showed this clip. Lmao they didn\\'t want see themselves get embarrassed!\\nTRUMP 2020!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 @Mista JC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump_(2020)\\nhttps://factba.se/topic/calendar @Mark Mc he didn\\'t go on any golf trips. Where are u getting your information from? @Mista JC Did you even watch the video? From Jan. 31 till March 11, what did he do to handle this crisis besides the CDC releasing a Covid-19 test that did not work and they recalled?  Had a meeting? Seriously, that\\'s all he did? Oh wait, he went on 3 golf trips to Mara Lago so I guess he was doing something.. @Mark Mc You\\'re asking the wrong questions. What did you, Americans, do while it\\'s becoming pandemic? Oh, remember what the Spring Breakers did while Florida was on lockdown? @Mark Mc U have to remember that Trump was on an impeachment trial from December 18 through February 5. But still, in February he put travel restrictions for china, and by doing that he triggered the left, calling him a racist and shameful and wrong. In March he also hosted a meeting and talked to many different medical groups to come up with a plan for vaccines or treatments for the virus and also spoke to the press about it afterwards. He declared a national emergency,  put a travel ban to and from Europe, etc. Did u even watch this video, or are u going to call all of the clips in it fake? President Trump has Officially put the MSM in their place (and once again exposed their misinformation & propaganda).   Trump 2020 steven le your candidate doesnt know what office he is running for @Javier Varela except that never actually happened. steven le is that the best you can do? You don’t need to answer because we know that is the best you can do… Your weapons grade more on getting crushed in the free market of ideas… Get used to it because it’s just beginning 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 @steven le You already lost, you will be driven out of every western country. Javier Varela .....what did the democrats do in February? Tell people it wasn’t anything to be concerned about and to continue to socialize and attend get togethers. Right Nancy?? *PRESIDENT Trump* took the media down\\nThat\\'s Beautiful Mark Haupt Well, thank you for making my case. As regards other countries whose press briefings are not embarrassing  bar room brawls, check out Taiwan, Finland and Germany, just for starters. Nations which have done much, much better at containing the threat of sars 2, Covid-19. Coincidentally, these are nations with female heads of state. You would much rather have a sexual predator President  who makes Jabba the Hutt a paragon of virtue. I don’t have contempt or disgust for you Mark, I just feel sorry for you. @Mike McAuley l just googled jacinda ardern and all that came up was a picture of Mr Ed the talking horse, also the other countries that have leaders that talk calmly and rationally are they Russia and China. Your an idiot and should be treated as such  with contempt and disgust. Smith & Wesson In other countries, the premiers, prime ministers and presidents address their people and talk calmly and professionally to their people, citing the scientific experts. They answer the tough questions from the press and, when they struggle to answer, don’t call their press fake. for a perfect example of that watch the Prime minister of New Zealand, Jancinda Ardern talk to the New Zealand public. Guys, before you go all bigly ‘fake news, liberal, communist, CNN sycophant etc’... just google  ‘Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand press briefings’. listen and watch  before you go apoplectic. I realise most of you won’t even know where New Zealand is, but nevertheless, this is how democracy goes on elsewhere. Watching what happens in the US at these briefings, suggests your country is totally dysfunctional. @Smith & Wesson sorry id rather listen to accredited scientists and read actual scientifc papers on climate change than some dude cherry picking arguments that pander to an uneducated audience. Media: President Trump, why didn\\'t you know everything before we did?\\nPresident Trump: roll tape\\n\\nall of us: rolling on the floor laughing @avegoodtime \\xa0please hand the phone back to your parents or responsible adult. @avegoodtime  please hand the phone back to your parents or responsible adult. @avegoodtime please hand the phone back to your parents or responsible adult. @Helicamman he was briefed by the CIA, who told him China was lying. Trump chose to believe Xi Jinping @avegoodtime Pretty sure he was going off who\\'s information at first, we all know how that went dont we. Its great to finally see a Republican President who gives it back to the MSM. I love my President. Outstanding. Let\\'s see more rebuttals like this. Well done Mr. President. 2020. You have my vote in November.  Maybe show some to that douche Jim acosta @William Croft Hillary for prison @B M yep, Trump couldn\\'t tell a reporter what he did the ENTIRE MONTH OF FEBRUARY to prepare for the worst pandemic in a century. @B M Anything and everything the man did do..the democrats fought IT..T.D.S.. Still Blocking..Still..And They WILL All The WAY To.2024.. legend hast it that he never answered the question \"what did you do during the month of February to prepare the country?\" after he played that irrelevant montage. No one in the administration came to his defense nor provided any evidence because they know the answer is nothing was done. However you can find out what he actually was saying or texting with a simple YT search like \"what did Pres. Trump said during February\"..Here is a montage just like his..and shows why he refused to answer the question from that  tenacious reporter and not surprisingly you fools drank the kool-aid as \"wow how brave he was\".  The search provided this..   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raKm5wrpRK4     very easy..and again this are his words and texts. And as of this week as a reminder we have over 30K deaths 600K infections (without even proper testing of the population roughly a bit over 1% has been tested). We are leading the world in per capita results. @Freebird 🤣👏 BOOM!\\nRight back at YA LIARS IN THE MSM!\\nBOOYAH! B M pls remember  Trump 2020, Trump 2024, Candace owens 2032, Ivanka 2040 and your dead  again @Bokyo Bokya -buttercup don\\'t engage with adults without your parents present. @Marie Tallwater - that is not saying much given your own condition.... @B M You\\'ve got to have one of the worst case of Trump Derangement Syndrome I\\'ve ever seen. 🤔 @Marie Tallwater - that is what elections are for...but that doesn\\'t change the topic..which is Trump\\'s incompetence dealing with the pandemic. I get it... like him you want to talk about everything else. \\nMight as well tell me how the moon effects the tidal waves on earth..or how sardines are brought into to shallower waters by warm currents...the list and topics is endless. But, so far..your ignorance is not a reason to believe or take seriously anything you say..so you telling me \"he is going to be reelected\" is like you saying he weighs 239lbs..his orange skin color is natural, or he has a vocabulary that exceeds 25 words. Even if he does it would not change the facts..he was impeached...he is stupid, and his followers are hilarious. By the way where you at any of those rallies and did you get interviewed??. I just loved seeing the media\\'s faces when this got played. Called out on their hypocrisy. He really should just spend 5 minutes each day highlighting media bias and bullshit. Hahahahaha!!! Love it!!!! Go get em President Trump!!!! https://youtu.be/6yd5iauoeKw\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/WA9cYsCf8zM\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/xI3IMRy03fg Trump setting idiots straight is what I live for.

You are occupied by an illusion of political struggle. @Mark Mc To keep yourself from looking ignorant its important to know the facts before you knee jerk react. @nhlpa17 And you turn to insults when you can\\'t support your claims. @nhlpa17 Fox was sold to Disney (pedophiles) @Adam Boyd Its called Project Mockingbird and the CIA is behind  it. But they aren\\'t Americans with our values. From what Ive gathered they are Nazi\\'s (Project Paperclip) No wonder the MSM doesn\\'t want to cover his briefings. He is taking them to task. Tony Winikerei If you’re going to communicate to other people by typing, at least type like you’ve got an IQ over 12. @Hi There geez wish I was smart like you \" boy...you a clever mama\" I didn\\'t  go to school .parents couldn\\'t  afford it. Who cares  I say what I want ...🤣🤣 Tony Winikerei Their ≠ They’re Yeah.!!! Their full of shit...😣 President Trump doing what PRESIDENT TRUMP does best, expose the MSM, FAKE NEWS extravaganza ! @Don whit what is CNN ? PWD pipercat.  cnn has you right where they want you PWD wow even with the videos that prove mainstream media lies you still defend them. Baa baa you stupid Sheep 🤣 pipercat10 \\nA true leader would have known more sooner than the press and done more sooner. \\nThis comparison is for fools. Like you? I am one of those people who am trapped in Asia because the president chose to immediately ban flights back to the United States.\\nAlthough I regret not being with my family, I still support the president’s decision to do the safest thing for the people United States.\\nPresident Trump deserves the highest respect for his quick decisions and quick response. Rose Treiger \\nThank you Rose. God has a purpose for everything. Even being here in Palawan, I have discovered a great purpose and honor to utilize my time and skills for the future benefits of God‘s kingdom.\\nThanks may not always turn out the way we want them to be, but they always turn out the way God knew they would be. If you align yourself with God’s plan, then you can never go wrong. li d \\nTo be specific, it was the Philippines that first banned flights early in March because they didn’t want to end up like the United States.\\nThe United States was a little bit slower at figuring out what was going on and their flights begin to cancel around 1 April.\\nAnd those are not lies, I know because I’m constantly checking both US and a International airlines hoping that I can be back with my family by my birthday.  \\nBut honestly, as miserably as Americans are failing to control this virus, I think I will be lucky if I make it back home by August at the earliest.   At least that is the estimate I am getting from Customer Service from the US side li d, Do you even know where you are? Im sorry that happened to you. but you have a great attitude and love. Come home soon. we miss you As he should have. The MSM has been out of control for years, bout time they got put in their place. This is the greatest burn of all from trump. Making these media fools sit there and listen to their own propaganda. 👌😂 THIS IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS A RALLY Dark to light Man, say what you want about him, the man has balls lmfao Its very sad that they abuse freedom of the press to include lying about their own country, what a bunch of sad losers...and i\\'m not even American. @Akansh Arya goodbye Troll @Akansh Arya \"China has a population of more than 1.4b and is a well developed country.\" Yeah so developed that they began to have a Carbon Dioxide crisis and their kids had to literally wear masks just to stay safe.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/07/01/china-emits-more-carbon-dioxide-than-the-u-s-and-eu-combined/#4ad6a04d628c\\n\\n\\nAnyways back to topic, 1. \"They just can\\'t cut off this giant economy just because of a disease, and by that time it wasn\\'t even known that this was contagious...\"\\n\\n\\nThey already knew it was contagious and yet only took minimal action from keeping it to themselves.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSdQPtciBRg&t=377s\\n\\n\\n2. \"Well when china did declare that it was contagious and caused by a virus that can\\'t be stopped by present day medicine, did your leader put a lockdown?\"\\n\\n\\nFeb 5, he was already getting ready for the pandemic and also tried to block all transports to China, until this happened:\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEpiMr1FvdM&t=387s\\n\\n\\n(Recommend this guy, he was once a very far left democrat but is now neutral.)\\n\\n\\n3. \"Well let me tell you that during chinese new year the first lockdown ie 12th February, the country was on a complete lockdown....by 27th Feb ther were more than 3k+ confirmed deaths and when did the lockdown start in usa?\"\\n\\n\\nIf you watched the last link I\\'ve posted, before Feb 24th, Nancy said she knew about the virus yet during that she was encouraging people to go out and do things. So no, the states didn\\'t go into lock down and didn\\'t because Nancy said so.\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t the president overrule the governer and make decision on his behalf...?\"\\n\\n\\nYet again, Nancy said so. And because, \"Orange man bad.\" You\\'ll be surprised how dumb most people are here in the US. Most people\\'s hatred towards Trump make them do the opposite of what Trump says. Kinda jealous of you guys.\\n\\n\\nJust to make it clear, this is not in any case hostile towards you. I\\'m just doing this to answer your questions to us. So, sorry if it sounds hostile and no hard feelings.\\n\\n\\nHope you continue to have a healthy life! \\n\\n\\n(P.S. this is your comment towards Silver girl, so it isn\\'t entirely answering all the other posts you did.) Akansh Arya China is 100% RESPONSIBLE for this WORLDWIDE CATASTROPHE THEY CAUSED!  The fact that you don’t know that means you are buying into the communist propaganda GLOBALIST left wing agenda that would have you believe different, you’re a sheep and need to change your news source.  How about Epoch News. They get torched (literally) by the CCP often just to keep real news out to people- try looking them up. China wouldn’t even let their own scientists and doctors give any out important information that they tried so frantically to do- they killed them and others are missing. They KNEW it was important to the world that it would cause this pandemic that they risked their own lives to do it, and lost, and here you don’t even believe them- lives in vein? China has some serious explaining to do! They OF COURSE don’t want people to know they are responsible for it, why do think they have made all those dumb stock videos and photos, and I’m not talking about the good people of China (who have snuck out information saying now that they know all these things that we have suspected), I’m talking about the communist Chinese leadership- but it STARTED THERE, ORIGINATED THERE AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH AMERICA or President Trump! It came out of a lab in Wuhan - it started there, and rather it was meant to be a mistaken release (probably) as they were working on chemical warfare or not, they withheld information from the world to better their own situation gaining time to collect medical supplies and better their position as to know what to do in their mess up- causing thousands of needless deaths and economic meltdowns worldwide- not allowing America to enter when Trump asked them to back in the first week of January as he was trying to assist them and also gain information. Which is why President Trump wisely removed the United States funding from the World Health Organization today. The leader of which has spent his time covering up China’s continued corruption these last 4 months instead of helping the world in this most strenuous situation. The leader has been a poor choice from the beginning of the organization- you can look up his past. As per the drug you’re referring to, that again is another baffling situation where when tagged with Trump is being badmouthed. IF IT’S SAVING LIVES, ALLOW PEOPLE THE FREEDOM TO TRY IT! It’s better than being dead! Tom Hanks used it, but doing fine but now because he’s part of the anti- Trump regime (being an elite) and is feeling the need to go around talking shmack about it- same with a bunch of other people who, I’m seeing are finding this a good ploy to use this as a great way to get back at Trump. I’m seeing that many people on the left are using this horrendous time as a great time to take advantage of their situation any way they can- people on the left are pushing bills through that have nothing to do with the coronavirus just because they can and people are under duress and like the drug- people are using it to their advantage. It’s baffling doctors from France and Australia and here in America who have saved countless lives with that combination of medication already with it- AND SAFELY. They did a small test study of 200 people at first finding that 198 of them survived with the treatment and without side effects- so why wouldn’t you use it? A few close to death have made amazing comebacks- if you get it, will you ask for it? I wonder. The medication has been around - both of them for 80 years all ready and approved by the FDA, I already take it because I have lupus- the other is just a z-pack. There’s nothing obscure about this medicine- It only causes heart issues, and only with few, when taken over a period of 2-3 years, that’s how partisan these stupid fuckers are! As for America’s response time, Trump was one of the first to cut off flights from China- being called racist for doing so, saving countless lives with that move- however, we won’t ever really know how many lives are saved or not saved in these situations, everyone seems to think it’s so easy to sit back and criticize from behind after things pan out- we just want a strong leader at the wheel of our ship that can make decisions fearlessly and not lead from behind. Not all states are the same in America, as I’ve explained each state is governed by individual governors that decide what to do for their individual state so at this point, yes, every state is shut down. But some states only had a few cases and weighed that with the economic damage that would accrue, we still had crops that needed to get to the rest of the country - some states have people that live miles and miles apart from each other and farm. Each state is different and that’s why it’s up to the governor to manage their own state and the president to oversee all of it. It simply wasn’t necessary for some states to “shut down’’ that soon - some only had like 50 or less cases. So, what looks like something to you over in India, might be something totally different happening on the ground here in America. So, let’s review, here are what the Chinese are responsible for: Asian flu of 1957, Hong Kong flu of 1968, 1997 bird flu, outbreak 2003, SARS epidemic, COVID-19. You tell me if you think they don’t have some explaining to do to the entire world?!! I THINK THEY SURE AS HELL DO! @Akansh Arya New York is closed in elbow to elbow with the largest Chinese population in the United States in which many many Chinese family members flew in and out of the country for months get that through you\\'re head \"Months\" and no telling how many other infected flew in from other countries as well New York is a business state the flight volume is insane don\\'t try to act like it ain\\'t 🤣 @Mr. Chaos dude is New York more densely populated that Delhi...?\\nIndra Gandhi international airport here in Delhi is also one of the most busiest airports....\\nAnd when the chinese did tell about the virus did your govt. take all the actions required to stop it from spreading....?\\nStill there are states where there is no lockdown -_- Inconvenient facts expose MSM lies. @PWD123 suck it up, hag. Mark Johnson \\n\\nNot even close you dork.\\n\\nSigned,\\nTRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT Mark Johnson \\n\\nWeirdo @PWD123 He did make some mistakes ( as result of \" experts\" also minimizing the danger), but don\\'t deny that -- especially in regard to the two examples given --  he was hampered by the usual sufferers of TDS.\\nIf you actually gave a damn you\\'d focus your nasty gaze as scrupulously on Dems who mocked any notion of danger\\nYou\\'d also focus on deceptive China the lies from which robbed the world of two months prep time\\nAlso focus on the utter failure by WHO.\\nBut no, creeps like you see death and suffering as opportunities for point scoring. Mark Johnson \\n\\nThe MSM was not saying those things about his China response widely and you should know that.  That was the bullshit Trump was saying when he knew he F-ed up his response. Look up the numerous times he played down the pandemic while his advisers said otherwise. lmao theyre getting rekt daily by the don 😭😭 Love it The Liberal Mainstream Media is the Enemy of the People! After their coverage of the Wuhan Virus, there is no doubt about it. Have you ever seen anyone defend a foreign nation that is considered one of America\\'s greatest enemies, To have poisoned the nation, so boldly? That kind of loyalty only comes from an employee. You go POTUS - fight for the truth to be heard over the death cough of Fake News MSM! @Bokyo Bokya THERE IT IS THE HYPOCRITE REPUBLICAN BULLSHIT , IF A LIFE IS INSIDE THE WOMB ITS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE SAVED AT ALL COSTS BUT ONCE IT\\'S OUTSIDE THE WOMB WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT IT BECAUSE MONEY AND REPUBLICAN LIES ARE TO IMPORTANT.\\nFUCKING HYPOCRITE REPUBLITARD BULLSHIT.\\nTRUMP BABY WANS TO KILL AMERICANS FOR HIS PRECIOUS ECONOMY BUT YOU DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THAT DO YOU , PLUS THE FACT THAT HES ALREADY KILLED THEM BY WAITING 2 1/2 MONTHS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING. zinderkugel us don’t worry if ever you’ll die with covid. Remember that your country killing 300,000 defenceless babies a year by abortion. One life not enough to repay those little souls. @Bokyo Bokya I\\'M SURE IF TRUMP CONTINUES HIS IGNORANT WAYS WE\\'LL ALL GET TO SUFFER FROM COVID AND I SEE YOU AWESOME TRUMPTARDS PUTTING COMMENTS HOPING THAT YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS GET A VIRUS THAT CAN KILL THEM .\\nWITH THE ASSHOLE TRUMP IN OFFICE IT\\'S ABOUT TIME TO CHANGE THE NAME FROM UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO REPUBLICANS WILL DO WHATEVER A DUMBASS SAYS. @Bokyo Bokya I\\'M SURE IF TRUMP CONTINUES HIS IGNORANT WAYS WE\\'LL ALL GET TO SUFFER FROM COVID AND I SEE YOU AWESOME TRUMPTARDS PUTTING COMMENTS HOPING THAT YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS GET A VIRUS THAT CAN KILL THEM .\\nWITH THE ASSHOLE TRUMP IN OFFICE IT\\'S ABOUT TIME TO CHANGE THE NAME FROM UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO REPUBLICANS WILL DO WHATEVER A DUMBASS SAYS. zinderkugel us  stop sniffing drugs instead sniff the virus. I call that leadership.  Even if you hate the Pres. give him space to do his job.  I ask you.  Also watch out for your neighborhood. @Rocket man. in the age of Propaganda?  LMAO, whatever it is, it worked. It\\'s Propaganda . Stupid. Trump has handled this moment in history very well considering all the pushback and lieing and actions by the democratic party and the media that they pay to spread their hate Where we go one we go all...\\n\\n\\n\\nThankQ mr.president TEAM TRUMP♡2Q2Q♡ POTUS mic drop🎤🖐 He\\'s playing chess while the msm is trying to play checkers!!! @Ronda Meier hahaha yee! :V @marqueso1600 👏👍 lol so very true!!! @J Brooks 4D Chess vs Chinese checkers to be exact!!! HAHA they\\'re having trouble keeping the marbles out their mouths!!!!! Good one!! President Trump l, said in your face. How do you like me now! Trump took the MSM to the Cleaners again!! Tomorrow they will say he was not Presidential for showing the truth of their folly and lies! @EyesOpen2018 - It is not about who wins.....as my opinion I will say that is our actual dysfunction problem. If you listen to our Congress they are less concern with what is right..what is true..what is needed ..it has become we have to win. So if someone decides to talk for 24h just to filibuster and stop something they will do it just to win.  \\nThis year I have seen things that I would never thought possible in our government. I can\\'t care less who wins in Nov. as long as reigns are enforced so that we don\\'t have to deal with the misery, death, and incompetence that I have witness. Only short sighted and ignorant people see all of these as a \"winning\" issue, so don\\'t bunched me up on that group..as for voting is a common action among democracies ..it is the law in the US. And yes voting is great and so is accountability. I am living in the now...not Nov...30K+ dead..600K infection cases..just 1+% of the population tested. Nothing to brag about. BM, in sincerity your viewpoints were concise and from your heart. We will see which candidate will win in November. I will be in the voting booth with my identification for voting 🗳 for Trump. May the best candidate win. Also, remember in the USA 🇺🇸 we have to do this again in 4 years. Our Republic is amazing!😊 @EyesOpen2018 -lol.... I haven\\'t and something on my chest is not the issue nor I will feel better knowing that some of the 30k+ that have died could have been avoided with a more mature or connected administration or leadership. Perhaps your life experiences are different from mine and I view death..unnecessary deaths and suffering differently. I can not just brushed off what we are living as an internal emotion..when the consequences can be so drastic and engulfing everything we do. Again..our views and takes are very different. Same wishes for you and loved ones. B M, alrighty then. I am glad you got your point off your chest. May you and your family and friends stay safe and healthy during this pandemic. Peace. No... what they are saying is after that false montage of time irrelevant quotes/videos.. he could not answer a simple repeated question from a reporter \"Mr. president what did you do during the month of February to prepare the country for the pandemic?\". Of course you would have the entire administration put a response to the reporter\\'s question, after all she bitch-slapped the president\\'s face repeatedly from side to side. The best he could muster at the times was \"you are fake\"..\"your ratings are bad\". I am sure the next day they/he came up with another presentation like the previous one addressing the question and humiliating that insolent reporter...right??. Nope..it was crickets..I will predict we will not see such utter stupidity again (putting a fake unrelated montage like he did)..because within hours numerous channels put montages of videos and twits of what 45 did/say during the month of February. The answer is he didn\\'t do anything..he minimized it trying to stop the stock market from plummeting by giving the public false assurances and incorrect information..also know as lies. Reality just bitch-slapped you if I may. I believe that God placed President Trump in office because HE knew we would need him, for this virus and other battles. Why don’t you do this everyday\\nRobbing in their faces \\nEvery conference Alex 41.3 oh, did you cry when he did that ? Btw, that was already debunk long before you were born. Good for another cnn fake news antaresxp Should play the clip everytime they ask stupid question This is why I love our awesome President Trump, he calls it like he sees it. Prayers daily for President Trump, his family & administration ><> Oh, look at Mike Pence, dude knew what was coming. I had to go back to watch it just to look at him.. He surely knew what was coming 😆 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND AMERICA\\'S RECOVERY AND CALM FOR THE HORRIFIC PANDEMIC FROM CHINA...\\nTHANKS FOR THE PLANNING SKILLS AND FOCUS MR PRESIDENT...\\nAMERICA LOVE\\'S AMERICA AND YOU HAVE MY VOTE IN NOVEMBER 2020...\\nGOD BLESS AMERICA. Why did you go and show those videos MR.PRESIDENT ? Love this guy They need to do this more😂😂😂😂 2020 REDO. SAVAGELY the truth! Trolled and pwned God blessed America!!! THE CORRUPT MEDIA MUST HAVE THEIR BROADCAST LICENSES REVOKED / SUSPENDED. They tried to sue Rachel Maddow. When they got to court they found out that MSNBC is registered with the FCC as entertainment And is  not is a news source. So is CNN. With that the court decided, Even though they announce themselves as a news source, they are just entertainment and if your sucker enough to believe it, that\\'s your problem. Now they did get money out of her for libel. But not what they wanted. I think he could have shown more damming video clips but he still made his point Keeping it for the election time. Rightfully so. 🙏🙏 Make me laugh cnn More public shaming and video evidence against the media, please Mr. President. Paul Schuster It’s called FACTS, Paul ! This was such a huge FU and middle finger to the fake news media  it was absolutely priceless!! Great job Mr President   your doing a great job and I\\'m proud to to call you my President I stood up and gave a HUGE salute to that man (and I\\'m not even military!).  And just when we think he can\\'t get any better demolishing the media, he goes and does this!!..... Hurrah Mr. President! Trump should have this running on a loop in the background so CNN has to show it or not cover him at all This should be one of his campaign ads. I can picture the media being forced to watch this clip. Fingers in ears eyes closed and making annoying noises lol. Media is made up of a bunch of degenerates The FAKE NEWS MEDIA was SO FURIOUS that he showed this on primetime!!! 😂😂😂😛🎉🇺🇸🙏🏻🎊 #kag @Miami Heat lol only an idiot would use the china travel ban as a \\'strong move\\'.  Guess what fukkhead?  Most the US cases originated out of Australia and Europe.  So yeah good job idiot.  That China ban was so effective the US is the global leader now in cases and deaths.  Wooo hoo…  such a great job.  Facts matter and the china ban was a huge miss and he proceeded to sit on his hands for all of February instead of getting ready for this.  You have NO business calling anyone stupid when you post moronic stuff like this. nhlpa17 WASHINGTON POST??????? Really? You really are a pathetic Imbecile! I really look forward to you waking up miserable and suffering the next 4.5 years of YOUR President Trump Libtard buffoon! 😂😂😂😛🇺🇸 #kag Javier Varela Hey Idiot, it was to show that NOBODY knew or was taking the virus as serious as he was! He closed all travel from China on January 31, the epicenter of the virus, what are we supposed to shut down the whole country on conjecture and speculation? The video was absolutely brilliant! You just dont like  brilliance of it, using the own words of the libtard media against them! Nobody knew this would become such a contagious global pandemic, NOBODY! I hope the next 4.5 years of YOUR President Trump are as miserable to you as the first 3.5 years! 😂😂😂👍🏻😜 #kag @Miami Heat  hahaha  you are funny calling anyobody dumb when your argument is that he cherry picked.  I\\'m sorry that you fail to accept the evidence that fox repeatedly downplayed the virus on countless fox shows for months. Here you go meat head:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKbwDf51bA Miami Heat This must have been the most stupidest thing to show. WAH WAH WAH the main stream media is not being nice to me. Seriously grow the  F up. What was this orange face doing to prepare for the virus on February. When he knew in January. Oh yeah went golfing when on rarely calling the virus a whole Democratic hoax. Yup go on support that moron. You stupid idiot Republicans The NYTimes published articles praising and loving Adolph Hitler in the 1930\\'s.  They loved him because he was an ardent socialist. Didn’t c that coming 🤫🤣for the trillionth, gazillianth time I freaking love u president Trump! Best president ever🥳 Straight shooter, all with one finger without pulling the trigger 🧚🏼\\u200d♀️I’ll drink to that 🥂 He\\'d find you ugly though,😂just  like how the rest of the world would find you ugly too😂😂 That was great to see. All of America needs to see this video. “Pow”, the mainstream media is exposed to themselves and silenced. Trump 🇺🇸2020. Thank you for sharing Love it. Would like to see more clips on TV Ads and/or the upcoming Presidential Election Debates. 👍🏼 HAS TO BE SHOWN WHENEVER IT CAN I love trump trump trump I HATE The \"LAMESTREAM\" Fake News Media Outlets; He Needs To Do PRESENTATIONS Like This EVERYDAY!! \\\\m/🔥😈🔥 God fearing citizens support you Mr. President, we fully understand, what certain elements of the media are attempting to do you and our Nation! We see through their firewall of deceit and corruption. You speak of hope & freedom, they speak of control & restraint. America will survive and prosper due to her humble and persevering free citizens! 🇺🇸 Oh hell yeah !!!! cbs,nbc and abc all went to other programming when those videos started. Fox stayed with it. I am done with those fake news networks. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂He showed them a video of there bad reporting in the dark room and got up and basically said 🖕🏼😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Lol \"...even before they\\'ll end up going out of business...\"\\nBoom! Damn. Great video. Unfortunately these shameless \"journalists\" have no shame & will continue with there arrogant disruptive behaviour Someone probably already said this besides me, but I\\'ll say it too. It\\'s great we have a president who gives it right back the MSM. The man doesn’t play 🤣🤣 This Englishman loves President Trump!!! WWG1WGA Hahahahahahhahaha, damn I love this guy. I loved the video, was amazing, real slap on the face. I\\'ve watched loads of governer cumno press conferences, he always grateful for all the help he recieves, I can\\'t believe CNN called the video propaganda, in their bulletins on bottom of their screens, referred to it as propaganda, terrible terrible word to use, historically ramincations , awful, Awesome Video shows How The Press Is The Enemy Of The State He needs to use those monitors every time with the fake news media. Good for him!! Hahahahahahahahahahahahah trumps freaking awesome Imagine Bernie Sanders In This position right now lol Boom roasted I do remember the media being quite obsessed with impeachment while the Wuhan Coronavirus storm was brewing. I also screenshot many articles saying the flu was worse, the real problem is racism against Chinese and not this virus, the spread of fear is worse, and on and on. I used to feel the need to defend myself to my subordinates at work. And after every attempt to do so, I learned that it was ultimately futile because it was interpreted as an opportunity to further criticize and nothing was accomplished. Trump has every right to shut out the press during his national transmissions, in my opinion. Their soul focus is to further blind hatred and misinterpret on things that have been made very clear. What’s happening with the far-left media is disgraceful. You don\\'t need to convince me only those people who watch, CNN, NBC, ABC, PBS, CBS etc. Classic! 😊 BOOM~! Love it! This is awesome. I have been waiting for him to do this for years. Awesome 👏🏼 This was epic 🤣 BRING THEM DOWN! 2020 Well done DT. About time. Perfect! 😂😂✌ Bwaahahahahahahaha....\\nMost epic takedown ever !!!!\\nThank you, Mr. T..... Love this guy! This is wonder  !!! \\nIn fact, \"it was perfect\" !!! MSM hacks and propagandists had to watch their lies along with us.\\nThey should force all of these treasonous outlets to play their lies along with the true information in front of the entire viewing nation. Odds are the MSM had the same reaction to this video that George C. Scott had to watching his daughter\\'s porn movie in the 1979 film Hardcore. Or like Macolm McDowell\\'s reaction to watching the brainwashing video in 1971\\'s Clockwork Orange. Boem! I❤ this! President bashing the msm F yeah! 💪🏾💪🏾 respect and love from Holland Adored how he winds them up - and they always fall for it.   :-) Lmao I hope the fake journalist Acosta was there  😆 Right on! MSNBC and CNN crapped there pants after seeing this video🤣🤣 ',\n",
       " 'Lol, I love how you had to add in that \"if cutting this insults you, do so before the folding\" since some people believe if you cut or glue anything, it\\'s not origami. Amazing video though, keep up the great work! @LightedOrochi It\\'s fine, at least you said sorry to her :) Uhm.. sorry that I said that in your pin wheel video Thanks! Yes, you\\'d think most people would understand some prep goes into getting the right dimensions, some people even comment \"it\\'s not origami\" on models using pentagonal shaped paper :) Whenever you feel a little down, whenever you feel a little lonely, come take shelter here with Paper Kawaii.

Sometimes you need to cut paper to make sure you have to right shape. If you\\'re doing that, which is this case, it\\'s still origami. This is basically cutting the paper in half not because it\\'s part of the project, just so you can separate the pieces of paper since they\\'re models of their own now. I will do this You are a prefect origamer 🤗🤗 Incredible This is not about the video (though I have enjoyed using many of your videos). It\\'s about your website. It will not load in any browser that I use. I used to be able to visit it, but now, no matter what I do, what I install and try, ALL I GET IS BLANK WHTE. Something about the site has to have changed. I\\'ve even tried switching computers. Same thing. The shop works, but not the main site. I\\'ve seen it with other sites from time to time, and I know other people have had the same problem.

       " 'Ellen is that good friend that makes sure their quiet friend is always involved in the conversation memeimfurst I wish I had a friend like that, I’m mostly the one that always takes cares of my friends and makes sure there also getting attention 🙂 Agreed, although it might not be about being good friend but good host. I mean this is television we\\'re talking about, there\\'s no really place for awkwardness so Ellen was in fact trying to involve Jen but the mistake I think was on the girl, she kind of completely ignored Jen so instead of being a great segment, it is good but kind of awkward. Sandy Simon bruh she’s Jennifer Aniston. Everyone loves her whether she’s talking or not True, although didn\\'t seem to me that Jennifer Aniston really could do much in this segment and best she was quiet rather than attempting to grab any spotlight with what may have been inane commentary on her part 😕. She probably shouldn\\'t have even been included in this piece in the first place 🤷 Rightey! U noticed tht too, ey? She is very considerate of n sensitive twds her ppl arnd her. 😘 I\\'m watching this..Just cause there\\'s Jennifer Aniston Same PARTH GANVIR me yoo Same Same Same The faces Jen makes during this segment are great . @THE BOSS You need glasses, Jennifer was not rude at all Honestly Ayesha didn’t talk to Jen or direct the convo to her . She barely looks at her .Also she doesn’t just stand in the middle she’s literally just right on top of Ellen . Ellen is the one that tries to include Jen . passive aggressiveness is not great i found it tacky It was kinda a strange. Not sure if she felt awkward, throwing shade, trying to be funny, or... Jenn is like me when my friend invites her friend who i dont know and starts being awkward. Girrrrl, me too.  Me too.  Hashtag, me too. I think that Ayesha could have paid a little more attention to Jennifer. She’s constantly facing her body towards Ellen and talking to Ellen. By the expressions on Jennifer’s face, Jennifer is probably pretty left out and feeling pretty awkward. Then again, Ayesha is trying to fit in many recipes into 5 minutes and may not be able to converse that much. However, I feel that it would have been a lot better if she could at least make some eye contact with Jennifer. And Ellen did a great job trying to be inclusive. That\\'s so true Its soo awkward how shes only acknowledging ellen, you can tell ellen was trying to get jenn involved.. Jayy Abhdjdjdjd surely :) she should\\'ve at least pay a little attention to beautiful Jenni..she always look only to Ellen as if they are only two people there. good thing Ellen is a good host that she always include Jen. Good friend* I don’t even like cooking shows, but I love watching Jennifer Aniston’s reactions SO MUCH. Sarah M. Ik me to 😂 Sarah M. Me too😂😂 Literally just watching Jen in this. Her reactions are so fun to see 😂 She clearly doesn’t like Jen\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is that even possible \\n\\n\\nShe’s awesome Meanwhile, Jen\\'s dying in the background after one sip lol Cooking/food segments in talk shows are always so awkward cause theyre always rushing to fit everything in It must be hard to both talk and prepare the meal. Btw, I don\\'t care for cilantro. 😀 Stay away from cilantro! It will make you very sick. Please google any cutler what not to do and read the article I mention below for more info.

She get my simpathy. \\nAyesha only put her whole body towards Ellen. While Jenni looks like okay i am pretending that i am exited. \\nIts not a big deal for u..  But not for me... Musica Enthusiast  is not a big deal It\\'s hard to talk to many people at one time and look at everybody the audience and everything I know because I help my mom sell her books because she is an author and something\\'s we have crowds at our stand so we have to speak loud and try to talk and show everybody the book it\\'s harder then it looks ecspecially me because I\\'m shy Stay away from cilantro!

Wish you all the best! lol it\\'s ok I\\'m sure she brought some hundred dollar bills to wipe her tears with \"You haven\\'t cooked since 1996!\"- Ross Geller Jennifer’s faces during this whole video 😂🙈 I think she would appreciate it if they keep it about her and not mention her husband Everytime she does a show or something on TV . William Murnan She never said that. William Murnan she never said that. It is scary how the internet can put words in someones mouth I think she could live with it. She even mentioned her brother in law who was in the picture which was flashed. That’s what marriage does anyways. @alma martinez  not really she has social media her own cookbook show and a deal with CoverGirl she would still be known she is under the radar for many people because they overlook her for her husband but she is successful by her self and known The only reason she\\'s famous is because of who her husband is... Jen\\'s reaction is priceless! She\\'s like watching a magic show 😂 “We should all be married to you.” 😂 Hi random person scrolling down in the comments section! Hope you have a nice day/night! 😊😊😊 ian awe u put this 10 months ago but thank you so much You too 😊 Thank you, likewise! 😊 Thanks and the same to you. Thanks for the nice replies! If Jennifer Aniston the legend herself was standing in front of me Id be freaking out. Same @NYCzora Bruce almighty, we are the Millers , horrible bosses are regarded as some of the funniest movies of this century. How is that forgetful ? @Jill Dewit He has 2 likes on his comment and I have 99. @NYCzora Really? Forgettable? Funny I still remember every movie she\\'s been in. Her movies are still popular. Eric Cartman She\\'s not a legend. She\\'s a mediocre actress who was in a popular TV show and a bunch of forgettable movies i see jen i click abby woodford me- Came to say the same thing! 👍👍💖 Nice video Ayesha Curry and Mila Kunis have the same voice Omg I’m mind blown I just noticed Shut up meg And eyes Injot Nijjar and Meg Griffin too 😂 Look at JENs expressions 😂😜\\n\\n“Typical Rachael Green .. Queen 👸 Rachael” If I was Ayesha I would be \"Oh my god !! I would freak out !! It\\'s Jenn Aniston. I never seen Jennifer look so awkward before 😂 *priceless* Jen’s face when Ayesha says sugar😂 Omggggg yeeees Chucky chuck 0:30 When ? HAHAHA. Jen\\'s face when Ayesha says \"equal parts sugar and water\". Ayesha is doing everything in her power to not make eye contact with Jen 😂 ELLEN kept trying to include Jennifer :-) I just think Ayesha was a little nervous. Please don\\'t touch my nose! Omg... Ayesha\\'s voice reminds me of Mila Kunis\\' voice!!!!! OMG YESS!!! Now that you said it... yeah it does. Ellie Iredale Ikr if she was in Family Guy no one would know the difference yes, she reminds me of Mila but without accent. Ellie Iredale so true ! Felt kinda awkward at times Felt it. Ayesha kept ignoring Jennifer (unintentionally probably), that could be it. Let me  boil some water and give my whole attention to Jenifer Aniston . I’m mexican and I just watched my culture been crushed with that guacamole For a moment I thought Ayesha curry was the dish you guys were cooking 🤣 Hahahahaha Omg am crying Ayesha is dessert!!! Turdle Central hahahaha yaa m like where\\'s the curry 😃 *Not Jen\\'s greatest acting moment.* 😂😂😂😂 Jen just wanna drink. She\\'s like shut up and gimme something to drink. I would have done the same lol. Jenn is so cute. Her facial expressions when Ayesha is talking hahaaha. Jennifer acting interested when this whole thing is so uncomfortable for some reason. i feel so sorry for jen but ellen is so good at involving her💞 Ayesha needs to acknowledge Jennifer. Throughout the whole segment Jennifer is being so cute and trying to get involved and Ayesha right here is making no eye contact! Rude! ayeshas overrated anyways Red Stilletto Shut up @Where the light_Ends exactly!! Um no she doesn\\'t. This isn\\'t the Jennifer Aniston show. This is the Ellen show. Her attention was directed correctly. Ellen was dlingnyhr eight thing by including her in the conversation. Ayesha was there to cook. Give her a break! She definitely acknowledged Jennifer a couple times in this 5 min clip. Jennifer barely said anything at all. The most we got was the \"Woooow\"! When adding the cheese to the guac... I\\'m just here for Jenn💗 Anyone else think Jen seemed annoyed in this segment? mm12345777 yea you can tell she did we should all be married to you ... lol @cynthia martinez she looks like hahaha bearded dude jen gave her the attention she’s been wanting Aww I love Ayesha but I think she was a little nervous 😭 Highly doubt it. *Jen struggling to handle the tequila* \"CHIPS AND GUAC my favorite\" 😂😂😂😂😂 Jenn’s face says “oh that’s potent.”\\nShe has the best facial expressions. \\nWe would like to hear more about Steph’s rituals. You can tell after 20 seconds that Jennifer Aniston has a brilliantly dry sense of humor. This lady could easily do Meg\\'s voice in Family Guy, so so similar Mila Kunis is irreplacable Actually that\\'s so true. Jen and ellen, we can tell the sarcasms hahahah \"chips and guac, an American classic\"  lol ! She\\'s a cook and she\\'s got Curry in her name😂😂😂😂... PERFECT JEN:“We should all be married to you”\\n😂 awww the way she said it lol Chips and guac mexican classic I was just thinking that...not from U.S.A. hon bruh I can’t watch this she wasn’t paying any attention to Jen my queen No one: \\nNot a single soul: \\nAyesha: ThIs Is MY kNiFe FrOm My LiNE You got Jennifer Anniston standing next to you, and this lady doesn\\'t even look at her. Steph could\\'ve done better. Easy now...  In all honesty, I don\\'t think she was being like that towards Jen intentionally.  Ayesha looked pretty nervous - there was a lot going on, and they were pressed for time.  Plus there were times where you could actually see Ayesha\\'s hands visibly shaking.  When in doubt, it is always better to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Love, luck and lollipops!  <3 トイレの花子 she could have been nervous 🤷🏾\\u200d♀️ Did she really say “chips and guac an American classic”\\n\\nWow 🙄🙄🙄 Did she???  I could have SWORN she said, \"Mexican Classic\".... Dang it - now I\\'m gonna have to re-watch it. I really love Jennifer. From Philippines Mobile8 Psr hey ako din haha Jen 25 years ago and Jen now.. I see no difference. OMG IM SO EARLY ON ELLEN HOLLY The fact that the chef mostly talked to Ellen, an payed no attention to Jenny, I could litterly feel how Jen feels, so relatable 😭🥺❤️ She Changed my Life With The Mango Hack 😄❤️ Same ! Guacamole an american classic?! Por favor American classic?? Thats Mexican classic tf I see Jen and Ellen (clicks rapidly)❤️\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI love Jens facial reactions in this video😂🤣 I have this feeling that Jen doesn\\'t quite like Ayesha... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Jen wasn\\'t getting no love from Mrs Curry! I thought jen was a bit standoffish..it seemed uncomfortable for both jen and ayesha, but ayesha had to talk and keep going. This was a very intense 5 mins lol Totally ignoring her. 😟 Jen is like me when my friend had a friend I don\\'t know and im just the quiet one there like.... 1:30 her smile is so pure 🥴😫😍 It’s interesting that they didn’t try any of the food. Only the cocktail. 🤣🤣😍Jennifer’s faces Was it just me or was Jen being just a little bit shady? Hi Ellen, I really like you a lot. Stay healthy as always. Love lots I’m only watching this to see how Jenifer Aniston would pronounce my name 2:14 Lol it looks like Jen didn\\'t even taste it 😂 Well this was awkward lol i really like how the three things ayesha made are perfect for summer and so quick and easy to prepare :) also guys, don\\'t say she was ignoring anyone. she had a certain amount of time allocated for her segment; the point of it was to demonstrate cooking, not chat with jennifer. Jen is so cute my heart can’t handle it I want one that can cook like her🤩🤩 5:08 Her response is priceless.😘 if i ever had the chance to hug jen, i would never let go. “We should all be married to you” Jen’s facial expressions are the best thing of this video. She’s so incredibly cute JENNIFER ANISTON LOOK TO PRETTY HERE ELLEN TODAY !!! Who\\'s better cook\\n1.Monica\\n2.ayesha curry Monica The answer will always be Monica Monica! MONICA ! monica ofc Yooooo!! You dont add Garlic to Guacamole.

Hah. That is exactly the reason why the world hates China. You realize you guys only have money because you are the sweatshop of the world. Wait until those orders start going to India or South America then you won’t be so cocky about having such low wages. China will go down down down until you’re nothing but a memory, a bad memory. @KealiiWet markets? Yeah,I know what it is, also, when you say \"the world is coming for china,\" please rephrase it to \"The Magats are coming for China\" @phayke, Have you heard the tale of the pandemic of 2002? Well if not I’ll give you the highlights, a Coronavirus originating from wild animals jumped to humans from a market that sells them. Hundreds of people died globally. China was aware of the risks of these markets but reopened them regardless. You are at fault when you make the same mistake multiple times. The world is coming for China. @Kealii Yeah, but America\\'s misactions are not to be blamed on anyone else. And, yes, preventing the virus, it\\'s not that easy... You can\\'t just prevent something as infectious as Coroanvirus... I\\'m pretty sure that if the virus had originated in Chicago or something they would have been a hell worse than China.

But though I do agree that 5G is bad for our health BUT it has nothing to do with it. What about Avril Lavigne is actually dead?!

Everything that came from china is propaganda. You see how brainwashed u guys are? They started the virus. While we only have gen3 version. Meanwhile Murrica got all of them. Weird eh There is another video saying china had another outbreak. Trogdor Trogdor What I read is that in Shuifenhe, a small town bordering Russia , tested 243 cases from Russia and Chinese gov took it seriously . All the visitors entering have been quarantined. They are also building a mobile hospital in advance. That is not likely to be called a wave.

Chinese doctors first reported cases of pneumonia of unknown causes on December 27 to the Chinese District CDC. An investigation immediately started. WHO was notified on December 31.

       " 'Not gonna lie, the fact that it took about 10 minutes to get into the \"how\" part made me more angry Oh yes i feel the same. I guess she wanted to remind us how to notice being angry feels like 🤣 Hi More like 12:21 @Cucumzebrillionthe fact that your comment makes me angry- I live in a prison of rage. Pray for me to be freed! I\\'ve managed to suppress my anger for 12 years should I let it out now @steven oliver I\\'m not even religious nor do I pray much but \"I don\\'t know you so \"\"can\\'t\"\" pray for you.\" Is an awful thing to say. You should leave the prayers to people who do care. @steven oliver God bless u but we don\\'t need to know the person to pray for them we are all love all one on same journey in. Life I\\'ll pray for him God bless u I feel same so many harmed me thru out my life I\\'m so angry inside at those who destroyed my life going to start journaling to see will that help release the anger @DON ROGERS bless your heart and thank you so much! 1.25x speed... is the best option to reduce your anger!!! this is impatience not anger It sounds like she’s talking on a reality TV show at that speed. 1.5x always I do it with every single video 😂 their speaking speeds make me really angry Sumit Paul 4X for me :) \"Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die\" \\n– Buddha. @Red Glory Nosce te ipsum.

The fact that you\\'re here shows that you want to act on it, and the advice of others has failed for you. Listening to her story is not useless, because she provides the context to understand what she then says. If you really want to change your relationship with anger, please open your ears and not leave an angry comment and leave. That only hurts you. Thank you for this comment. I think that a lot of people that are refusing to deal with their anger need to hear this. Or they and the people around them just need to accept that they really don\\'t want to get better. @DON ROGERS Yes, that was very insightful, thank you so much! \\nAbout your vision, I think that thay it is true that you\\'re an instrument of delivery to some rrelief, but I think angry people wouldn\\'t do that on purpose. When it is channeled like that, unconciously.\\nI used to be someone who would never get angry, just profoundly sad. When I learned to heal the expressing channel of anger, I seemed to get angry at many things which I wasn\\'t able to change, or small details or meaningless things that happened and I became overwhelmed by it very easily.\\n It seems like it\\'s easy to reach the extreme, but never the center, and that\\'s what I\\'m trying to move towards slowly @Andrea Albert   Sometimes people live in a silent rage that has no trigger and no purpose - other than to alleviate the inner storm that races through their mind.  \\nNo matter what you do - no matter what you say or how much you plead - and no matter how much you know - or learn - nothing will halt or hinder the raging torment that blasts from the minds of some angry people.\\nIt\\'s never you when a narcissist - or someone with an unsolvable inner issue - lets their inner rage loose on those around them. \\nThey\\'re simply taking a drug - a narcotic - and it\\'s called anger.  \\nThey inject it - smoke it - or snort it - using you as the instrument of delivery.  \\nThey\\'re not concerned with you at all - they simply need a hit of rage - and your the one that provides it.  \\nThey aren\\'t always bad people - and they aren\\'t always good people.\\nThey are just people consumed with the need for anger in order to release the unseen pressures they can\\'t deal with. I believe she is responding to some people who lacked the wisdom to understand the greater depths of what was being expressed in the video.   \\nI don\\'t believe this video was meant for shallow people or for those terminally unhappy.  \\nIt is more geared to help those motivated to know the truths behind angry people, and for those who have been adversely affected by them. \\nSome thoughtless folks made mention of video being less interesting than they should have.  \\nFor any intelligent and mindful person looking to make the world a better place - this video was invaluable.  \\nA lot of good thinking and ideas went into the teaching she\\'s presented. Thank you for saying it. Ppl are impatient. But the context to anger is the most important part. I’m definitely more of an erupter, I feel like this wasn’t for me @Aniruddha Keskar I think it could also stem from a need for justice. Over the years, I\\'ve been jaded by people\\'s duplicitous nature, everyone taking advantage of you or nice people  and by just the world in general. I\\'m becoming less and less tolerant and sometimes more and more irritable and angry. I don\\'t think ego is necessarily the root of it. This video is categorically not aimed at erupters -  it\\'s aimed at those who rise above us... or something... @MonteCristo this is me. It\\'s a thing? The older i get, the worse it gets. Im starting to feel hopeless @Aniruddha Keskar Like folks who suppress anger tend to be people-pleasers? The main problem with us is our egoistic thinking patterns that need to be changed \"anger reveals boundaries. Anger heals trauma. Anger inspires action. Crystal anger puts others in icu. And me in front of a judge. @kept hahaha well said true this. anger inspires me to hit a wall not to act rationally... Breath.\\nName it.\\nDo it differently.\\nInquire. This is applied to people who know how to control their anger Thank you! i believe that this is what a person who is cool with all his emotions and know he is not them does Naturally. With some intention we can all get there. First of all, it\\'s OKAY to be angry, don\\'t ever let anyone tell you \"you shouldn\\'t be mad\" about something. The main takeaways are that 1) ANGER, like all emotions, is COMMUNICATION - it creates a physiological reaction to tell you something is wrong. If you can acknowledge in your own body what happens, then you\\'re a step closer to getting back in the driver\\'s seat; 2) ANGER IS YOUR ALLY; it doesn\\'t hesitate to tell you that either your boundaries have been crossed or something is wrong/unjust; 3) ANGER CANNOT BE CONTROLLED OR IGNORED! It persists until you do something about the situation that caused it. Emotions occur in your body, YOU are not emotions; think of them as friends coming to visit you, although you may not always appreciate their visitation, they usually have something very important to tell you. One thing this woman failed to mention is that THIS IS NOT EASY, it takes many many times going through these sort of steps (breathing, naming, etc.) before you are able to become friends with your anger rather than resorting to old habits (so have some compassion for yourself, it\\'ll take time). The greatest advice I\\'ve been given regards all emotions: allow them in, let yourself feel every part of it, don\\'t judge them or yourself, don\\'t react on them, ask them what is it that\\'s causing the commotion, and trust that deep down you know the answer. If anything you will gain more understanding about yourself. And please remember that if you turn your back on your emotions, you\\'re only turning your back on yourself, which is the greatest mistake you could make. Thank you. Agreed, thank you for this comment Well said, thank you Anger is a warning that I\\'m about to act or speak in a way that I\\'ll regret. My anger is focused at people and things out of my reach and control. Not sure how to remedy that without becoming an assassin of the 1%. Join the assassins\\' guild today! @Caio LopesI went Vegan 4 years ago. Eating meat every day with every meal is the single most destructive thing the average person can do to the environment. I\\'v done what I can. As for Eco system restoration I live in the Welsh valleys. 2 ft beneath the soil is poisonous coal slag. and above that vast, dead mono culture imported Pine forestrys. If you can get the English to acknowledge their legacies on my country and their continued self priority in running it. Then I\\'l deal with the eco system up here. but until those blood drenched freeloader come clean. nothing will change. Perhaps going with the flow of life - knowing this is your reality for the present time?   \\nI\\'ve been trying to accept certain issues as realities that I can\\'t change.\\nThings maybe I must allow - but try to ignore - as if they\\'re only a fruit fly on the other side of the room.   (I think that was in this video - but maybe not). \\nI\\'m finding more and more that the perception I have of myself is the real reason the actions of a few others have a devastating effect on my thinking (and life).  \\nWhy should I put any value in the words and actions of others who don\\'t live in MY head?  \\nIf they are not physically attacking me - then they have no true power over me - except what I allow them to have.  \\nSomething like that - anyway.  \\nThis video was great for me.  I got to ask my anger and aggravations who they were and what they were here for.  It was a very eye-opening experience.\\nHousebound during COVID  - trying to learn things.   lol Dawson Davis me too, and I just can’t let go. I’d scream at the top of my lungs right now if I wouldn’t wake people. try to redirect all your energy into ecossystem restoration. there are some options which are economic viable and you can go 100% on the dirt hehe AWESOME. when in a rage, you have to do these steps SO FAST, right in the moment or you get owned. Breathe (regain balance);  \"Name it\"/feel it/hear it -  gives respect to your anger, it then will answer, & if you listen, you can choose to give it what it wants...which will be something opposite of the desire to destroy.   Anger even rage are like the rites of passage to compassion, forgiveness, repentance (change) peace, understanding, Love.  GREAT, if people will practice, this goes to the core & heart of the matter, the relief & resolution you are seeking. this video brought me to tears. it gave me the answer I\\'ve been looking for for 20 helpless years... i can\\'t believe i finally have the tools to process the anger that\\'s been progressively ruining my life. (didn\\'t have the tools to go to therapy or seek help.) thank you so much for this talk, i literally can\\'t thank you enough. So glad it was helpful for you.

My grandpa beat my dad his whole life so no surprise as my dad also beat me growing up too. (Im sure I deserved some of them but not all). I come from a family of anger and i am no better. My son doesn\\'t have to worry about me striking him as I never have and will never but having him see me upset all the time isn\\'t any better. Am i doomed to always be this way or does anyone ever really change? I don\\'t think you can ever be a perfect parent. But what I really missed from my dad is being able to talk about what made him the way he is, what happens in the moments when he acts like that and to be able to share the struggle in dealing with emotions and learning from each other and past mistakes.  The only way to break the cycle is to be honest and share the struggle. If you let your child see you they will learn being flawed is ok, and that\\'s such an important lesson! Honesty about painful things can only bring you closer. Good luck! Do seek professional help. We need proper guidance to be better Same Feel you mate, realizing your problem is the first step towards fixing it I would say. She\\'s just a good story teller. I\\'d like to look at her in a traffic jam after a hard day. To control your own anger is the hardest thing ever to everyone. I think her point is (and she talks about it in her story) that she\\'s been always repressing it, and the solution is not about not feeling angry, but listening to it and making it an ally to fight for whatever changes may be done.

I can\\'t say I am successful at this every time, but at least I knew what I should be doing instead I almost want to rewatch this. It hit home for sure. Love it. I used to be anger stuff, but no more. Very educational and intelligent. Thank you for the insight. Words of Wisdom to share! Loved This, It really helped me. Had to listen to this one again. It was really helpful for me.🙏👍❤ So glad it resonated Carolina, thank you I wish I had heard this years ago. Hearing her story in the beginning was healing, because I know exactly how every bit of that felt. Someone else has been through what I have been through. omg... this exactly where I am at with my life at this moment. I don\\'t comment much, but this is deep. Thank you. Felt like someone was telling my story. 12:21\\n\\nWhat you came for. You’re welcome. For the first time, I spoke to my anger.  In just minutes while pausing this video - I learned my anger was given to me just as my flesh and bones were, from my parents.  \\nMy father was a very angry man (unable to accept some war-related horrors)- and thanks to this video - I know he passed a twisted understanding of who I am, off to me, along with his anger in life.  \\nThe video was very eye-opening for me.  I\\'m excited about the prospect of learning to make anger an ally instead of a toy for the echoes of my youth.  Good Video. Yes brother, wisdom is justified of her children. Keep looking up, He\\'s coming suddenly. John 14:6 \\nKing Jesus 👑 Powerful, thanks for sharing Don. Very captivating and educating. Thank you, great work Keep them coming ;-) 7:23 Reminds me Al Pacino\\'s speech in Scent of a Woman According to abraham twerski write an anger journal. Look for that youtube video Thank you for such an insightful talk. This is so true 👍\\nIn my last video I spoke about strategies to manage your anger\\nAnger if not managed appropriately can put full stop in your life ✋\\nKeep sharing such videos ❤️ So glad it resonated, thank you Life and Learning. Thank you..After 10 months of going down the list of addictions and emotions that I needed to address to improve my life , I finally got to Anger. I realized now , that I should have started with this one. I called it that she was gonna say \\'I saw myself\\' The fact that I’m even on this channel... smh She has such a soothing voice😍 I appreciate this content and speaker. Need this at this point of time as my body is feeling the symptoms - stomach pain, back pain, neck pain, migrain. Screen of my cellpone was broked because of my anger when I was play that Mobile legends Thanks for this information. I am going to apply these tools. I really appreciated this message, and its simple and powerful presentation . \\n\\nThat\\'s not the way to make a fist, though, you can break your thumb! But its not for punching. Only presentational I\\'ve lost about 100$ for my anger problems breaking glasses etc lol Brilliant, wise, funny, and touching! Juna is pioneering the world of mindful anger. Love how she invites us to befriend our anger and use it for true good! Thanks for recommending this video! It wasn\\'t what I expected and exactly what I needed! Really helpful talk! i clean the whole house when i got angry, sometime my manipulative and lazy husband use it as a tool to just CLEAN the whole bunch of latenight beer bottles Amazing. Thank you. Can it be that I just saw you, Juna Mustad, breathe by lifting your shoulders and filling your chest and not your stomach with air??? Omg that made me cry. Well delivered. Thank you Wow! This was awesome! Amazing! Thank you for share this! Well im an anger erupter and i seriosuly hate that feeling and my thougts when im angry i tried to stop it and i was able to control it for 2 days but then i exploded i started shaking and everything was blurry in front of my eyes its really hard to control it but again we can learn to do it but i dont think its possible to stop feeling it and thats the worst thing i hate when im angry i just really cant control i just want to punch something so hard till my hand starts to bleed and i seriously dont know what to do anymore its just building inside of me and it seems that i cant control it very well i literally almost got a heart attack because of how angry i was, pls can someone give me some good advice cuz i just want to change it but it seems that nothing helps 😕 I just erupted last night, I feel you .. something we have to overcome 😢 This is glorious, been searching for \"what are the stages of anger?\" for a while now, and I think this has helped. You ever tried - Meyaarn Unprecedented Magic - (Have a quick look on google cant remember the place now ) ? It is a smashing exclusive guide for discovering how to get rid of your anger issues without the normal expense. Ive heard some amazing things about it and my friend got great results with it. The lack of a letter “R” in her second name angers me This makes me laugh... thank you. They used to call me Juna Mustard in school  ;) Thank you, it helped a lot. Best speech that I heard of on ted im good i can feel her angry thru the screen im out she got too much stress going on with her life! lmao im out! lmao I\\'ll give my best kindness to anyone but when they start showing their attitude I burst out my anger. My story; Born in a violent household, violated by my parents 24 years, Married another abusive/controlling husband, rejected by my three children for divorcing my toxic ex. Violated by my ex 13 years after the divorce. These experience has made me hid my true feelings, I do anger internally within myself, but outside of myself I don\\'t. If someone upset me I write them as I don\\'t cope with confrontation as I afraid of being hit, this is from decades of violence I was tortured by. So My internal anger is justifiable and not poison like these people that have commented here. Bad parents cause the issue that why adults turn into horrible people or withdrawn like me.  There are about millions of adults who have been abused in childhood then never had a voice and even now these scars never heal. I just feel if you were her boyfriend and cheated on her she has that vibe of one that would slash your tires, burn your house down, and stalk you till she is arrested 🤣 I remember in elementary school I had a way to deal with anger or being angry at someone to be specific.\\n\\nI\\'d say it\\'s a somewhat healthy way rather than punching someone.\\nI remember if someone made me mad, I\\'d draw them tied up in chains crying, their mouth glued with hot glue and then taped with duct tape.\\nA bit psychopathic for a 10-year-old, but at least no one got hurt music too loud, speech too soft. Great Ted Talk. Currently in an anger management class and this was a great listen to compare with my notes! I\\'ve flipped my amygdala thing all over my shoes, but only because I\\'m happy, not angry.  Excellent presentation of important info. Appreciate it My entire life I was a stuffer.  Then in my 40s I turned into an erupter.  I’m 48 now. Listening to find that middle ground:) Messed up big time and trying to change things. Now I wonder if my acid reflux, arthritis and back pain might be linked to this. Check out Dr Sarno\\'s books- the divided mind, the mindbody connection etc Omg I hope my girl dosint do that When I get angry I never hurt anyone, I just let it put quietly or start doing physical work twice the speed I usually do. Anger is energy, whether you use it for good or bad depends on you 4:46 is that a sneeze?! Yep, someone sneezed in the audience ;) the volume on this video needs to be turned UP Women cleaning the toilet with husband toothbrush: laughter\\n\\nMan hits something with fist after fighting: he\\'s literally a murderer at this stage Im only angry when im provoked\\n\\nSome say its because im 29 ArE yOu BrEaThInG?

       " 'Bravo Bravo!!!.\\n It took years to really understand this, you made it so easy. there\\'s a saying \"there are no bad students, only bad teachers\" you proved it man.\\n It was very helpful for my. Finally I get it! Thank you Thanks very much for the encouraging feedback!  I\\'m very glad these videos have been helpful to you.\\nDerek Owens\\n @Derek Owens Could you tell me other applications like this. An application that we can draw while explaining it at thr same time.. thanks extremely clear +1 subscribed\\ndiagrams make things a LOT easier to understand\\n\\n\\nCould i ask you what software are you using for those drawings? Simply Wonderfull explaination @idster7  Yes, that\\'s right.  If you think in terms of electron flow, then the left hand rule applies instead of the right hand rule.  This difference is, unfortunately, somewhat confusing, has been an endless source of confusion to physics students for the past century. Thanks, man.  Love all you folks, too. Your drawing is damn good I have a tablet (yes, it\\'s a Bamboo) and I use some screen capture software, and I have a pretty good microphone.  The hardest part was getting used to lecturing with no students in the room! wow incredible drawing gift what device do you use to draw like that? great vid..thx bro! Thankyou so much, I\\'m doing GCSE physics and my teacher, although good most of the time, didn\\'t explain electromagnetism to us very well at all, I need to understand something to remember it so I struggled to remember all this but then I found your video and I understand how it works so I can apply this to the exam, thats the way my brain works, cant memorize well but if I understand a set of rules I can use them to work out the answer for myself in my mind. Thanks much, its more interesting than I thought too. Gugglewolf I\\'m 12 and doing this I love youre videos Derek. I\\'ve been reading a book about basice electronics and when I dont understand something I watch youre videos! Watching in 2019, still find it a very nice explanation! The first minute cleared up a misunderstanding I have had for a year now, thank you! Nice drawing The difference between the electric field and the magnetic field is 90 degrees.  :)  Seriously, as they are directional in nature, they are usually different by 90 degrees.  Also a magnetic field is only present if there is charge in motion.  An electric field is present if there is charge, period.  But you are right that they are related.  In fact, they are usually thought of as both being manifestations of the same theory, electromagnetism. @BrydonBear  Thanks!  And yes, that\\'s correct.  Current is the flow of charge through a wire.  Specifically charge is measured in Coulombs, and current tells us the amount of charge that flows past a point in a given time.  One Coulomb of charge per second is 1 Ampere, or 1 Amp, or current.  Current flow is usually electrons flowing, but any charged particle moving would be called electric current. @BrydonBear  Yes, yes, and yes.  Correct on all points. this is so great! thank you Very clear ideas, thank you sir THANK YOU THANK YOU! wonderful man. thanks a lot. what program do you use to draw this stuff, and do you use a bambo draw pad, or do you draw strait onto the monitor? I\\'d like to thank you wholeheartedly for all your valuable contribution. I learn a lot from your videos and I am very grateful. THANK YOU SO MUCH! @hc1vi   Yes, you may use this in your classroom.  I hope your students learn a lot!\\nD.O.\\n Thanks I’ve credit Derek Owens on my twitter and linkedin I’m a conceptual inventor and his video gave me some information i did not know. I’m working on a free perpetual motion concept however his credit is also towards the gravity telescope concept :) HELP: Hey I was just wondering how I would go about making a coil that would play a frequency through the middle of it. If it is done the same way, I have no idea as this isnt my area however I have an experiment to conduct and would like help Thanks for the videos! :) Save us a lot trouble when we miss classes. thanks for this video!!! perfect thank you :) very well explained, thank you. excuse me, \\nWhy the metal nail enhences the magnetic field? I am curious to know ! \\n\\n\\nthanks ! same doubt for me the wire cant be bare copper. it must be insulated (with enamel) or the charge will short across the coil rather than through it. very well done! easy to follow. thanks a lot Thank you so much for helping us. Derek! Wish you luck. @ourtrashcans Oh, right, I see what you\\'re saying, and that\\'s a good point.  The electric and magnetic fields really work together, but that\\'s beyond the scope of this course.  I would love to dig into that more, though, and make some videos on that also at some point.  When I get some free time.... I\\'m trying to do a science fair project on electricity. And I have no clue how i am going to do it. And i only have two weeks. Can you explain it to me in a easier way! I\\'m trying to make a electro magnect. And i need help understanding how the wire works. What is the point you want to convey about electricity in the project? Thank you so much!! video was so helpful. I really appreciate wonderful videos like yours Great job Mr. Owens. Many thanks. Thank you! Very nice demonstration. Just out of curiosity, how do you make all these nice drawings? Is it a program that you use? Very helpful, thank you. This video was really helpful. Thanks! I love the font!....on and the lesson is great. Thanks!  hi derek... its awesome..from where u hv lernt all this things. rigt nw i m very clr wid this. thank you. please upload some more videos... \\xa0 indeed an enjoyable video, well presented! Also nice graphics and\\ufeff handwriting!\\nWhat software and device do u use for this. great explanations !!! Thanks thank you! The wire around the nail would be shielded or naked (raw copper whatever)?\\nHope you get what i meant. Thanks, Man Derek You\\'re quite an artist I have an exam tomorrow, you saved my life. Brilliant explanation bro You also need to know which rule to use ahead of time. For electron flow theory you would use the left hand rule. When I went through B-Double-E school at Great Lakes NTC, we used electron flow theory. Then, on to Chanute AFB, we continued to use electron flow theory. Love this , helped understand a lot Nice ! Smart stuff on the internet , Id rather look at that instead of ex: singner\\'s\\n I think magnetic field flows from north to south ..whereas here in this video ..the case is reverse.. God bless your soul Nice drawings and great explanation. What software or stylus or tablet do you use? I\\'ve bought two and I can\\'t control the point in which I\\'m going to draw on the screen. Yes, that is correct as far as I understand the matter.  And it makes sense, too:  Positive charge flowing one direction is mathematically equivalent to negative charge flowing the opposite direction. That\\'s correct.  The distinction between conventional current and electron flow is a never ending source of confusion for physics students. Thank you so much your a great teacher. Simple explanation Thumbs up thank you I use powerful ac and dc coils to magnetize and inspect steel parts to look for flaws and cracks.And a VERY powerful 200lb ac coil to de-magnetize parts. mr derek knows how to draw what he\\'s thinking asap man I like your drawing its pretty neat. After studied four years of hardcore engineering in electronics and communication. \\xa0 I always stuck why a piece of iron or something put middle of the inductor.I couldn\\'t understand in my engineering days.thank you Derek........... what happens if you use coated copper wire instead of bare copper wire? (how does it effect the magnetic field) How would one contain plasma in a magnetic field? Plasma is nothing but the Electrons+Ions & as we know the eletrons can be grabed & placed where you want (normally in potential well it is placed) using high magnetic field. \\nWhile working with plasma there is one concept of magnetron target (Search-Plasma Sputtering systems or Magnetron target), Where high magnitude magnetic field lines acts as a double convex lens. This Double convex lens grabs or focuses the electrons/ions of Plasma just like a ray of light. thanks daddy derek current = charge flow. current flow = charge flow flow.\\ncurrent doesn\\'t flow, charge flows, sorry just bugs me a little bit, thanks for the good video and clear explanation Nice vid Mr.Owens, very helpfull. I hear you.  By convention I assume you mean conventional current flow.  Probably the most consistently confusing issue to physics students, for the past two centuries.  I try to explain both, by the way, so my students will understand the source of the confusion. Thank you, this was very well explained, however there is a huge mistake that you should note: The voltage has nothing to do with the coil heating up, it\\'s all about the current.\\nThe current flows, the voltage applies.\\xa0\\n\\nYou could melt a coil using 1V and 1000A, however putting 1000V on a wire is pretty common and wouldn\\'t damage the coil unless not insulated. That\\'s right ;) @Swiss Experiments - Castagnola007 Sounds good!\\xa0 One other thing, though.\\xa0 Even though P = I²R, you can not increase R with constant I.\\xa0 There is a cause and effect that takes place.\\xa0 Increasing R will *cause* a decrease in I.\\xa0 In order to increase R and keep a constant I, you would have to also increase V. @Derek Owens\\xa0I could agree with you, however, if you look at the power as in P = V^2/R or P = I^2*R, given R = 2, if you increase V, you get a certain power, however if you increase I, you get more power. And if you increase the R, you\\'ll see that as R tends to infinity, given any V, P will be equal to 0, whilst, given any I, P will be infinity.\\n\\nBut yeah, too many factors should be considered, like the real Resistance of the wire, the power supply, the internal resistance and so on. Theoretically if the wire is a 0 ohm wire, then the currently flowing would be infinity and the power too.\\n\\nLet\\'s just say we\\'re both right ;) Right, although I believe\\xa0I would say that it is about *both* the voltage and the current.\\xa0 Heat is energy, and Power is energy over time.\\xa0 The Power is current times voltage.\\xa0 The current and the voltage both contribute to the heat, and they do so equally. Thank u sooooo much !!! When you wrap the iron nail with wire to make the coil, does the wire have to be insulated or can it be exposed? @derekowens \\r\\nCopy that.... & Thanks you. Oh my god, your drawing is incredible. Great job. Positive goes to the power and uses the power. Negative is fed the power. Think about it. Great, short explanation. Quality is also really good for a 9 year old video Hi there, I must say I liked your video lecture! Blue and yellow colors somehow do attracts me to your notes longer. And I liked the example of every applications that you gave for every principle you were trying to explain! That makes me understand better! Great job! =) Good and clear explanation. Thank you! But how does right Hand rule work?what caused the yellow circle around ửies? Very nicely done, drawings too. What\\'s your thoughts on the magnetic field actually being magnetic particles? ? but why exactly having an ion in the middle make the field stronger? well look, current flow implies motion of particles. Such a motion is bound to create some effect. (think in terms of conservation of mass and energy). This effect might be magnetism. I in no way claim that my answer is accurate. Just a try to satisfy my own curiosity :D. I\\'d be glad if someone provides a definite answer\\n so weird how we know so much about electrons and magnetic forces, but we actually know next to nothing about how or why they act this way\\nanyone knows of an experiment that simulates the earth\\'s magnetic field by using liquid melted metal as the source of the field?\\n\\nedit: nvm found it myself, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAYW9n8i-C4 u explain really well.... Thanks a lot =) your videos are very very helpful!! better than the book, and  much better than any of the physics teachers that had taught me !!! George Bush, is that you?\\n brilliant !! Your Tutorials are Awesome! very nice vid! what software did u use? hay just a question here ?  The magnetic field is constant then when one electron current goes to start to finish right ?? Thanks for the response and I do prologize for the seemingly frustrated tone. There are things that just erk me about our educational systems. Like how half our science text books are filled with unnecessary information. Get to the meat I say.   :) Great vid Since the Earth also has an iron centre is that the reason that it’s electromagnetic field is so strong? \\n\\nIf so is there some sort of copper in the earth? To do the same thing the wire is doing here? You are a beautiful man... I say that in the most heterosexual way possible :) 10:01 Your battery is backward:) So what causes a current in a wire to produce a magnetic field? I was always told about the effects of the magnetic field and its sources, but never what actually causes it. what program are you using to do this? thank u very much or this marvelous explaining .. as to direction of current flow wether from +ve pole ( conventional current ) or -ve pole ( electrons ) , i think it is the same \" theoretically \", but actually - as u said - current flows from -ve pole  ( electrons ) im responding to this msg just to ask you a question ... what dos affect the power of the electromagnet ? is it the voltage, the amps ... ?  im making a coilgun and i need this info to make one has efficient has possible thanks ! ps sorry for my bad english im its my 3rd language Great video. I\\'m trying to calculate the induced current of a cylindrical magnet moving through a wire coil, but I\\'m too lazy to read through my old text. Can you give me (or point me in the direction) the formula? ',\n",

Chemistry attracts our curiosity 🤓🤓 chemistry teachers: right that down! right that down! I\\'ve done that dancing flame experiment in the laboratory Το σχολειο μου δεν κανει τιποτα τετοιο:( Amazing this is why I am a chemistry lover . in my physical science class we did a few things like this, one of them being placing dry ice in some water and watching it turn colors. chemistry can be all kinds of fun Science is meant and derived from actual observations and demonstrations, theory was never meant be the base of science, pseudoscience is when you just start making theories up basically from speculation of equations or Fabrication\\'s to fit a narrative for unexplainable observations.... I think it goes both ways. I mean if all those mind bending theories about quantum mechanics weren\\'t proposed then we still wouldn\\'t be able to explain how microwaves work. But by theoretical science, if you\\'re talking about the sloppy education system that teaches us science by memorization only then yes, I agree with you 100% on that. Casy Leer that makes me feel good. So much love and passion for Chemistry really makes me happy.😀 My favourite subject CHEMISTRY Me too YESS 🙄🙄🙄 ishrat ansari me toooooooo😍 hah wow we share same name...and guess what...? im the student of chemistry (major sub)...dreaming of being a chemist soon:) This is the best way of learning chemistry by fun and practical. This makes the subject look so easy. We can use the alchol  experiment to power neuclear centrifuges. In our school days, we learned chemistry just to by heart the formulae and pass in written examinations. We of course did a few simple practicals. It may be due to our lack of resources in our region. I very much understand. But that kind of learning isn\\'t chemistry and isn\\'t enough.\\nBut what we see here is real chemistry. +1 για τους Έλληνες. Well done Greece ❤️ I Wish my prof was like that...

FLAMMY *h3h3 intro starts playing* Yo papa flammy If news and updates about the pandemic were delivered in her voice, I don\\'t think anyone *could* panic. It\\'s just so calming. So true. She\\'s the female Joe Pera She should do one over the stats of the virus spread. I imagine that this is what angels sound like Well said Some go to sleep with white noise, others the sound of rain. I listen to Tibees talking about neural networks. Yessssssss I\\'m doing the same. and dream about electronic sheeps Yes so true! Food for thought.. Also try Isaac Arthur\\'s channel on Science and Futurism this is ASMR petef15 literally doing this rn 11:55 a neuron doesn\\'t understand grams or centimeters\\nNeural networks use imperial units confirmed I\\'m afraid I can\\'t let you make me believe that. @William Oh, cool! That explains it I guess. Am a bit sad that the English language is in such shambles. I specifically like it because it gives me 4x the vocab, instead of making weird compound words strung together like we do in Danish. I suppose you\\'re right about the sophistry stuff, but hey.. If you plan to work in mainstream media I guess it gives you the right skillset? ಠ_ಠ\\r\\nAs for the Nordics - Mixed I\\'d say! Sweden - Broken. Norway - Oil money don\\'t care. Denmark\\'s doing slightly better I\\'d say, but the Finns, Faroese and Icelanders are probably the best at preserving their cultural heritage from what I\\'ve seen. @William Ps. Can I just ask.. Who in the world are you to know things like this, if you\\'re not on some sort of debate team? Philosophy devotee, or maybe a literature guy? I\\'m a Danish speaker from Denmark, and I\\'m (apparently) excessively verbose compared to most native speakers I talk to. DARN IT ! @William thx 4 learnings my dude, will retain the word \"enthymeme\", iz useful I genuinely believe you are one of the most inviting educational Youtube channels on the platform. Thank you. Thanks to you I\\'m at an interesting point where procrastination has come full circle and turned back into learning maybe it is the point where you realize you can learn while having fun and are not forcing yourself. When the title says \"Neural Networks and Chill\", but since it\\'s your own field it gives you anxiety I had a nightmare were zombies were chasing me and it was cause my nuetral net was buggy Oh! Your voice is so satisfying and relaxing 💆 you make the mathematics relaxing and enjoying \\nLove your videos Tibees ✨🌙 Thanks for the bedtime story. Now I\\'m gonna dream about the tensor flow library. Tibees if you posted a video of yourself reading a phone book, I would watch it. Your voice is so calming. Keep up the great content. 👍 5:59\\n[Halfway through drawing something]\\nNeural Network: I know it\\'s a 5.\\n[Completes drawing 5]\\nNeural Network: You know what? I think it\\'s a 2. loool Perfect watching for a relaxing afternoon in self-isolation. I\\'ve been interested in applying neural networks for some software at our lab in Melbourne so this was great timing thank you. Book recomendation: Neural netwoks and learning machines by Simon Haykin Damn you are so well-behaved and Calm. I wish I were as chill as you. @John Lime about neural network, apparently. well, that one which are not messed up Wait, are you talking about Toby or the cat? Ok Well-behaved? @KJ Wolfe I blame my parents for my fucked up upbringing. my neurons have branched into inter-dimensional realms just looking at u @SlyFox virgin @antony Pizarro incel Simp This was a pretty great run through of some of the concepts related to artificial neural networks. Thanks! my god a subscription to brilliant is my absolute dream but it\\'s so expensive :( I developed an interest in ML and data science 2 months ago. Yesterday I finished a 1-month course on neural networks.\\nAnd today, you uploaded this video. What a coincidence! Hey .. I am from 🇮🇳 and I m regular viewer of yours ! You content I really awsm. Stay safe ..... Cool girl ❤️ Nhi degi Thank you, Toby, for interesting story telling! God is Good and you are lovely! And happy math day from Russia! wow so many creeps on this comment section.\\n\\n\\nPD: I was amazed of the graphic that showed the understanding of the machine of what makes a number different. great video You look exactly like my mom when she was at your age LOL Was just thinking about how amazing our brains are and how when people say that dna is like computer software they\\'re seriously underselling dna.\\nBiology rules! Listening to her talking about different topics is so relaxing 5:40 it\\'s really interesting to sit here watching you draw these numbers, if I take away the notion that I know you\\'re drawing numbers in a sequence, and I strictly focus on what you\\'re drawing, I can pause the video and ask my self, is this a recognizable symbol yet? no, this doesn\\'t look like anything quite yet.  Even though I know it\\'s going to be a 5 I can still see it in this way of \"does this represent something?\" \"is this a symbol for something?\" and I can become more and more sure that it is a 5 with each pixel you draw...\\n\\nMy brain must be operating quite similarly with it\\'s neurons, and I think how funny this is to realize it in this way.\\n\\non a side note, I went to brilliant and saw the 145$ price tag, and thought I should youtube to see more of the thing I saw briefly on someone else\\'s video, and boom, here you are looking at exactly that, wonderful! I dont understand anything of this videos but i still watch them You’re not alone 😂 A relaxed look\\nMe: closing my eyes and just listen to her soothing voice!\\n\\nVery interesting! How is the trained information saved? Love it! Keep making great videos! BTW, any chance you could make a video on tensors? I think it\\'d be interesting to see how you approach them. Thank  you from Spain! as a cs major this was honestly quite refreshing, i think we sometimes forget why any of this exists, ... When it comes to the introduction to any code I have always found a higher level overview was best. Which I have always done with a separate program. The only one know is called raptor. Looking at it dates me a bit however I think that a view from that level is crucial. A compliment for you: you are a beauty!❤ this is very interesting! thank you for this video! I was bored so I clicked on this video because it looked interesting.....22 mins later I know Neural Networks.... well at least the basics 😂 This was great. I learned a lot and chilled at the same time. Love this Congrats! Having a cat is the best decision i ever made in my short life. Perfect quarantine material I could literally hear your voice everyday! 😍 So soothing! @rational guy okay😅😂😂 She doesnt like creeps Awesome video as usual!!! Always look forward to you talking about so many interesting topics! You inspire me to keep learning new things. You’re amazing tibees 😊 ~L   e   M   o   N~ Lol. I\\'m just doing a similar German course on neural networks <3 I love how you use videos of your cute cat as the interludes:) Even though I don’t fully understand this (actually I understood so much thanks to Toby).This could briefly gave me an idea on how this works in the future... Thank you! She makes me want to learn a lot 😍 Well Explained! Thanks for sharing. ✌️✌️ Thanks for the video tibbs, always good to see content from you in this bumbling shitmess of a year. The calming music in the background 😊 Tibees you are simply magical. Great info and I just love listening to your calm voice. Keep up the great vids. Cat at the beginning = instant like, favourite, share and already sending the datas to potential alien civilizations for a peaceful first contact in the future. why kind of cat is that I must know. you had me at cookies and celery :) Nice video Toby, thanks - I learnt something today.\\n\\n\\nAnd great to see that a nice, playful cat like Lemon has chosen to adopt you! Thank you for your content and consideration. I send you videos to inspire  so keep it up! i got some chills with that voice tibees <3 This is pretty great, Are you interested in Robotics as well? your voice is relaxing. Im pretty sure if you taught me in school I would of fell asleep but in a nice way i just play your videos both to relax and to learn and love physics ! 🤓 Now that\\'s what I\\'m talking about! ✋🏽Corona 5 me on that one, Tibz. You def. spazzed. It\\'s wow! And One more thing, You are so adorable Ms. Tibees!🤗🤗🤗 Chamdi perfect timing! inform and relax yourself with Tobi! \\n\\nI am taking courses on Data Science and Epidemiology right now... while trying to make some money on the site with helping out market research institutes. when you cant actually work  and just sit at home playing games and reading a TON of books otherwise, this is a good side thing to do :P I\\'m a new subscriber and I start to knew that your videos are inspiring   so I hope u won\\'t stop inspiring me with ur videos I know has nothing to do  with the video,but u have a similar cat to my cat :p The Hermione of mathematics… Hi Tibees, I am a woman in tech who suffers from math anxiety. I somehow managed to have a career in STEM despite that. Having technical concepts explained to me in such a soothing voice really helps me a lot with focus. Thank you and please make more of these instructive videos, maybe on more advanced topics if possible! Beautifully Explained :-) C, O, H and D - these are cool\\r\\nF - i guess i saw something like that\\r\\nT - are those hands... i mean, legs... i dont know\\r\\nY - ok, i think thats enough for today Depends on NN type, Activation Fn and data type. As you told need to do some data processing before, sometime standardize or just make data more differentate easier (among datasets or data mateix itself, for me Taylor or FF transgormation). Also the data process help about the data units problem as you told. :) I love cats.\\nBrilliant! Thank you for the proof that brilliant would be a waste of money to me. Watching this at 2x speed this was all remedial to me. This was a good video. ANNs are an incredible and powerful tool to model a set of data, but they have many pitfalls as well. Use with care and be aware of its limitations! Keep doing your thing, Tibees! Sister, can you unbox Chennai Mathematical institute\\'s Admission exam.\\nThis is tougher than JEE Advanced You are so sooting and calming to watch.Best learning youtube channel really.Keep it up😍😍😍 Stay safe mam \\nAlways great to hear from you I wish you could narrate my life I\\'d always be calm 6:00 ah yes, the famous ftwiveo superposition of <2,5> \\n\\nVery nice video though! @Tibees No worries. It is actually a nice example of now these systems also often get things wrong and that people should learn about them instead of blindly trusting them and their implementations. oops didn\\'t notice this before When it said mirror neurons I just assumed …. Great! Keep it up And you are lovely, loveable and mathematical and such, and i\\'m sorry to telling you that Most calm voice  I ever heard❤😊 Nice, loved the intro You should be a science ambassador : ) Even that send your email ID Purrfect section transitions :) Aww she is so cuteee :) thanx for the walk through - I have the subscription but have not started a course yet - this video motivated me!\\n\\nI\\'m a developer by day (and/or night) but have not yet dabbled in these higher level abstractions, but as you break it down it seems more manageable for me to approach 👍 Smart. Thanks for sharing. Nice. I learned this at brilliant.org Hola!, i like so much your videos.. =D Can you help me to know from where can i learn statistics and probability required for data science and machine learning. Love! :) You have a skill for captivating the audience without resorting to spectacle. I could tune in for a long time 👍 10/10 need more cats My chats with H.C.Verma.\\n\\nRespected Sir,\\nI was going through your book. H.C.Verma\\'s Concept of Physics (Part 1 and 2). There were a few well defined patterns, which I observed. I would like to give a suggestion.  \\n\\nIt would be useful, if you keep a database. Of all of the formulas, present in the book. The number of formulas, will not exceed beyond 700(Around 10 sub topics in each chapter, that adds up to around 500. For fifty chapters. Plus, gave some room for extras). Like keep a separate \"Appendix\", for it. So, one can quickly refer to the basic formulas.\\n It would also useful, because there are a few questions. Based  on multiple concepts(from different chapters). So, one need to go that specific page, in that specific chapter. To solve that question.\\nEntire book, in 30 pages. Is good to see. \\n\\nI hope. You take my suggestions, sincerely under consideration.\\nYours sincerely,\\nNilay Barot I signed up for a annual brilliant subscription based on the fact that they had some interesting courses in the pipeline but never seem to publish them. I believe they create catching course titles and say they are \\'coming soon\\' but they never will as they are just ways of deceptive selling. I just want to sit down and listen to you educate me all day lol Tibee Libee. Libee means my heart in Assyrian or chaldian. It seems weight + activation function from Minksy in 1960\\'s and fixed multi-layer from 1980\\'s McClelland hasn\\'t changed. At this rate, it\\'ll take the age of the universe to get anything really useful (ie, artificial woman!) Do the machine learning class by Andrew Ng on Coursera Tibees. You don\\'t have any ego. That\\'s what I like about you ',\n",

US NAVY and you SO SO SO missed the technique explanation. To the point of explaining paddling a kayak as \"flailing around with a stick thing\". Just for the record: It deletes my thumb up everytime I scroll. Happens with all other videos too. Anyone having the same experience? @Ms. Elite Thank you Penny. You know, I just figured, it\\'s not cool for the people making the videos if the Likes-Data is kinda corrupted(not sure if that\\'s the right english expression). @Ms. Elite Thanks. But honestly, did it for quite some time already. And still, doesn\\'t work. But I appreciate your advice🙂👍 I just smoke some weed and then I\\'m out Well that’s one way Honestly guys, what was that? It had nothing to do with sleep techniques or what you’re meant to do. Just two people semi flirting 😄. If anything one hopes that a potential date in the near future might be possible, with improved sleeping arrangements. 👍🏾👍🏾 Fast Company Honestly I watched it twice...I was just distracted by them 😉 Penny Proud They have such great chemistry. She was so nervous around him too...’prelaxation’..really? 🤣❤️ They should do more...and boy you could so tell she’s staring  at that beautiful shiny head of his at the end...mmmmmm :) Go ahead and try that again. The technique is explained, step by step, starting at 0:48. Screens will do it to you every time.

The boys on the train are going to be sorely disappointed when Zach gets on without any cake. Haven\\'t laughed this hard since before we were all in quarantine So you don\\'t need something funny to laugh? Shaky shaky laugh lol This was the alternative script for Apocalypse Now You can tell the cameraman pissed himself when Mark had that peace land on his head yea you even hear him laugh lol @drumboarder1 3:23 Was that in this one? Or the video with the beer? “Put it in Tupperware” That container is definitely Decor. I am just glad that Marc didn\\'t go into some type of Italian character when he mentioned Rome.

The part where Mark just says \"When in Rome\" and just laughs at the camera gets me every time The start of this is like Harry forcing the potion on Dumbledore in book 6 I\\'m pretty sure over the years we have been watching Broden become a broken man Kurt Tite broken kelly 1:35 when essential workers ask the government for a pay increase You know, once they started smearing cake on each other I was like \"Wow, this is very reminiscent of their Haven\\'t You Done Well series,\" and then I looked at the title again and was like \"Ah, you boys. It\\'s about time. Another fine addition to the HYDW saga.\" when are they gonna do more hot soop I miss some scalding hot soop on my scalp. “Put it in Tupperware” \"Well if you\\'re not coming back, ....................have some cake.\"\\n\\nThis might honestly be the hardest I\\'ve ever laughed.  Your videos are masterpieces LMAO What a waste of cake. Here take some of my cake There\\'s always room for some Christmas pud Optimus Crime have some 🎂 Omg I can\\'t believe they actually got Josh Hartnett in for this every day our boys look more and more like far cry 5 enemies PUT IT IN TUPPERWARE!!!!! There\\'s so much cake in this video that it\\'s stressing me out This takes the cake This is officially one of my most favourite videos on youtube. Nice to see you giving Zach\\'s enormous forehead some much needed sun protection. They\\'re trying a new cake-based concealer. When the world needed them most, they returned. Welcome back, boys! That guy that walked in and was denied cake from Broden was the infamous Harry Bickmore from those Harold Plotter\\'s. fantastic, thank you boys.\\n\\n\\nvoice of a generation. Ah I remember going to my first birthday party. Went a little something like this but it was laced with meth... According to the clock on the kitchen wall this sketch took about 35 minutes to film I bet they were still full from all that cheese \"Keep the Gladwrap\" 😆 This became a Haven\\'t You Done Well I need a 2 and a half hour long horror movie about Broden drowning his boys in cake As an American, I\\'ve literally never seen this situation occur in real life.\\nHow can there ever be any cake left? P U T I T I N T U P P E R W A R E ! ! ! This is all portraying broden as a very intense and aggressive host We know, THEY KNOW, that this sketch should end when they ask if there are any mini quiches. But it doesn’t, it doesn’t end, it keeps going as it beats you into comedic submission... @Aunty Donna I really feel there could have been more cake. I mean, they didn\\'t even take any. well they had all this cake and it would be a shame to let it go to waste Maxim Reeve coulda been longer imho Just noticed you can spy an unconcious Zach on the floor at 1:54 after getting suffocated with cake You have no idea how much i freaked out when i saw this in my feed Or just doesn\\'t appreciate sketches wasting tons of food. I\\'ve been missing that Tupperware container for five years and an aunty Donna video isn\\'t the most surprising place I thought I might find it I laughed so hard I spat all the cake on the floor Alternative title: Visting Nan This is why you serve pudding instead of cake. There’s always room for a lil puddin n custard 1:45-1:50\\nThere you go boys, a 5-second summary of the video for if you\\'re in a hurry. 4:03 should’ve transitioned into the slippy floor episode from there Love the character breaks... but I love the fact that your making videos again even more... Someone get these boys some free internets! An accurate depiction of real events 2:11\\nLove the callback to Haven\\'t You Done Well 2 My favourite part was when the guys asked for some and he said no Shaz MkSwaz that really upset me you know what would make me feel better. If you took some cake Shaz MkSwaz YEAH MAN ‘COS IM A FUCKIN CHARITY this sketch really takes the cake boys 0:38\\n\\n\\nThe exasperated \"No, no\" from Zach kills me. Is this the long awaited Pud 2?! The person who really deserves some cake is the person that had to clean all that up afterwards. I can\\'t stop watching this. I\\'ve watched at least 10 times so far. Nothing else has ever brought me such joy This is just like when my friend tried to hand me all the cake at the end of a party Northcote MDMA house party!... Its been a while since i last laughed this hard on my own. Why does it always descend into absolute chaos hahahaha I JUST SCREAMED IN LAUGHTER OMG god this was so good This would pair beautifully with a $30 bottle of wine! Oh my god it\\'s been so long I miss you bois :D Boys I’m crying and my face hurts from laughing never stop making these masterpieces i CAN\\'T breathe due to the amount of tears in my eyes right now <3 this could\\'ve also been titled: \\'when you go visit grandma\\' ',\n",

Jay, do you remember a video you made in 2013 or so, saying that ram speed does NOT matter. Yeahhhhh....might wanna delete that shit. I would like to see AMD test bench with this same scenario. yeah at what point does cpu speed if any do you need faster ram to keep the system running fine Techspot already did a good job at this. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uHdEavdBVH0c0LnWnwbUWDxC306YgnKir_W3ticgdYQ/edit#gid=0 @r Actually, Zen+ decoupled the memory controller speed from the Infinity Fabric speed. and they kept that with Zen 2. i also would like to see this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IY_KlkQK1Q\\ngamers nexus The 4 essentials of RAM.\\n-RAM size\\n-RAM speed\\n-RAM timing\\n-RAMMSTEIN du hast Ramstein Air Base, Germany  ---  Good times and home of the HQ for U.S. Air Forces in Europe.

Me too but still it didnt work Heard it at Barnacules first 😂 EZ-PZ video title fix: \"Does RAM speed REALLY matter if you have a $1200 GPU and a $1500 CPU.\" Timing is the number of clocks it takes to do something, or that you must wait to do the next thing.  Speed is the number of clocks per second.  Generally, certain operations take a fixed amount of time to complete -- things like selecting rows and columns of memory cells.  So, at a certain point, if you want to increase the speed (clock ticks per second) you have to increase the timing (number of clock ticks to wait) so those particular operations that take a fixed amount of (real-world) time have a chance to complete before the results are expected. whats the relationship between speed and timing? RAM can be thought of as a \"cache\" between: Storage - CPU\\n\\nL3 is the cache between: RAM - CPU\\n\\nAs the speed goes up (storage >SDRAM >L3 >CPU) so does cost.\\n\\nWhen cost goes up, size comes down: L3 is super fast but its sized is only measured in MB.\\n\\nThen the question becomes: \\n\"what is the tradeoff between RAM speed vs. size?\"\\n- my answer being: the size is defined by the dataset aka. workingset.\\n😉 ...a little!\\nPerformance results of a whole system... RAM is involved during runtime, so it matters but is not the main bottleneck. Phil\\'s personality brings a smile to my face each time he goes into one of his editing humor  :) JayzTwoCents!  I would love to see you do a video titled:\\n\\n\\n\"Anything can be a smoke machine if you use it wrong enough.\" I would be interested in seeing a ryzen 3000 series comparison. @Tradwarden We just saw a huge improvement even on an Intel system proving that fast memory helps intel too. In fact this is more helpful than on Ryzen because its easier to find Ryzen and memory speed performance benchmarks over Intel @Robin Waters European Union. Or just Europe in general. +1 @Posiris EU? Not sure what that means :( @Nope Nada i bought the same board thats how i know, i did buy the the wifi version though That Rammstein bit made my day haha absolutely your content Jay, you and your team work so hard and educate the masses and keep us up to date on all the tech of today and the future. Microcenter is literally so good it’s like an in person newegg rando01 I am blessed to have one near me If there was a microcenter in my country it would be a dream. Sadly they don’t have many stores around. That error boot was perfectly timed.. that pc wanted to make him look bad. @AColdDarkGentleBruh pft highly doubt it With all the obviously scripted humour on this channel, wouldn\\'t surprise me if they did something to make it do that.... Hi, I would love to see if RAM-speed matters when playing \"Planetary Annihilation\". I think it is really memory intensive, because when the game finishes loading, it already draws 8GB of RAM without any game progress. The needed memory raises when the amount of units raises (when the game progresses). Why would it draw that much? Either that game is ahead of its time or it\\'s badly optimized. Please test on a Ryzen 3000 too, maybe show 1% lows to see if they\\'re affected. @James Parkes i had my 3600 18--22-22-22-42 kit OCd to 16-18-18-18-36 @ 3600 \\u200b@El Diablo It does improve drops, but there is more factors than just that. AMD tends to like low CL\\'s, where Intel\\'s like freq speed. It\\'s all about the IMC, and what gives that specific CPU its best performance. Like was stated in the original comment, questioning how this would perform on AMD 3000\\'s. 3200 CL14 is a great option for AMD, giving 1 click performance without having to tinker with timings, both in price, and ease to the user. @James Parkes Try the Ryzen DRAM calculator. You might be able to get tighter timings that are more stable than XMP, since some XMP profiles aren\\'t well optimized for Ryzen systems. @Artcore103 I get that, but most of these viewers are just going to enable their RAM profile, and leave that alone. My PC is running 32GB gskill 4266mhz CL17\\'s, but I\\'ve tuned it stable to CL16. That\\'s not a common thing for average users. It\\'s better for the average user to make sure they get RAM that fits their motherboard QVL, and has good timings. Seems like AMD optimized RAM is more common at 3200 CL14 than for intel. Which makes sense, as intels IMC is optimized for speed, not lower latency. Although, 4266 CL16 is no slouch. It\\'s just expensive. RAM speeds not being set is now the highest single cause of lack of performance in VR titles, in my experience. \\nVR is very,  very sensitive to frame times. same test with ryzen 9 3900x: YES! I had just watched an Age of Empires match so for a second I thought this was talking about battering rams. 11 Jay, it\\'d be very interesting to see some bench tests run on the upcoming Flight Simulator in Aug. That\\'ll be an extremely resource heavy title. Wait, I just watched this same video made back in 2019 with the same Rammestein joke.  Am I in the matrix? @Di Viexi new camera maybe, upgraded from potato. or doing what we do at work, always reinventing the same thing. Pr0sacK I genuinely wonder why they decided to make this same video only 6 months later. Not only that but he learned these lessons back then as well so why is he acting surprised that his “prediction” was wrong? I think AMD would be a better test bed for this. AMD benefits a lot from memory speed. I may be wrong but I don\\'t think Intel would show as much benefit. @fayssal mekh He made another video that you can watch \"Does RAM affect Ryzen CPU performance?? Watch and learn!\" @fayssal mekh AMD is Trash you scrub @fayssal mekh Yeah, because he runs amd for his own rig and Phils editing station he is a massive intel shill. \\n\\nReally...?\\n\\nGet real and hop off the meth for a while. It is clearly not good for you. I think Hardware Unboxed made benchmark video for Ryzen CPU with Fast vs. Slow RAM speeds and it sure makes a difference having faster clock/CL timing. First gen Ryzen yes. The rest, not so much. I\\'d love to see people including photoshop in their tests when it\\'s relevant (like here). Working on sometimes images up to 4go heavy this software is a bottomless pit for ram. \"We\\'re trying to create a situation here where we\\'re CPU limitted\"\\n- Sets all games to Ultra ultra game settings requires not only gpu but cpu power too, obviously resolution and post processing excluded. Huh, I did not know that \"auto\" does no selects best timing settings. Thanks for the tip. ...i have come to the conclusion after deep thinking in the dark: you must be a fan of Rammstein! ( good for you and Germany... I definitely want to see more of this testing on AMD and at higher resolutions! @fayssal mekh Jayz is a real gamer who needs every last frame. @Bobbycat GT Ey! Heh @MrMilkyCoco not 100% true. Some games like civilization or starcraft 2 are less gpu bound due to less intensive graphics but have WAY more units on screen (talking hundreds-thousands) all with movement and special effects. Dane Walsh that RAM is available in CL14 Definitely Samsung Die CL16 can still be high quality non Samsung Die 🤔 \"But first we need to pay some bills\" Best way to introduce an ad 🤣👌 In My experience I got more fps in watch dogs 2 just by enabeling xmp, thx man! 3:53 @Phil, your laugh is the best! Makes me laugh every time you do. You should have done this on Ryzen, then you\\'d be really demonstrating a platform where memory speed matters. Ah yes, the yearly \"does RAM speed matter\" video @Gabryel Mittryng You say that like it\\'s so difficult to purchase a modern display invented in the last few years. 1080p is really old. It\\'s way past time to upgrade. @Magpie Grun Look at this sad human that feels better about himself and superior to others because he is playing games above 1080p.... Jem de Jager Lmao, me too. I\\'ve watched  ram speed videoes once every year for the last 5 years💀 @ThaiDYE don\\'t take your case as a generality!!\\r\\nI would say that 6 out of 10 players play on 1080p screens, 3 out of 10 on 1440p and finally just 1 out of 10 on 2160p! XD I swear to god i miss phil’s laughing at jay lol for real 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yeahhh, test on AMD as well pls!! Im pottentialy creating one in a near future and this would bem good info! Could you test other titles like cs:go And pubg? Keep up the good work guys! Chrome\\nThat game seems to be 102% based on ram. 3200speed - 3600 speed increases performance by 69% 0:29 - opportunity to say ‘trip down memory lane’ squandered I\\'m just getting into PC gaming and thanks to you and Linus(LTT) I\\'ve XMP\\'d and haven\\'t looked back! Thanks for the tips! He had the perfect opportunity to say let’s take a walk down memory lane in the beginning but he did not take it I would really enjoy seeing the test for Ryzen aswell I\\'m blessed to live only 20 plus miles from  St. Davids Micro Center store. Best computer store Ive ever shopped. Yes the saint David’s micro center is the best one. All praise the saint David’s micro center I wish I was that close to one with all the deals I hear about this place. *cries in canadian* Jay: \"We\\'re assuming people\\'s computers are WORKING, Phil-\" \\nTest bench: X( I laughed out loud at the beep beep beep 😂 litreally X( X( X( X( Test bench: Aight chief imma head out I’ve noticed that WoW FPS really increased with ram speed 3:45  * I\\'m literally slow-clapping right now * COD MW3. I see that when I overclock my 7700k to 5.2G with 3600MHZ DDR4, it was much faster then if I used 2666MHZ or 3200MHZ DDR4. I mean I could play much better at the game with the 3600MHZ as opposed to 3200MHZ. The results were impressive when I ran my bender blenchmark. We all know why u didn\\'t use the RGB RAM, no motherboard can handle the extra 5000mhz from the RGB Is it ok to use an \"Intel XMP Certified\" Ram on my ryzen? I\\'m glad I saw this video. For some reason my memory speed was set super low. I switched to XMP mode and gained nearly 200 point in Cinebench. Would like to see this done with AMD as I\\'ve been thinking of switching over to a 3800x I already OC\\'d my Ram and tighten up the timings and stuff and have been doing this for 3-4 years because I\\'ve seen the results first hand... WHY TF DO I STILL CLICK ON THIS VID AND WATCH IT TO THE END?! Fortnite stock vs xmp is 80+ fps difference hmmm wonders if there would be a wider difference on minimum detail settings or would the computer explode I so wish I lived closer to a Micro Center, they reminds me of how great Frys Electronics was some 10 years ago. Hell yeah, I would love to see the AMD side of this I was just wondering about this today ! Lol I was trying to figure out how to do this on my ram. My bios isn\\'t super friendly Too Freaking sick to hear jay sings Rammstein! ^^ and RAM in german is also called Ramstein ^^ keep up going jay! love ya videos! learnt so much from you! 3:48 That could not have been timed better. Godly timing is godly... Phil\\'s laugh xD From Phil belting out lyrics to Du Hast, then the perfectly time boot failure...man I love this channel lmao I got a really good laugh from that timing. Who doesn\\'t need one of those rn 😂 That one gave me a good laugh! 🤣🤣 Hey Jay, requesting the AMD version. Please run the test with AMD 3rd gen processor, would love to watch it, Thanks 😍 Please do the same test with AMD!!!\\n\\nI am planning on building a PC with a Ryzen 3600 and 2070 Super, and I want to see exactly what my per $ spend on Ram will get me in performance Same Oh my gosh, I died. That was hilarious! 🤣 3:45 0:29 you missed a golden opportunity to say \\'today we\\'re going to take a trip down memory lane.\\' @James Clifton didn\\'t even know that. It\\'s hard to read all the comments. \\u200b@James Clifton Both of those people can GET OUT >:( @Aron \\nscroll thru hours worth of comments??? that shit is posted literally 2 comments down, but the joke was corny as hell either way so... @James Clifton considering most people don\\'t scroll through hours worth of comments, and the comment box is at the top, its probably because it \\'s not a unique memorable (SEE?! GET IT?!) pun. @James Clifton people can have the same idea Yeah, well, I think I\\'ll just keep messaging the del key I have a full and system I would like to see you do this same test when you get a chance Does RAM speed make difference in music production software where almost all processes are sequential and only single-core CPU performance matters? Thankyou for the shift click restart. Damn, what a time saver. I think it would have been good to show the 1% and 0.1% Lows. It seems like in a lot of benchmarks the faster ram speed can help bring up the FPS lows more than just a straight FPS increase. Yeah, slow ram or cpu can cause microstutters 👍 Faster RAM especially with AMD processors makes a big difference. Oc\\'ed to 4600Mhz there is less stuttering in all the large world BR games I play. Exactly. Max fps doesn\\'t make any sense - avg fps is kinda important - but 1% and 0.1% low are the most important ones. @Subham Biswas a good review methodology wouldn\\'t include loading screens. 0.1% is still useful. at 100fps (avg) that\\'s still once every ~10s which would still be plenty noticeable if it was very low. Also intresting would be on whats more important: High Mhz-Count or Low CL-Timing. RAM can be aa fast as it wants as of pure Mhz but i think a high CL-Timing like lets say 24 will seriously bottleneck the System. However it would be intresting to see to what degree the CL-Timings affect the system. I wonder how the division 2 will react. Me and my freinds had some problems with ram Don\\'t \"We\" love computers \"Hey Jay\" :D @4:41 not sure if you guys noticed when Jay says \"When you speed up the memory\" you can hear a car speeding up in the background and the engine roaring! lol perfect timing! I would love to see an AMD video with this type of same setup, well as close as you can get. I pose a question would you have to do it with the Trident Neo Ram made for AMD or just regular Trident Ram or other ram? And how big of a difference would it make. I was all ready to start typing \\'what about AMD, that is RAM speed critical\\', glad I watched to the end.\\nPlease repeat the tests with Ryzen, and see which is more dependant on ram speed these days. @Dennis Marzan actually, that is one of the reasons why I like this channel. I can find numbers and reviews anywhere, but opinions, especially ones I trust, are harder to find. @Dennis Marzan is your name frank? cause frankly no one asked you... You could find reviews in other channels. This channel is garbage, talks a lot without conclusion yessirr @_ xid _ just 98% of it. Speed in mhz is essentially your memory bandwidth and your cl is basically how fast it can send receive. The rest will make a slight difference Same test with AMD, please! I just got a brand new AMD build 2 days ago, mostly inspired bu your work! this is exactly what I needed to learn. Please redo when the new AMD Ryzen gen 3\\'s come out. I\\'m interested in seeing Ryzen tested. I have a 3600 in the mail coming to me right now Love the music when the graph is showing, can anyone tell me who they are I couldn\\'t stop laughing when Phil started speaking German with Rammstein\\'s lyrics tfw when linguists are attacking your comments section when all you wanted was to enjoy Phil being funny @Marc Schulz Arabian or Chinese is also very hard (for a native German speaker like me;) ). @Nefertenia There are way harder and more awkward languages out there, but it all depends on your native language and other languages you speak. For English speakers, German really isn\\'t that hard. I\\'m currently learning Italian, and it really melts my brain (as a German native speaker. Spanish, French and Portuguese speakers should have much less trouble). @Blur 410 nah don\\'t worry. I could get a good picture of your skills and why it is that you are working for \\'zeh angry luftwaffle\\' xD\\n\\nNah just kiddin ich :P german is one of the most frkn arkward languages you possibly could try to learn :D german tech language is filled with english names. I sometimes can\\'t even remember the german word for parts 😂 He was just WAITING for you to say \"Ramstein\" XD Pretty sure Overwatch is pretty memory speed dependet actually, when i was running a i7 4770 and 1070 ti i got really ustable frames while both of them werent maxed out. Pretty sure that had something to do with ram speed but i could be wrong. Great work! I would love to see you testing it with an AMD Ryzen 3000 CPU. Thanks! Escape From Tarkov, still beta game but would\\'ve been fun to see! :) \"It\\'s not a bug, it\\'s a feature\" said every engineer ever Chaks243 I feel attacked. Amazed that you know who Rammstein are and I love it. Excelen Jay, please run same test on Ryzen, looking forward to it, big thanks ! Could you please review RAM and DAW\\'s, thanks a lot!!!! Hey Jay. Doing the test again on amd would be great.\\nNow in regards to titles that are memory dependent this might or might now be - but - they are cpu dependent: Cities Skylines ( get all the dl\\'c ) and ANNO 1800. \\n\\nTry them out and let us know. We\\'d really love to see how AMD processors reacts with different memory speeds! @Lucas O haha It’s AMD so it’ll probably crash either way @DoitDoug true true it would be pretty fun to see tho as I have a ryzen 5 3600 with 2tb memory an 16gb 3200 ddr4 ram running a GTX 1660 an would like to see what kind of peramiters are good to run @Best Of Ark That would be close to the theoretical limit. I bet it would be fast as hell. There would need to be some serious materials advancement just to deal with the heat. I would like to see the ryzen 5 age of empires ii definitive edition usually cost my pc 20gb of ram to run and play, Its actually ridiculous. RAM is cheap these days, we have three PCs with 32GB, plus the rugrat\\'s one running 16GB, he was offered 32GB... Finally I heard Jay speaking german 🥰 (kinda 😂) Woah, an MC plug? Used to work there, I know they’re aggressively against commercials but I guess they never said anything about plugs like that depending on the application, yes, it does. moving on. Same test with AMD.\\nAlso, a test with different rated ram speeds and same speed ram with different timings. You\\'ll need DDR4-3200 at CL14, and DDR-3600 at CL16 for the best overall performance in Ryzen 3000 systems.  You\\'ll have a 1:1 clock with the CPU with great latency.\\nGoing beyond to something like DDR4-4000 will require you to manually set timings yourself, but the performance gain is worthwhile if you\\'re successful. I need this I\\'m running DDR3000 C14 with things other timings because it runs better than DDR3200 C16 with worse other timings, on R3600 @ 4.3Ghz all core. Gn has a video like that full of details! Check it out. Yes, I got 32gb of ddr4 for free. It\\'s only 3000mhz but the timing is really good, something like 15 15 something I can\\'t remember. Battlefield usually responds very well to increased RAM speed! I wonder how would memory speed affect GPU\\'s with 4 gigs of memory. That soundtrack....Hell YEAH! 6-10% i gained from overclocking the memory for 4k gaming.. I would love to see an AMD test with this So I think of this like 1:1 being a pipeline that’s a certain diameter and the timings latency being the pressure in the pipe, and 2:1 is the pipe becoming larger but loosing pressure (looser CL) but the volume (bandwidth) being moved is more? @Fandango It\\'s how the CPU bridge works for current gen AMD,  Kinda hard to explain in a comment, depends silicon lottery, some motherboard will allow 3733 or 3800 at 1:1, but it\\'s probably safer to just stick with 3600 @Fandango It\\'s how the AMD processor/chipset handles the faster memory.  It runs 1:1 until it hits 3600Mhz then it loosens up the faster you go.  I think one of Jay\\'s previous videos explained it better & it may have had something to do with the infinity fabric/SoC part of the CPU. @Fandango it\\'s a limitation of Zen 2 memories controllers. Basically an overclock very few chips can hit. @sub1ime81 what’s the reason for switching the ratio from stock 1:1 to 2:1? Hey Jay, can you test do some tests on Rust? I believe it is a very memory and CPU dependent game but I’m not sure Would love to see the same tests on the AMD side, considering doing a ryzen based system within the next year. I can vouch for the diminishing returns on higher resolutions. I cleared CMOS the other week and forgot to set DCOP on afterwards. I\\'d been playing for a few weeks at 2133Mhz instead of 3600mhz and didn\\'t notice the difference at all. Apex Legends, BF4/V, DOOM were some of the titles I was playing before and after. \\n\\n\\n3440x1440\\n3700X\\n2080 Ti\\nTrident Z Neo 3600 I would like to see 3rd generation AMD Ryzen benchmarks :-) I\\'m a simple man, i hear Rammstein, ich drücke like!

That is the way we use the alt tag.\\r\\n\\r\\nI personally prefer the 2nd statement. I also know both are correct in their point of view.\\r\\n\\r\\n Now please tell me which one more correct and Why? 2nd one Gracias i have not buy domain name , SEO Works in My Website ??

I still have the scars all over my hand from when the hydrogen and oxygen exploded (to make water) but was too intense and my hand was too near the beaker. I don\\'t know what went wrong. My nuclear physicist husband didn\\'t understand how a person could mess up the making of water, but you couldn\\'t SEE the elements at all. It was like putting NOTHING into the beaker - until it exploded all over my hand & I needed to go the Emergency Room.\\nI hated that you couldn\\'t see what the hell you were putting into the beaker. It was the creepiest sensation I\\'ve ever had. I knew EXACTLY how those people in Harry Potter felt not being able to see the Thestrals. It was a weird feeling to be putting elements into a beaker and seeing nothing happen, then all of a sudden hearing an explosion and seeing some water along with blood. Hows that hand feeling thanks for showing us👍👍 hi it is a great movie. \\nmay  I know what   the music is?? u r awsome Thanks that was really helpful I hate physics😩 it doesn\\'t make any since at all, whatsoever, in any shape or form, my brain just doesn\\'t connect to physics language😂 Music WAY too loud in the video, made it unbearable.. Do u have a degree in physics ? to be looking at physics i see it as a collection of other sciences mainly: math, chemistry, astronomy and a little bit of biology When i watching this feel so exited !! Make more please this so great and lovely VDO. It make children love to learn Physics more. May I share this vdo to our friends? Hey psychology is a science and we ask how all day. I would change that intro to include psychology or to say \"No other physical science does this\" +Daniel Waring Wrong! :) psychologists ask the how also, and every day are doing experiments asking the how. anyways it was the way he worded it that was not technicality true its not a big deal... +doubleu1992 no, psycologists ask why...why does the brain operate in such a manner? the how is down to brain chemistry, and subsequently physics. +doubleu1992 Very true!

THANNNNKKKKKKKK YOU *WHEW Thanks brother 👍..now im interested to know more i was watching this video for moving object without my hand touching them Thank you for knowing HOW to explain  physics :) ❤ This looks like it will be quite dank, you better continue to upload in MIT I like your mission but the sound quality of this vid was not good. I don\\'t know if it was the mix or poor enunciation (not trying to be rude or mean)? I found myself rewinding to understand what you said 3-4 times and the last time I gave up. Thanks.

OMG it’s really good thank you so much ZHASIK TI SMOTREL VIDOS Haaaaaaaa iiiiiiiii love physics I\\'ve heard some big brain explain physics as the study of momentum and all related smallest to the largest paraphernalia & characteristics to it. Thank you!!!! I am writing a book and I needed some basic instruction on physics. I look forward to more of your lessons. Yeh u can do it bro cmon go up I hope you will do great Bob Albury  good luck Im 9 but my parents are scientists and they always talk about PHYSICS !!! so i watched this video it was interesting but some things i dont  understand Rouslan Moukhametzianov aw that’s cool that you’re interested in what your parents do/ talk about Thanks for the great information. Are you able to suggest a book on Physics for a beginner? Check out this It will help you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owrLaNd96vs&t=6s Thank you help in science Physics is always interesting subject Sir I think physics involves questions on Why and how!\\nWhy time goes forward?\\nWhy do two masses attract each other?

I think I lost my remaining brain cells RBSE BOARD MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF PHYSICS || Learn Physics with me \\nEasy Lecture series It phenomenal I loved it......concepts cleared😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘 Thanks. Physics is my favorite subject 😊😊😊😊\\n😉 This never took off I suppose 00:46  Thats my type of people The physics is easy with you thank you could wwe study mathematics and physcis self I have taught/teach physics, biology and chemistry. I had to respond to your assertion that no other science looks at the how question. I am sorry to have to tell you this but you are incorrect. Biology most certainly seeks to answer the question how... how do cells work? how does a virus infect a cell? how does it cause illness? Chemistry does the same thing... how do bonds work? etc. Physics is the most fundamental science for sure, we couldn\\'t do much of anything in the other fields without the basic laws of physics but to say that its the only science that answers this question is wrong. I am joining high school  next year, and I\\'ve watched all of these videos but still scared  of physics . Do you think you can help me? Checkout my channel for awesome physics problems , hopefully it will be of great help for you There is nothing to be scared of sis. Physics is literally just how things work. Easy thanks sir for your great guidess please tell us more about physics 10 class It\\'s never for nothing, everything has an origin(beginning) sheldon: *inhales* Thanks teacher my pro you Really good! Thank you! Throws sulfuric acid then explodes the car? I think not! Thank you so much this help me e lot you are the best keep making videos waiting for our lessons!!!!!!!!! Amazing savior Just saw this video and I like it, but I\\'m wondering why you\\'ve only uploaded one video in a year? Lukey B. The Physics G I see, look forward to watching more then. Oh, and as I am in no way scientifically gifted, the visuals/animations help a lot. :) Vanessa O hey! glad you liked the video. I sadly lack free time as of recent since I\\'m currently going through my first year at MIT. But, I am planning on making more videos once I can find time to :) more videos! +legendly awesome more will come out soon! So study about atoms and molecules is physics or chemistry? In 9th std we had it in physics and in 11/12 std, we had it  in chemistry. You\\'re a atom Biology is the best ! Background music is irritating pls remove that The music is louder than the vocal This is my most hated subject🙃 Wouldn\\'t you say \"what are physics\" I still don\\'t get it 😂😂😂😂😂 lets just say i was never mean to be smart.

This is how they got there patches: Once there was a shepherddes that went to a forest with only white pandas when the shepherddes died every white panda wore black armbands and they cried but when they rubbed their eyes the patches appeared the pandas never wash the patches as a memory of the shepherddes Pandas poop up to 50 times a day OMG 😍 they are so cute 😍 (๑´•.̫ • `๑)(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤(♡ω♡ ) ~♪ෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆ(灬º‿º灬)♡( ˘ ³˘)♥ ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ bruh 47:02 Uururuiror\\nEod,krl\\nK,ele\\n\\nKele\\nKe\\nOel that is how wrestling works LOL WHO DOSENT LIKE THEM?

RUMPS UNDVOLLRAUSCH don’t know 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ but I do know that mothers usually give birth to 2 at a time, abandoning the weaker one and keeping the stronger one for higher survival rate. So to keep both alive, the zoo keepers have to constantly switch the baby, giving the mom the illusion that she is still taking care of one. This is during right after birth, when baby panda grow bigger maybe they are all grouped together as playmates So cute and human like.\\n♡♡♡ 1:10 Did he say Wulan?

It is disgusting. So what are you suggesting? They release 15 captive-born females into the wild so they are spoiled for choice and can do it in privacy then expect the ill-equipped pandas to make their way back to the reserve in 3 days? Your level of stupid is more disgusting. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PANDAS ARE SO ADORABLE Betul😁😁😁😁😁 Hola Pandas are the Best So as they\\'re breeding them they\\'re letting some go into the wild ? As they bring more in they need to release more. That\\'s how \"saving a population works. You don\\'t keep breeding and keeping all of them,  that\\'s stupid. The stupid one is you. They have succesfully released 9 pandas since the re-wild program was initiated but there\\'s a process into selecting which ones are ready to go. They can\\'t just release  captive-born animals at the same rate they breed because not all of them will have developed the skills to survive in the wild. Are you seriously suggesting that if they are able to birth 15 pandas a year, they should release 15 other pandas into the wild to make it even? That\\'s not how it works. You have no common sense. Do some research before making dumb comments on issues that require a little thinking. the   giant    panda    ailropoda      melanoluca      literally    black      and     whtie     cat     foot     chinese\\npinyin     da      xlong      mao      literally    big     bear     cat     also      known     as      panda     is     a     bear\\nnative    to     south      central      china      it     is      easily      recognized      by      the    large      distinctive     black     patches     around Nut Nut Beautiful panda i love animals 💖💖👌👌👍👍 adorb It is very nice And I want  any panda is o hug Not good for the visually impaired, subtitles don’t work. Bye bye The irony of it is that humans try to control the population while panda breeding is enforced, human mating is done privately or if anything public mating has attached stigma while here we are watching the mating of pandas to the point of cheering them as if we reached orgasm too... I DONT LIKE THE WAY THAT LADIE TREATED THE PANDA\\'S :\\'( Same... Just to clarify, it’s very normal to grab cubs of all species by their necks , lions, dogs, cats, they all carry their cubs this way. Also, panda cubs are very durable, especially due to their habit of falling while climbing bamboo. Anna Mizzi this is bullshit! I am so sick of you ignorant saints. You thinks you know more and are holier anyone else. Put away your arrogance and educate yourself in pandas. Maybe you won’t be so ignorant, Throwing around unjust judgements and be condescending to the people who are professionals and actually saving the animal. Pandas are meant to be carried by grabbing their back skin. They are bears, that’s how their mother handles their cubs. You have to remember that this is in a VERY different country. \\n\\nAlthough they care for their Panda’s, they don’t treat them as well as other developed countries. Chancey Cattleman me too that was sad are they forcing pandas to mate... They are an endangered species and time is running out.. you have to do what you have to do in order to save them. It would be beyond sad for them to go extinct and future generations to never witness the beauty of them. A lot of animals facing extinction have breeding programs. they would do better in the wild not behind bars being watched by everyone...horrible..who can mate like that? yes they are not very well treated..theyshould leave them ALONE.. in the nature...horrible place..like a jail They are endangered species time is there they are trying to keep them alive and help them reproduce and help them out would you rather them go extinct Maria DOLORES Rodriguez Ferrere de MERCADO pandas literally poop in front of your face. They don’t care. I don’t know about mating though. But I don’t think you should project human emotions to animal behaviors to derive answers. There are many possible reasons why captive mating may be better than mating in the wild, like budget, ease of observation for studying the behavior, etc. shame on them. They have imprisoned poor animals. They are endangered if they are not there to help then those gergous creature and the species can be no more I don\\'t want them to go extinct Boring, if they can\\'t mate, their extinction clock is near, let hem be, the ccp should give the ppl political choice, not focusing on stupid panda How do you expect that female to mate again she was terrified. Raped and attacked I’m no panda expert but mating her again will be hard to impossible. @Doppelganger D true they know what there doing I would rather let them do there thing then let them go Extinct bannane girl no you, they are right A W I agree really @KylePH and @A W\\nOk congrats thanks for noticing perfectionnists , I never asked to look all smarty-ass perfectionnist or so I just went based on my values , I’m not gonna argue on something that will lead me to nowhere : great y’all are educated in animals , pets or whatev congrats , don’t take me wrong I was just following my values and emotions so whatttt ????

I\\'ve been there and I didn\\'t even know that. @@Finn Stratford : So it\\'s a territory. Johnboydownunder give me a break. At least I know now. What good is this information going to do me in the future. @Burths exactly what the fella in the video said It was administered by the Department of the Interior (and later by the Department of the Capital Territory) as if it were part of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), although it has always been a separate Commonwealth territory. The perception that it is part of the ACT stems from the fact that under the terms of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act, the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory. In 1989, when the ACT achieved self-government, the Department of The Arts, Sport, The Environment, Tourism and Territories took over responsibility for the JBT\\'s administration, and it has since been administered by various Commonwealth Departments responsible to the Minister for Territories. It is an independent territory.

Isn\\'t cyan the one of Ports colors? Hard to take a Collingwood fan seriously \"IS NOT THAT SIMPLE\"😂😂😂\\nUm portuguese\"AI É  MUITO DIFÍCIL\" wonderful and fantastic country! Really wanna live in Australia! The Australian accent part got me! I have a slight infatuation with Australia! Aussie have no accent lol\\nITS YOU Less than 2 minutes in into the video and I\\'m dying over how you pronounce things. It\\'s not your fault, all non aussies do it. Draco Malfoy when he said melbOURNe I died I\\'m non australian and look at this.\\nSydney- Sydney \\nCairns- Cans\\nMelbourne- Melban\\nBrisbane- Brisban\\nUhhhhh, Adelaide-.....Adelaide\\n\\nI think that\\'s about most cities many americans pronounce wrong. Give me a list cities you know an american would pronounce wrong and I\\'ll tell you how they are actually pronounced. @Draco Malfoy I know that your Father is going to hear about this. haha Canberra The way he says \"Canberra\" is so funny When you know Australia lost to BIRDS ming c45672 when you play ROBLOX i have memories of watching this with my cousin\\U0001f9cd\\u200d♀️we had the lyrics memorized Just started watching. You are brilliant!!  I love how you present geography. You should be in every school. I wish you great success. God bless you. 🇺🇸 5:10 did he have a gaol thing on his leg or what ever you call them. \"Australia is always there to back up USA when it\\'s in need of allies\" The real question is would the US do the same Not anymore, China controls us @Don Holloway Not a couple others. The Aussies have been in more wars alongside the US than even Canada. Kaotic Phoenix they probably wouldn’t USA : cash me outside Kaotic Phoenix nope they wouldnt A video about Australia without mentioning the time when they lost a war to frickin birds?....TWICE!!! This video needs an update! Love  Australia From Turkey! I got dibs on New Jersey!  (If they ever do a states version) I can set the record. Like, statue of liberty is ours. All that. I\\'ve lived in Australia all my life and had no idea about any of those sovereign territories or the fact that the Australian Capitol Territory not exist anymore! Nice work. Hi Australians, I just wanted to say I like your country :) Ty Andrew Kirk - Allan A Martin PS (1223)   Thank you! Andrew Kirk-Allan A Martin Thanks mate but if you come here for God\\'s sake don\\'t make a bloody video after you have been here a week and make out you know everything about Australia lol. This twit didn\\'t know his Canberra from his Northern Territory. Oh thats right there are more\\'animals that will maim you in Canberra. Nice to see a positive comment. Aw thx American, we like all of ur actors (especially the guy that plays Sheldon cooper) Thanks  mate What about ANZAC? (Australia New Zealand Army corps) “They spread like wildfire”\\n\\n\\n\\n*Literally* I guess our relationship in Australia has some relation to what we have in common, both former British Colonies, both have massive and diverse Rough and Tumble landscapes and biomes, and we love to barbecue and consume copious amounts of beer. Country: *Has stereotypes*\\nPaul: S O N G  T I M E ']"
