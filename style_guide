Naming Conventions
    CSS:
        Variables should follow the `$component-state-property-size` formula for
        consistent naming. Ex: $nav-link-disabled-color and $modal-content-box-shadow-xs.

        Tabs should be 4 spaces wide for easy reading and distinguishing between tab groups.
    
    JS:
        Class names should use pascal case with the ` ` formula for consistent naming.
        Ex. StyleGuide and SearchBar and MediaVideoEncoder.

        Variable names should use camel case with the ` ` formula for consistent naming.
        Ex. styleGuide and commentHistory.

        Tabs should be 4 spaces wide for easy reading and distinguishing between tab groups.
